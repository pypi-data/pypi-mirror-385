We distinguish target types by looking at sample target values of available databases.

* ``binary``: single (binary) target, where negative labels are set to zero and
   positives to 1.
* ``multiclass``: multiple (binary) outputs, one-hot encoded where
  negative/positive are encoded as in the binary case. Each sample is assigned
  exactly one, and only one, label.
* ``multilabel``: multiple outputs, where each sample may have more than one
  label.
