"""Definition of a sample.

A dictionary containing an arbitrary number of keys and values.  Some of the
keys are reserved, others ignored within the framework, and can be re-used to
hold sample metadata required for further analysis.

Reserved keys:

* ``input``: This is typically a 1, 2 or 3D torch float tensor containing the
  input data to be analysed.
* ``target``: This is typically a torch float tensor containing the target the
  network must try to achieve. In the case of classification, it can be a 1D
  tensor containing a single entry (binary classification) or multiple entries
  (multi-class classification).  In the case of semantic segmentation, this
  entry typically contains a float representation of the target mask the
  network must decode from the ``input`` data.
* ``mask``: A torch float tensor containing a mask over which the input (and
  the output) may be ignored.  Typically used in semantic segmentation tasks.
* ``name``: A name for the sample.  Typically set to the name of the file or
  file-stem holding the ``input`` data.
