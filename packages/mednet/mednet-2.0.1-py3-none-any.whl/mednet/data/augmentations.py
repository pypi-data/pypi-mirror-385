"""Image transformations for our pipelines.

Differences between methods here and those from
:py:mod:`torchvision.transforms` is that these support multiple
simultaneous image inputs, which are required to feed segmentation
networks (e.g. image and labels or masks).  We also take care of data
augmentations, in which random flipping and rotation needs to be applied
across all input images, but color jittering, for example, only on the
input image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img
        The input image to apply elastic deformation to.  This image should
        always have this shape: ``[C, H, W]``. It should always represent a
        tensor on the CPU.

        The numpy random number generator to use.
    alpha
        A multiplier for the gaussian filter outputs.
    sigma
        Standard deviation for Gaussian kernel.
    spline_order
        The order of the spline interpolation, default is 1. The order has to
        be in the range 0-5.
    mode
        The mode parameter determines how the input array is extended beyond
        its boundaries.
    p

        The image with elastic deformation applied, as a tensor on the CPU.
