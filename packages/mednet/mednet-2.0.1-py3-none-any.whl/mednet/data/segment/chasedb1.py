"""CHASE-DB1 dataset for vessel segmentation.

The CHASE_DB1 is a retinal vessel reference dataset acquired from multiethnic
school children. This database is a part of the Child Heart and Health Study in
England (CHASE), a cardiovascular health survey in 200 primary schools in
London, Birmingham, and Leicester. The ocular imaging was carried out in 46
schools and demonstrated associations between retinal vessel tortuosity and
early risk factors for cardiovascular disease in over 1000 British primary
school children of different ethnic origin. The retinal images of both of the
eyes of each child were recorded with a hand-held Nidek NM-200-D fundus camera.
The images were captured at 30 degrees FOV camera. The dataset of images are
characterized by having nonuniform back-ground illumination, poor contrast of
blood vessels as compared with the background and wider arteriolars that have a
bright strip running down the centre known as the central vessel reflex.

* Reference: :cite:p:`fraz_ensemble_2012`

Data specifications:

* Raw data input (on disk):

  * RGB images encoded in JPG format with resolution (HxW) = 960 x 999 pixels.
  * Vessel annotations are encoded as PNG images with the same resolution as
    input samples.
  * Masks for the eye fundus are provided by this package.
  * Total samples: 28

* Output sample:

    * Image: Load raw JPG images with :py:mod:`PIL`, with auto-conversion to RGB.
    * Vessel annotations: Load annotations with :py:mod:`PIL`, with
      auto-conversion to model ``1`` with no dithering.
    * Eye fundus mask: Load mask with :py:mod:`PIL`, with
      auto-conversion to model ``1`` with no dithering.

Split ``first-annotator`` contains 8 training samples and 20 tests samples
annotated by expert 1.  Split ``second-annotator`` contains the sample samples
as in ``first-annotator``, but annotated by expert 2.

This module contains the base declaration of common data modules and raw-data
loaders for this database. All configured splits inherit from this definition.
