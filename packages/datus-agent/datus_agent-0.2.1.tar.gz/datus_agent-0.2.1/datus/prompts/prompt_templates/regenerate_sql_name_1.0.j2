Please generate a new unique name for the following SQL query, avoiding the conflicting names provided.

**Comment:** {{ comment }}

**SQL Query:**
```sql
{{ sql }}
```

**Current name:** {{ current_name }}

**Conflicting names to avoid:** {{ conflicting_names }}

Please provide a new name in the following JSON format:
{
    "name": "New unique descriptive name for this SQL query (max 20 characters)"
}

Guidelines:
- Create a short, memorable identifier (max 20 characters) that captures the essence of the query
- Must be different from all names in the conflicting list
- IMPORTANT: Keep the same language as the comment - if the comment is in Chinese, generate name in Chinese; if in English, use English. Do NOT translate between languages
- Focus on making it descriptive but unique
- If the comment is empty or unclear, infer the purpose from the SQL structure and table/column names
