Please analyze the following SQL query and its comment, then extract a concise summary in JSON format.

**Comment:** {{ comment }}

**SQL Query:**
```sql
{{ sql }}
```

Please provide the analysis in the following JSON format:
{
    "summary": "Brief 1-2 sentence description of what this SQL query does and its business purpose",
    "name": "Short descriptive name for this SQL query (max 20 characters)"
}

Guidelines:
- Make the summary concise but descriptive
- Focus on the business purpose and what data is being accessed/manipulated
- Include key entities, operations, and business context
- For the name field: create a short, memorable identifier (max 20 characters) that captures the essence of the query
- IMPORTANT: Keep the same language as the comment - if the comment is in Chinese, generate both summary and name in Chinese; if in English, use English. Do NOT translate between languages
- Keep all values as strings
- If the comment is empty or unclear, infer the purpose from the SQL structure and table/column names
