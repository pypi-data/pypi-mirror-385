"""Code Developer Coordinator for implementation.

This module coordinates the code_developer agent to implement priorities that have
technical specifications, ensuring zero idle time through continuous work delegation.

Architecture:
    - Identifies next PLANNED priority with spec
    - Delegates implementation to code_developer
    - Tracks implementation progress
    - Ensures CFR-013 compliance (roadmap branch only)

Related:
    SPEC-104: Technical specification
    US-104: Strategic requirement (PRIORITY 20)
