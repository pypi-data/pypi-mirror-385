"""File Ownership Registry for enforcing document ownership boundaries.

This module implements CFR-001 (Document Ownership Boundaries) by providing
a centralized registry that maps files and directories to their owning agents.

The registry uses glob patterns to match file paths and determine ownership,
ensuring that only the designated agent can modify specific files.

Architecture:
    FileOwnership: Static class with ownership rule matching
    OwnershipViolationError: Exception raised when ownership violated
    OwnershipUnclearError: Exception raised when ownership ambiguous

Usage:
    >>> from coffee_maker.autonomous.ace.file_ownership import FileOwnership
    >>> owner = FileOwnership.get_owner(".claude/CLAUDE.md")
    >>> print(owner)
    AgentType.CODE_DEVELOPER

Key Features:
    - Glob pattern matching for flexible ownership rules
    - Comprehensive ownership matrix from CRITICAL_FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md
    - Clear error messages for violations
    - Support for special cases and dual ownership scenarios
    - Caching for performance optimization

Integration:
    - Used by generator agent for ownership enforcement (US-038)
    - Prevents file conflicts (CFR-000 - MASTER REQUIREMENT)
    - Enables auto-delegation to correct owner

    This class implements CFR-001 (Document Ownership Boundaries) by providing
