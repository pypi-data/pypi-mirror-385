#### Enhanced CLI Main (`sbdk/cli/main.py`)
- **Global Options** available to all commands:
  - `--verbose, -v`: Detailed debug output with logging
  - `--quiet, -q`: Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
  - `--dry-run`: Preview mode without executing changes
  - `--format, -f`: Output format (text, json, yaml, table, minimal)
  - `--project-dir, -p`: Specify custom project directory
- Context management integration for all commands
- Improved help documentation with usage examples
- `no_args_is_help` for better UX

#### New Commands
- `sbdk completion`: Generate shell completion scripts (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
- `sbdk query`: Query DuckDB database with built-in SQL interface
  - Show all tables with row counts
  - Execute SQL queries directly from command line
  - Interactive SQL mode with syntax highlighting
  - Rich formatted output tables
  - Integration with project configuration

#### Project Template Enhancements
- Added `query.py` helper script to all new projects
  - No installation required (uses Python duckdb package)
  - Interactive SQL mode
  - Execute queries from files
  - Comprehensive help and examples
  - Automatic database discovery

#### Enhanced Commands
- `sbdk version`:
