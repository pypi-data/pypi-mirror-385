.SH NAME
vespa-deploy - Deploy (prepare and activate) an application package


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvespa deploy [application-directory-or-file] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Deploy (prepare and activate) an application package.

.PP
An application package defines a deployable Vespa application. See
https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/application-packages-reference.html for
details about the files contained in this package.

.PP
To get started, 'vespa clone' can be used to download a sample application.

.PP
This command deploys an application package. When deploy returns successfully
the application package has been validated and activated on config servers. The
process of applying it on individual nodes has started but may not have
completed.

.PP
If application directory is not specified, it defaults to working directory.

.PP
In Vespa Cloud you may override the Vespa runtime version (--version) for your
deployment. This option should only be used if you have a reason for using a
specific version. By default, Vespa Cloud chooses a suitable version for you.
