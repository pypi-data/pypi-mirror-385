.SH NAME
vespa-destroy - Remove a deployed Vespa application and its data


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvespa destroy [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Remove a deployed Vespa application and its data.

.PP
This command removes the currently deployed application and permanently
deletes its data.

.PP
When run interactively, the command will prompt for confirmation before
removing the application. When run non-interactively, the command will refuse
to remove the application unless the --force option is given.

Cloud. See https://docs.vespa.ai/en/cloud/deleting-applications.html for how to remove
production deployments.

containers in use by the application. For example:
