.SH NAME
vespa-feed - Feed multiple document operations to Vespa


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvespa feed json-file [json-file]... [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Feed multiple document operations to Vespa.

.PP
This command can be used to feed large amounts of documents to a Vespa cluster
efficiently.

.PP
The contents of json-file must be either a JSON array or JSON objects separated by
newline (JSONL).

.PP
If json-file is a single dash ('-'), documents will be read from standard input.

.PP
Once feeding completes, metrics of the feed session are printed to standard out
in a JSON format:
.IP \(bu 2
feeder.operation.count: Number of operations passed to the feeder by the user,
not counting retries.
.IP \(bu 2
feeder.seconds: Total time spent feeding.
.IP \(bu 2
feeder.ok.count: Number of successful operations.
.IP \(bu 2
feeder.ok.rate: Number of successful operations per second.
.IP \(bu 2
feeder.error.count: Number of network errors (transport layer).
.IP \(bu 2
feeder.inflight.count: Number of operations currently being sent.
.IP \(bu 2
http.request.count: Number of HTTP requests made, including retries.
.IP \(bu 2
http.request.bytes: Number of bytes sent.
.IP \(bu 2
http.request.MBps: Request throughput measured in MB/s. This is the raw
operation throughput, and not the network throughput,
I.e. using compression does not affect this number.
.IP \(bu 2
http.exception.count: Same as feeder.error.count. Present for compatibility
with vespa-feed-client.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.count: Number of HTTP responses received.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.bytes: Number of bytes received.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.MBps: Response throughput measured in MB/s.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.error.count: Number of non-OK HTTP responses received.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.latency.millis.min: Lowest latency of a successful operation.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.latency.millis.avg: Average latency of successful operations.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.latency.millis.max: Highest latency of a successful operation.
.IP \(bu 2
http.response.code.counts: Number of responses grouped by their HTTP code.
