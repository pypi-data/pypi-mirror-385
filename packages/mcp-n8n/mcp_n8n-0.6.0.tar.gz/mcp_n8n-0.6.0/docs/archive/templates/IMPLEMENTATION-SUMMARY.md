# DDD/BDD/TDD Development Lifecycle - Implementation Summary (Template)

## How to Use This Document

> Replace placeholders such as `{{INTEGRATION}}`, `{{integration}}`, and any sample file paths with the names that match your MCP server integration before sharing broadly.

## Overview

The {{INTEGRATION}} team successfully established an integrated **Documentation Driven Design (DDD)**, **Behavior Driven Development (BDD)**, and **Test Driven Development (TDD)** lifecycle supported by automated DevOps quality gates. This summary captures the work completed, assets delivered, and follow-up actions required to keep the process healthy across all MCP server repositories.

**Completion Date**: 2025-01-01
**Implementation Window**: 3 weeks
**Scope**: Foundational process, testing, and automation setup for {{INTEGRATION}} MCP tooling.

## Deliverables

### 1. Process Documentation
- `docs-generalized/process/development-lifecycle.md` — End-to-end workflow overview (DDD → BDD → TDD → CI/CD)
- `docs-generalized/process/ddd-workflow.md` — Documentation-first playbook and anti-patterns
- `docs-generalized/process/bdd-workflow.md` — Scenario authoring, pytest-bdd patterns, and review checklist
- `docs-generalized/process/tdd-workflow.md` — Red/Green/Refactor guidance with illustrative examples

### 2. Templates Library
- Tool implementation template describing user stories, acceptance criteria, API signatures, and rollout checklist
- Feature or epic specification template covering scope, architecture, migration impact, testing strategy, and rollout plan

> TIP: Store templates under `templates/` (or a shared docs repo) so every MCP project can re-use them without changes.

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- Standardized test tree: `tests/features/`, `tests/step_defs/`, `tests/contracts/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/regression/`
- Shared pytest-bdd fixtures (`tests/step_defs/conftest.py`) with reusable Given/When/Then steps for tool invocation
- Sample feature files demonstrating permissions, CRUD flows, and error handling scenarios
- Contract test harness to validate tool signatures and response shapes before implementation

### 4. CI/CD Enhancements
- Workflow stages: lint/format → unit → contract → BDD → integration → coverage publishing → deploy (optional)
- Strict quality gates (e.g., coverage thresholds, required scenario pass rate, required reviewers)
- Fast-fail stages with caching to keep CI under 12 minutes on average hardware
- Coverage reporting (Codecov/Sonar) and artifact publishing for feature files, logs, and reports

### 5. Operational Readiness
- Contributor guide updates describing the lifecycle expectations
- Pull request checklist aligning reviewers on documentation, tests, and automation requirements
- Onboarding runbook for new engineers (recommended: 90-minute live session + recorded walkthrough)

## Implementation Timeline (Reference)

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Discovery & Planning | 3 days | Audit current state, align on goals, identify gaps |
| Process Authoring | 5 days | Draft and review DDD/BDD/TDD documents and templates |
| Test Infrastructure | 4 days | Set up pytest-bdd, shared fixtures, and contract tests |
| CI/CD Automation | 3 days | Extend workflows, configure quality gates, document pipelines |
| Enablement & Handover | 2 days | Host workshops, update contributor docs, obtain approvals |

Use the table as a baseline and adjust durations to match the size and maturity of your integration.

## Highlights & Lessons Learned

- **Documentation First Pays Off**: Reviewing API docs before implementation eliminated late-stage rework and aligned stakeholders.
- **Executable Requirements**: BDD scenarios doubled as onboarding material for new contributors and prevented regressions.
- **Contract Tests as Guard Rails**: Signature validation caught interface drift early, especially when multiple repos consumed the same tools.
- **Automation Coverage**: Converging on one workflow per repo simplified support and encouraged contributions from other teams.
- **Shared Vocabulary**: Using consistent naming (`{{integration}}_tool`, scenario tags, branch names) reduced confusion across repos.

---

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Expand Scenario Coverage** — Prioritize high-risk tools and user journeys until BDD scenarios cover ≥90% of critical paths.
2. **Automate Metrics** — Track coverage, scenario counts, and failure trends in CI dashboards to surface regressions quickly.
3. **Periodic Process Reviews** — Schedule quarterly audits of documentation, templates, and CI gates to keep guidance current.
4. **Cross-Repo Adoption** — Add this docs-generalized package as a Git submodule or copy into sibling MCP repos to standardize practices.
5. **Continuous Training** — Rotate brown-bag sessions showing real PRs that followed the lifecycle end to end.

## Success Metrics (Template Targets)

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Documentation-first adoption | 100% of PRs require updated docs | Enforced via PR checklist |
| BDD scenario health | 100% pass rate, ≥90th percentile scenario reuse | Block merges on failure |
| Test coverage | ≥85% overall, ≥90% unit, ≥80% integration | CI gate with trend reporting |
| Pipeline reliability | ≥95% success, <12 min duration | Monitor via workflow dashboard |
| Team enablement | 100% engineers complete onboarding | Track attendance & feedback |

Customize thresholds to your team's risk tolerance and regulatory needs.
