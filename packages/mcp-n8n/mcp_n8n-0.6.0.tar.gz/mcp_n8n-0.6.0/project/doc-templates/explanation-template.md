# {Concept Name}

## Overview

What is this concept/decision? High-level summary (2-3 sentences).

## Context

**Background:** What led to this design/concept?

**Problem:** What problem does this solve?

**Constraints:** What limitations did we work within?

**Alternatives Considered:** What other approaches were evaluated?

---

## The Solution

### High-Level Approach

Description of the solution with diagrams if applicable.

```
┌─────────────┐
│  Component  │
│      A      │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       │ interaction
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Component  │
│      B      │
└─────────────┘
```

### Key Decisions

**Decision 1: {What we chose}**
- **Rationale:** Why we chose this approach
- **Trade-offs:** What we gave up
- **Alternatives:** What we considered instead

**Decision 2: {Another key choice}**
- **Rationale:** Reasoning
- **Trade-offs:** Compromises made
- **Impact:** How this affects the system

## How It Works

### Component Breakdown

Detailed explanation of how the parts work together.

**Component A:**
- Responsibility
- Key behaviors
- Interactions

**Component B:**
- Responsibility
- Key behaviors
- Interactions

### Interaction Patterns

Explain the flow/sequence of operations:

1. First, this happens...
2. Then, this component does...
3. Finally, the result is...

### Example Scenario

Walk through a concrete example:

```
User Action → Component A → Component B → Result
```
