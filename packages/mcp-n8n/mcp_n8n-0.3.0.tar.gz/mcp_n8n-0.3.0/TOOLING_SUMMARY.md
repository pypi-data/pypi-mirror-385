# Tooling & Best Practices Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Complete âœ…

This document summarizes the tooling improvements implemented to align mcp-n8n with best practices for a single-developer multi-instance workflow.

---

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Pre-commit Hooks âœ…

**Files:**
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook configuration

**Features:**
- YAML validation
- End-of-file fixing
- Trailing whitespace removal
- Large file detection
- Ruff linting with auto-fix
- Ruff formatting
- MyPy type checking

**Usage:**
```bash
pre-commit install        # Install hooks
pre-commit run --all-files # Run manually
```

**Notes:**
- Configured to exclude `temp/` and `repo-dump.py`
- Added type ignore overrides for third-party libraries (fastmcp, pydantic, pytest)

---

### 2. Task Automation with Justfiles âœ…

**Files:**
- `justfile` (mcp-n8n)
- `chora-composer/justfile` (for consistency)

**Available Commands:**

#### Common Tasks
```bash
just install       # Install dependencies
just setup         # Full setup (install + hooks + check)
just test          # Run tests
just test-coverage # Run tests with coverage
just lint          # Run linting
just lint-fix      # Run linting with auto-fix
just format        # Run code formatting
just typecheck     # Run type checking
just check         # Run all quality checks
just pre-commit    # Run pre-commit hooks
just verify        # Run full verification (pre-commit + tests)
just clean         # Clean build artifacts
just run           # Start the server
just run-debug     # Start with debug logging
just info          # Show environment info
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent interface across both projects
- Easier than remembering individual commands
- Self-documenting (`just --list`)

---

### 3. Development Scripts âœ…

**Files:**
- `scripts/setup.sh` - One-command project setup
- `scripts/integration-test.sh` - Sprint 2 Day 3 integration checkpoint
- `scripts/handoff.sh` - Context-switch automation

#### setup.sh
**Purpose:** One-command project setup
**Features:**
- Checks Python version (3.11+ required)
- Installs dependencies
- Sets up pre-commit hooks
- Validates environment configuration
- Runs quality checks and tests

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

#### integration-test.sh
**Purpose:** Sprint 2 Day 3 checkpoint validation
**Features:**
- Validates chora-composer event emission
- Tests mcp-n8n event parsing
- Verifies trace context propagation
- Groups events by trace ID

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/integration-test.sh
```

**Note:** Currently uses mock events. In Sprint 2, will call actual chora-composer.

#### handoff.sh
**Purpose:** Automate context-switch between instances
**Features:**
- Checks for uncommitted changes
- Runs quality checks
- Generates SPRINT_HANDOFF.md template
- Provides step-by-step handoff instructions

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/handoff.sh chora-composer  # Switch to chora-composer
./scripts/handoff.sh mcp-n8n         # Switch to mcp-n8n
```

---

### 4. GitHub Actions CI/CD âœ…

**Files:**
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Test workflow
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` - Lint workflow

#### Test Workflow
**Triggers:** Push and PR to main/develop
**Matrix:** Python 3.11 and 3.12
**Steps:**
- Install dependencies
- Run pytest with coverage
- Upload coverage to Codecov
- Run mypy type checking

#### Lint Workflow
**Triggers:** Push and PR to main/develop
**Steps:**
- Run ruff linting
- Run ruff formatting check
- Run black formatting check

**Benefits:**
- Catches issues even in single-dev workflow
- Validates changes across multiple Python versions
- Ensures code quality before merge

---

### 5. Configuration Improvements âœ…

**Files:**
- `pyproject.toml` - Updated mypy and ruff configuration
- `.gitignore` - Added temp/ and repo-dump.py exclusions

#### pyproject.toml Changes

**Ruff:**
- Moved `select` to `[tool.ruff.lint]` section (fixed deprecation warning)

**MyPy:**
- Added `exclude = ["temp/"]`
- Added overrides for missing imports:
  - `fastmcp` and `fastmcp.*`
  - `pytest` and `pytest.*`
  - `pydantic`, `pydantic.*`, and `pydantic_settings`

**Code Changes:**
- Added `# type: ignore[misc]` comments for:
  - `BaseSettings` subclasses in `config.py`
  - `@mcp.tool()` decorator in `gateway.py`
- Fixed line length issues in `chora_composer.py` and `gateway.py`

## Impact on Single-Developer Multi-Instance Workflow

### Before
- Manual quality checks
- No automated testing on context switch
- No standardized handoff process
- Inconsistent tooling between projects
- Manual dependency management

### After
- **Automated quality checks** via pre-commit hooks and CI
- **Integration checkpoint** ensures cross-instance compatibility
- **Standardized handoff** with scripts/handoff.sh
- **Consistent commands** via justfiles
- **One-command setup** for new clones

---

## Key Benefits

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**
   - Single command interface (`just <task>`)
   - Automated quality checks catch issues early
   - Scripts handle repetitive tasks

2. **Safer Context Switching**
   - Integration tests validate compatibility before switch
   - Handoff script ensures clean state
   - SPRINT_HANDOFF.md template captures context

3. **Faster Onboarding**
   - One-command setup script
   - Self-documenting justfile
   - Clear README instructions

4. **Better Quality**
   - Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
   - CI validates changes automatically
   - Type checking catches errors early

5. **Consistency Across Projects**
   - Same tooling in mcp-n8n and chora-composer
   - Matching justfile commands
   - Shared best practices

---

## Quick Reference

### First-time Setup
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd mcp-n8n
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Daily Development
```bash
just test          # Run tests
just verify        # Full check before commit
git commit         # Pre-commit hooks run automatically
```

### Sprint 2 Day 3 Checkpoint
```bash
./scripts/integration-test.sh
```

### Context Switch
```bash
./scripts/handoff.sh chora-composer
# Follow on-screen instructions
```

### Common Tasks
```bash
just --list        # Show all commands
just run           # Start server
just run-debug     # Start with debug logs
just clean         # Clean build artifacts
```

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Complete** - All tooling implemented
2. **Optional** - Consider Poetry migration if dependency issues arise
3. **Optional** - Add devcontainer support for multi-machine development
4. **Sprint 1** - Begin unified roadmap execution

## Conclusion

All tooling improvements are complete and ready for use. The project now follows best practices for:
- Code quality (linting, type checking, formatting)
- Testing (pytest, coverage, CI)
- Development workflow (justfiles, scripts)
- Context switching (integration tests, handoff automation)

The tooling is optimized for a single-developer multi-instance workflow, reducing cognitive load and ensuring safe context switches between mcp-n8n and chora-composer instances.

**Ready for Sprint 1 execution!** ðŸš€
