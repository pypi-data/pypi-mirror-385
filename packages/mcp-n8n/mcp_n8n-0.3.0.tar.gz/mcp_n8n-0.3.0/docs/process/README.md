# docs-generalized

This directory contains shareable documentation templates for bringing the DDD/BDD/TDD workflow to additional MCP server integrations.

## How to Use
- Copy the `process/` folder into a target repository (or add as a submodule) and replace `{{INTEGRATION}}` / `{{integration}}` placeholders with the integration name.
- Update links, tool names, and examples so they describe the domain of the destination project.
- Keep the documents under version control so improvements in one repo can be ported to others.

## Contents
- `process/` â€” Generalized lifecycle, DDD, BDD, TDD, and implementation summary guides.

Add more shared documentation (reference, templates, how-to guides) here as you generalize them for reuse.
