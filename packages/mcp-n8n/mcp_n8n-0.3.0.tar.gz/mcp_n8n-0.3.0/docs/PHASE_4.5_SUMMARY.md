### 2. Memory Infrastructure

**Directory:** `.chora/memory/`

**Components:**

#### Event Log (`src/mcp_n8n/memory/event_log.py`)
- Append-only JSONL storage with monthly partitions
- Query by trace_id, event_type, status, time range
- Aggregate statistics (count, avg_duration)
- Per-trace correlation (all events for a workflow)

**Event Schema (v1.0):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T12:00:00.123Z",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "status": "success",
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "event_type": "gateway.tool_call",
  "source": "mcp-n8n",
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

**Event Types:**
- `gateway.started` - Gateway server started
- `gateway.stopped` - Gateway server stopped
- `gateway.backend_registered` - Backend registered
- `gateway.backend_started` - Backend subprocess started
- `gateway.backend_failed` - Backend startup/operation failed
- `gateway.tool_call` - Tool routed to backend (future)
- `gateway.context_switch` - Handoff between projects (future)

#### Trace Context (`src/mcp_n8n/memory/trace.py`)
- `CHORA_TRACE_ID` environment variable propagation
- TraceContext context manager for scoped trace IDs
- Automatic subprocess propagation
- OpenTelemetry-compatible UUID format

**Integration with Chora Ecosystem:**
- Follows Chora event schema v1.0 specification
- Compatible with chora-composer event emission
- Supports multi-step workflow correlation
- Enables gateway-backend event correlation

#### Knowledge Graph (`src/mcp_n8n/memory/knowledge_graph.py`)
- Markdown notes with YAML frontmatter (Zettelkasten-inspired)
- Bidirectional linking between notes
- Tag-based organization and search
- Confidence tracking (low/medium/high)
- Content search (case-insensitive full-text)
- Related notes traversal (configurable distance)

**Knowledge Note Structure:**
```markdown
---
id: backend-timeout-fix
created: 2025-01-17T12:00:00Z
updated: 2025-01-17T14:30:00Z
tags: [troubleshooting, backend, timeout]
confidence: high
source: agent-learning
linked_to: [trace-context-pattern]
---

# Backend Timeout Fix

## Problem
Backend subprocess fails to start within 30s timeout.

## Solution
Increase MCP_N8N_BACKEND_TIMEOUT=60
...
```

**Files:**
- `.chora/memory/notes/*.md` - Individual knowledge notes
- `.chora/memory/links.json` - Bidirectional link graph
- `.chora/memory/tags.json` - Tag index for fast lookup

#### Memory Architecture Documentation

**File:** [`.chora/memory/README.md`](.chora/memory/README.md) (454 lines)

**Sections:**
- Overview & Architecture
- Memory Types (Ephemeral, Event Log, Knowledge Graph, Agent Profiles)
- Directory Structure
- Event Log Format & Trace Correlation
- Knowledge Graph Format (Notes, Links, Tags)
- Agent Profiles (Per-agent learned patterns)
- Usage Patterns for Agents (Query, Trace, Learn, Context Switch)
- Query Interface (Python API, CLI future)
- Knowledge Management (Create, Search, Link)
- Retention Policy (90/30/180 days for events, never delete knowledge)
- Privacy & Security (no credentials, no PII)
- Future Extensions (Vector DB, Cross-Project Memory, Multi-Agent)

### 3. Testing

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ TraceContext: UUID generation, environment setting, restore previous
- ✅ Event Emission: File creation, schema validation
- ✅ Event Log: Query by trace_id, event_type, status, time range, aggregation
- ✅ Knowledge Graph: Create/update notes, search by tags/text, link notes, traverse related

**Test Results:** All 14 tests passing

### 4. Gateway Integration

**File:** [`src/mcp_n8n/gateway.py`](../src/mcp_n8n/gateway.py) (modified)

**Event Emission:**
- Gateway startup: `gateway.started` with version, backend count
- Backend registration: `gateway.backend_registered` (success/failure)
- Backend startup: `gateway.backend_started` (running/failed)
- Gateway shutdown: `gateway.stopped`

**Trace Context:**
- TraceContext used for gateway lifecycle events
- CHORA_TRACE_ID propagates to backend subprocesses
- Foundation for future tool call tracing

### 5. Configuration Updates

**File:** [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore) (updated)

**Added:**
```gitignore
# Agent memory (ephemeral learning data)
.chora/memory/events/
.chora/memory/knowledge/
.chora/memory/profiles/
.chora/memory/queries/
!.chora/memory/README.md
```

**Rationale:** Memory data is session-specific, not source code. README preserved for documentation.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Exemplar-Driven Development**
   - Following chora-composer AGENTS.md as exemplar ensured consistency
   - Reduced decision paralysis (structure already defined)

2. **Documentation-First**
   - Memory README written before implementation
   - Clarified architecture before coding
   - Enabled comprehensive testing

3. **Modular Design**
   - Event log, knowledge graph, trace context are independent modules
   - Easy to test, easy to reuse
   - Can be extracted to chora-base template

4. **Ecosystem Integration**
   - Using existing event schema avoided reinventing the wheel
   - CHORA_TRACE_ID already specified in roadmap
   - Leveraged existing telemetry infrastructure

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1:** Balancing agent-centric vs. human-centric documentation
**Solution:** Keep human docs unchanged, add AGENTS.md as complementary machine-readable guide

**Challenge 2:** Memory retention policy (how long to keep data?)
**Solution:** Differentiate by data type: events (30-180 days), knowledge (never delete), profiles (persistent)

**Challenge 3:** Privacy concerns with logging
**Solution:** Strict no-credentials policy, metadata-only logging, local-first storage

## Next Steps (Phase 4.6+)

### Immediate Enhancements
