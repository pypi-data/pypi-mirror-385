# Template Relationship Notes:
# - mcp-n8n IS the exemplar that chora-base was extracted from
# - This file tracks which template version we're conceptually "based on"
# - Use for selective sync of template improvements:
#   copier update --dry-run gh:liminalcommons/chora-base
# - Do NOT auto-apply all changes - cherry-pick useful improvements only
