ngio is a Python library designed to simplify bioimage analysis workflows, offering an intuitive interface for working with OME-Zarr files.

## What is Ngio?

Ngio is built for the [OME-Zarr](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/) file format, a modern, cloud-optimized format for biological imaging data. OME-Zarr stores large, multi-dimensional microscopy images and metadata in an efficient and scalable way.

Ngio's mission is to streamline working with OME-Zarr files by providing a simple, object-based API for opening, exploring, and manipulating OME-Zarr images and high-content screening (HCS) plates. It also offers comprehensive support for labels, tables and regions of interest (ROIs), making it easy to extract and analyze specific regions in your data.

## Key Features

### üîç Simple Object-Based API

- Easily open, explore, and manipulate OME-Zarr images and HCS plates
- Create and derive new images and labels with minimal boilerplate code

### üìä Rich Tables and Regions of Interest (ROI) Support

- Tight integration with [tabular data](https://biovisioncenter.github.io/ngio/stable/table_specs/overview/)
- Extract and analyze specific regions of interest
- Store measurements and other metadata in the OME-Zarr container
- Extensible & modular allowing users to define custom table schemas and on disk serialization

### üîÑ Scalable Data Processing

- Powerful iterators for building scalable and generalizable image processing pipelines
- Extensible mapping mechanism for custom parallelization strategies

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Getting Started](getting_started/0_quickstart.md) guide to integrate ngio into your workflows. We also provide a collection of [Tutorials](tutorials/image_processing.ipynb) to help you get up and running quickly.
For more advanced usage and API documentation, see our [API Reference](api/ngio.md).

## Supported OME-Zarr versions

Currently, ngio only supports OME-Zarr v0.4. Support for version 0.5 and higher is planned for future releases.

## Development Status

!!! warning
    Ngio is under active development and is not yet stable. The API is subject to change, and bugs and breaking changes are expected.
    We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Which means for 0.x releases potentially breaking changes can be introduced in minor releases.
