# Graphite Dev

Graphite Dev provides a local assistant runtime with visual workflow tracing. The tool must be executed from the project root directory to function properly.

## Installation

```bash
pip install grafi-dev
```

## Usage

```bash
grafi-dev <path to your assistant instance>
```

Or run from source:

```bash
python -m grafi_dev.cli <path to your assistant instance>
```

This will automatically open a webpage displaying the Graphite interface.

The highlighted components show the main interface elements:

**Header**: Displays the current conversation ID and assistant request ID, with a "New Conversation" button to start fresh sessions.

**Main Panel**:

- **Left**: Visual workflow representation showing the execution flow
- **Right**: Detailed information including events, conversation data, and flow history
  - **Info Tab**: Shows the detailed information of the workflow or selected components
  - **Event Tab**: Shows all the event of the workflow or selected components
  - **History Tab**: Shows complete conversation history across all assistant request IDs.

**Message Input**: Located at the bottom, allows you to send messages directly to the Graphite assistant.
