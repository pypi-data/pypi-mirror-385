Leaky loop tests: Some of these are genuinely nondeterministic in cargo (they
normally pass, but might not when run in the full test suite with threading
because the check of `main` can race the check of `leaky_loop`) and so they are
commented out.

They demonstrate that we get nondeterminism from loop recursion, even with
no placeholder types involved. The loop creates a cycle in the definition of
`x`, and depending where we start the cycle we can get different answers.

The one I've left uncommented is the one where there's no race condition.

Import cycle tests: We can create a cycle of imports pretty easily. If we never
do anything with imported names except forward them, we won't be able to exhibit
nondeterminism because the answer to everything is just `Any` regardless of orders.

But if anything in the cycle is able to actually compute a result (for example,
because it makes a function call that takes a cyclic argument, but the function
itself has a well-defined return type), we will see nondeterminism, because
- If we break the cycle on exactly that element, it will spit out a recursive
  `Var` from the point of view of its dependents, which when forced is typically
  `Any`.
- If we break the cycle anywhere else, the function call will be evaluated and
  we'll spit out a concrete answer (the same concrete answer we'll eventually
  get in the other case when we unwind the cycle back to ourselves), and our
  dependents will see that.
- Note that the nondeterminism *originates* from the place where we break
  recursion, but the *visible effects* occur in the dependents of that element,
  not the element itself.

Unlike the leaky loop tests, these have no variations that aren't potentially
subject to race conditions, so they are all commented out for CI stability.

// The following tests demonstrate that decorator cycles exhibit nondeterminism.
//
// The unit tests themselves are deterministic, because the `main` module (which
// I need outside the cycle for my own sanity) isn't participating directly in
// the cycle, and everything here has a concrete type once it's fully resolved.
//
// But if you run with `--nocapture`, you'll see that the type errors for
// the `xx` and `yy` modules are not consistent between the two tests:
// - In version (a) we get no type errors in xx and a type error in yy
// - In version (b) we get no type errors in yy and a type error in xx
//
// The root cause of the error is that whichever of `fx` / `fy` *doesn't* break
// the cycle winds up with type `int` prior to `@dec` being applied, but
// whichever one *does* break it has type `Any` (until the cycle completes).
