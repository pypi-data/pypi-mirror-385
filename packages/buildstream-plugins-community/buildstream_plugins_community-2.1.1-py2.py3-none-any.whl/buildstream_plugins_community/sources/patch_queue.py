patch_queue - apply patches in the specified directory
======================================================
This plugin applies the patches found in the specified directory
to the working tree in alphabetical order.

.. attention::

   This plugin uses ``git apply`` to apply the patches, as such it
   makes the assumption that the target staging directory is a git checkout.

**Usage:**

.. code:: yaml

   # Specify the git_module source kind
   kind: patch_source

   # Specify the project relative path to a directory containing patches
   #
   path: path/to/patches


Reporting `SourceInfo <https://docs.buildstream.build/master/buildstream.source.html#buildstream.source.SourceInfo>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The patch_source source reports the project relative local path to the directory
containing patches as the *url*.

Further, the patch_queue source reports the `SourceInfoMedium.LOCAL
<https://docs.buildstream.build/master/buildstream.source.html#buildstream.source.SourceInfoMedium.LOCAL>`_
*medium* and the `SourceVersionType.SHA256
<https://docs.buildstream.build/master/buildstream.source.html#buildstream.source.SourceVersionType.SHA256>`_
*version_type*, for which it reports the accumulative sha256 checksum of the patch files as the *version*.

The *guess_version* of a patch source is meaningless, as it is tied instead to
the BuildStream project in which it is contained.
