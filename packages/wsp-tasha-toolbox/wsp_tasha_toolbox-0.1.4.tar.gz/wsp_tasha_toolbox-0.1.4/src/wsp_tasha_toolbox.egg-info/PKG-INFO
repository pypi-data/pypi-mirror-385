# wsp-tasha-toolbox

![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wsp-tasha-toolbox)

A toolbox for working with travel demand models based upon the *Travel Activity Scheduler for Household Agents (TASHA)* model structure.

Tools included in this toolbox are designed to work with models built using GTAModel V4.0+.

The modelling platform for all TASHA-based models (such as GTAModel V4.0+ in the GTHA and implementations in other regions) is developed by the [Travel Modelling Group](https://tmg.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

## Installation

Binary installer for the latest released version is available on the Python Package Index:

```batch
pip install wsp-tasha-toolbox
```
