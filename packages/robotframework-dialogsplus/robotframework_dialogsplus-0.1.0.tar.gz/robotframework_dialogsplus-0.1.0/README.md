# DialogsPlus
A drop-in enhancement for Robot Framework's Dialogs library with modern UI and extended user interaction keywords.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Not supported in headless environments such as CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)


**DialogsPlus** is a user-friendly and fully customizable dialog library for [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), built on top of [`customtkinter`](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). It extends the built-in dialog functionality with rich GUI dialogs that are **stylish**, **modern**, and **configurable** via a simple `config.yaml` file.
