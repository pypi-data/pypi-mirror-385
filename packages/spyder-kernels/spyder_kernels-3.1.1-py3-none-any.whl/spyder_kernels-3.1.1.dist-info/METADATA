Package that provides Jupyter kernels for use with the consoles of Spyder, the
Scientific Python Development Environment.

These kernels can be launched either through Spyder itself or in an independent
Python session, and allow for interactive or file-based execution of Python
code inside Spyder.

To learn about creating, connecting to and using these kernels with the Spyder
console, please read our [documentation](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/ipythonconsole.html).
