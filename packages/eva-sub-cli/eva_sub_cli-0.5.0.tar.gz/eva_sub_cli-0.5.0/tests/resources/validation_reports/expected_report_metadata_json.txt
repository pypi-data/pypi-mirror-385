VCF VALIDATION RESULTS
Checks whether each file is compliant with the VCF specification (http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.4.pdf).
Also checks whether the variants' reference alleles match against the reference assembly.
	input_fail.vcf
		❌ Assembly check: 26/36 (72.22%)
		First 10 errors per category are below. Full report: /path/to/assembly_failed/report
			Parsing error: The assembly checking could not be completed: Contig 'chr23' not found in assembly report
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35549, reference allele 'G' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35595, reference allele 'G' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'a'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35618, reference allele 'G' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35626, reference allele 'A' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'g'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35639, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35643, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'g'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35717, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'g'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35819, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'a'
			Mismatch error: Chromosome 1, position 35822, reference allele 'T' does not match the reference sequence, expected 'c'
		❌ VCF check: 1 critical errors, 1 non-critical errors
		First 10 errors per category are below. Full report: /path/to/vcf_failed/report
			Critical error: Line 4: Error in meta-data section.
			Non-critical error: Sample #11, field AD does not match the meta specification Number=R (expected 2 value(s)). AD=..
	input_passed.vcf

REFERENCE GENOME INSDC CHECK
Checks that the reference sequences in the FASTA file used to call the variants are accessioned in INSDC.
Also checks if the reference assembly accession in the metadata matches the one determined from the FASTA file.
	metadata_asm_match.fa
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		✔ Analysis A: Assembly accession in metadata is compatible
	metadata_asm_not_found.fa
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		❌ No assembly accession found in metadata
			Full report: /path/to/metadata_asm_not_found.yml
			Assembly accession found in metadata: Not found
			Assembly accession(s) compatible with FASTA: GCA_1
	metadata_asm_not_match.fa
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.
		❌ Analysis B: Assembly accession in metadata is not compatible
			Full report: /path/to/metadata_asm_not_match.yml
			Assembly accession found in metadata: GCA_2
			Assembly accession(s) compatible with FASTA: GCA_1
	metadata_error.fa
		Warning: The following results may be incomplete due to problems with external services.
		Please try again later for complete results.
		Error message: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/webservices/contig-alias/v1/chromosomes/md5checksum/hjfdoijsfc47hfg0gh9qwjrve
		✔ All sequences are INSDC accessioned.

	not_all_insdc.fa
		❌ Some sequences are not INSDC accessioned
			First 10 sequences not in INSDC. Full report: /path/to/not_all_insdc_check.yml
				Sequence name: 2
