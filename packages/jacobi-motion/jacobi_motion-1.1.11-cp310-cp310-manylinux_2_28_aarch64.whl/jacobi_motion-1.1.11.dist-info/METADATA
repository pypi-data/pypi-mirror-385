# Jacobi Motion Library

This is the **Jacobi Motion Library** for robot motion planning. It provides a clean API for efficient algorithms that compute time-optimized, jerk-limited robot arm trajectories in milliseconds.

For instructions regrading installation, getting started, and for general documentation we refer to [docs.jacobirobotics.com](https://docs.jacobirobotics.com).
