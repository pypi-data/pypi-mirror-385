"""Tests for widget author/affiliation behavior regression issues.

This module contains regression tests for widget behavior problems identified
by Guillaume in PR #98, specifically related to author data preservation when
adding affiliations.

Key issues tested:
- PR #98: Widget authors being cleared when adding affiliations
- Widget state consistency during updates
- Author/affiliation data integrity
