## [Unreleased]

## [v1.8.4] - 2025-09-29

### Fixed
- **üìÅ Figure Directory Copying**: Fixed `copy_figures_to_output()` to recursively copy figure subdirectories, resolving issues where manuscripts with organized figure folders (e.g., `FIGURES/fig1/`, `FIGURES/fig2/`) had missing figures in the generated PDF
- **üîß Subdirectory Structure Support**: Enhanced figure copying to preserve directory organization while maintaining backward compatibility with flat file structures
- **üìñ LaTeX Compilation**: Eliminated "File not found" errors for figures organized in subdirectories, ensuring all figure references compile correctly

  - **Root Cause**: Cell content like `` `% comment` `` wasn't properly escaping the `%` character inside `\texttt{}` environments
  - **LaTeX Error**: Unescaped `%` caused LaTeX to treat everything after as a comment, breaking table structure with unmatched braces
  - **Detection Logic Fix**: Enhanced `_format_markdown_syntax_cell` to recognize content starting with `%` as LaTeX syntax (not just `\`)
  - **Proper Escaping**: LaTeX comments are now escaped as `\% comment` inside `\texttt{}` to prevent interpretation as comments

  - **Root Cause**: Template processor was using hardcoded `\section*{Main}` header regardless of actual section type
  - **Dynamic Section Headers**: Modified template processor to generate appropriate section headers based on content type
  - **Template Update**: Replaced hardcoded LaTeX section with dynamic `<PY-RPL:MAIN-SECTION>` placeholder
  - **User Impact**: Users writing `## Introduction` now get "Introduction" header in PDF, not "Main"
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Added end-to-end tests that verify actual .tex file generation

- **üêõ Figure Ready File Duplication Requirement**: Fixed requirement to duplicate figure files in both direct and subdirectory locations
  - **Root Cause**: Ready file detection logic was incomplete - when ready file existed, code still converted to subdirectory format
  - **Smart Path Resolution**: Enhanced figure processor to use ready file path directly when file exists at `Figures/Fig1.png`
  - **Fallback Behavior**: Maintains subdirectory format `Figures/Fig1/Fig1.png` when no ready file exists
  - **User Impact**: Users can now place `Fig1.png` only in `Figures/` directory without requiring `Figures/Fig1/Fig1.png`
  - **Working Directory Independence**: Fixes work correctly regardless of current working directory

- **üêõ Full-Page Figure Positioning with Textwidth**: Fixed `tex_position="p"` being ignored for `width="\textwidth"` figures
  - **Root Cause**: Code automatically forced 2-column spanning (`figure*`) for textwidth figures, overriding explicit positioning
  - **Respect User Intent**: Modified logic to honor explicit `tex_position="p"` even with `width="\textwidth"`
  - **Smart Environment Selection**: Uses regular `figure[p]` for dedicated page figures instead of `figure*[p]`
  - **Preserved Behavior**: Maintains `figure*` for textwidth figures without explicit dedicated page positioning

## [v1.5.7] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **üêõ BibTeX Manuscript Name Detection**: Fixed critical manuscript name passing issue that caused BibTeX compilation failures
  - **Root Cause**: The `write_manuscript_output` function relied on inconsistent `MANUSCRIPT_PATH` environment variable setting, leading to empty manuscript names and `.tex` filenames
  - **Systematic Solution**: Enhanced `write_manuscript_output` to accept explicit `manuscript_name` parameter with robust fallback handling
  - **Direct Name Extraction**: Modified `generate_preprint` to extract manuscript name directly from path and pass it explicitly
  - **User Impact**: Commands like `rxiv pdf CCT8_paper/` now generate `CCT8_paper.tex` correctly instead of `.tex`, resolving "BibTeX returned error code 1" errors
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Updated test suite with new function signature and verified edge case handling
- **GitHub Issues**: Resolves #100 (BibTeX error with manuscript path handling)

## [v1.5.5] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **üêõ BibTeX Error Code 1 - Trailing Slash Issue**: Fixed manuscript path handling when paths contain trailing slashes
  - **Root Cause**: When users run `rxiv pdf CCT8_paper/` (with trailing slash), `os.path.basename("CCT8_paper/")` returns empty string, causing filename validation to default to "MANUSCRIPT"
  - **Mismatch Problem**: This created a mismatch where LaTeX expected to compile `CCT8_paper.tex` but only `MANUSCRIPT.tex` was generated, causing "Emergency stop" and subsequent BibTeX error code 1
  - **Comprehensive Fix**: Added path normalization using `rstrip("/")` in both BuildManager constructor and environment variable setting to handle trailing slashes correctly
  - **Regression Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite `test_trailing_slash_regression.py` to prevent future regressions
  - **User Impact**: Users can now run `rxiv pdf manuscript_name/` (with trailing slash) without encountering BibTeX errors
- **GitHub Issues**: Resolves remaining cases of #100 (BibTeX returned error code 1) related to trailing slash paths
## [v1.5.4] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **üêõ BibTeX Error Code 1**: Fixed invalid LaTeX filename generation that caused "BibTeX returned error code 1" errors
  - **Root Cause**: When `MANUSCRIPT_PATH` environment variable was set to invalid values (empty string, ".", or ".."), the `write_manuscript_output` function would create files with invalid names like `..tex` or `.tex`
  - **LaTeX Compilation Failure**: These invalid filenames caused LaTeX to fail with "Emergency stop" errors, which subsequently caused BibTeX to fail with error code 1
  - **Robust Validation**: Added input validation to `write_manuscript_output` function to prevent invalid filenames and default to "MANUSCRIPT.tex" when necessary
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Added regression test `test_write_manuscript_output_invalid_paths` to ensure edge cases are handled correctly
  - **End-to-End Verification**: Confirmed PDF generation pipeline now works correctly with successful BibTeX processing
- **GitHub Issues**: Resolves #100 (BibTeX returned error code 1)
