# CarConnectivity Connector for Audi

A Python connector for Audi vehicles that integrates with the [CarConnectivity framework](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) by Till Steinbach, allowing you to interact with your Audi vehicle's data and controls through a standardized API.

## About CarConnectivity

This connector is built for the [CarConnectivity](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity) framework, which provides a unified interface for connecting to various car manufacturers' APIs. CarConnectivity is developed and maintained by [Till Steinbach](https://github.com/tillsteinbach).

## Features

- 🚗 **Vehicle Status**: Access battery/fuel levels, range, odometer readings
- 🔐 **Remote Control**: Lock/unlock doors, start/stop charging and climatization
- 📍 **Location Services**: Get vehicle position and parking information
- 🔧 **Maintenance**: Check inspection and service due dates
- 🌡️ **Climate Control**: Remote climate control and window heating
- 💡 **Vehicle Lights**: Monitor and control vehicle lighting
- ⚡ **Charging**: Monitor and control electric vehicle charging

## Installation

Install the connector using pip:

```bash
pip install carconnectivity-connector-audi
```

You'll also need the CarConnectivity CLI:

```bash
pip install carconnectivity-cli
```

## Configuration

### Quick Start with Template

1. Copy the provided template and customize it with your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp audi_config_template.json audi_config.json
   # Edit audi_config.json with your actual Audi credentials
   ```

2. Or create a configuration file manually (e.g., `audi_config.json`) with your Audi credentials:

```json
{
    "carConnectivity": {
        "connectors": [
            {
                "type": "audi",
                "config": {
                    "username": "your.email@example.com",
                    "password": "your_password"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Usage

### List all available resources
```bash
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json list
```

### Get vehicle state
```bash
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json get /garage/YOUR_VIN/state
```

### Get battery/fuel level
```bash
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json get /garage/YOUR_VIN/drives/primary/level
```

### Get vehicle position
```bash
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json get /garage/YOUR_VIN/position/latitude
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json get /garage/YOUR_VIN/position/longitude
```

### Control charging (for electric vehicles)
```bash
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json set /garage/YOUR_VIN/charging/commands/start-stop start
```

### Control climatization
```bash
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json set /garage/YOUR_VIN/climatization/commands/start-stop start
```

### Lock/unlock doors
```bash
carconnectivity-cli audi_config.json set /garage/YOUR_VIN/doors/commands/lock-unlock lock
```

## Running with Docker

You can run the Audi connector using Docker with the [CarConnectivity-MQTT](https://github.com/tillsteinbach/CarConnectivity-plugin-mqtt) image made by Till. This allows you to publish vehicle data to an MQTT broker for integration with home automation systems.

### Docker Compose Setup

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  carconnectivity-mqtt:
    image: "tillsteinbach/carconnectivity-mqtt:latest"
    environment:
      - ADDITIONAL_INSTALLS=carconnectivity-connector-audi
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin  # Set your timezone
    volumes:
      - ./carconnectivity.json:/carconnectivity.json
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Configuration for Docker

Create a `carconnectivity.json` configuration file:

```json
{
    "carConnectivity": {
        "log_level": "info",
        "connectors": [
            {
                "type": "audi",
                "config": {
                    "interval": 600,
                    "username": "your.email@example.com",
                    "password": "your_password"
                }
            }
        ],
        "plugins": [
            {
                "type": "mqtt",
                "config": {
                    "broker": "192.168.1.100",
                    "port": 1883,
                    "username": "mqtt_user",
                    "password": "mqtt_password"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
