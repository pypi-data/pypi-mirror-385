    A `Spec` describes the properties and types for the config of a :py:class:`Task`.

    This is the base on which task `Specs` are built. Specific `Tasks` extend this
    class to add custom attributes.

    The first word in :py:attr:`name` determines the :py:attr:`task_type`. This is
    used to identify the :py:class:`Task` in the :py:class:`otter.task.TaskRegistry`
    and in the config file.

    For example, for a ``DoSomething`` class defining a `Task`, the `task_type`
    will be ``do_something``, and in the configuration file, it could be used
    inside a `Step` like this:
