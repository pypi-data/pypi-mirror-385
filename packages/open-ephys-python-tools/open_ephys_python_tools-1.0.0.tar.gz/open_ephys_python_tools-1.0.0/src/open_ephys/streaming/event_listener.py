class EventListener:
    """
    A class that communicates with the Open Ephys Event Broadcaster plugin.

    It can be used to receive TTL events and spike times over a network
    connection.

    IMPORTANT: The Event Broadcaster must be configured to send events in
    "JSON" format.

    To use, first create an EventListener object:

        >> stream = EventListener()

    Then, define a callback function for TTL events, spikes, or both:

        >> def ttl_callback_function(event_info):
            # how should the program respond to the incoming event?

    Finally, start the stream to listen for events.

        >> stream.start(ttl_callback = ttl_callback_function)

    This will call your desired function whenever a new event is received.
