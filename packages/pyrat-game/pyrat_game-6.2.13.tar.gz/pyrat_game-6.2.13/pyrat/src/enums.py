This module contains the enumerations used in PyRat.
An enumeration is a symbolic name for a set of values, which can be used to make the code more readable and maintainable.
It is recommended to use these enumerations instead of hard-coded strings or integers to avoid errors and improve code clarity.

class Action (enum.Enum):

    """
    This enumeration defines all the possible actions a player can take in a maze.
    In the classes inheriting from ``Player``, the ``turn()`` method should return one of these actions.

    Possible actions are:
        * ``NOTHING``: No action.
        * ``NORTH``:   Move north.
        * ``SOUTH``:   Move south.

class GameMode (enum.Enum):

    """
    This enumeration defines all accepted game modes.
    The game mode defines how time is shared between players and how actions are applied.
    To set the game mode, use the ``game_mode`` parameter of the ``Game`` class.

    Possible game modes are:
        * ``MATCH``:       Players have their own process and play simultaneously, with timeouts that can be missed (default in multi-team games). \
                           In other words, each player has a limited time to make a decision, and if they do not make a decision in time, their action is set to ``Action.NOTHING`` for the turn. \
                           The durations of the preprocessing and turn phases are defined by the ``preprocessing_time`` and ``turn_time`` parameters of the ``Game`` class.
        * ``SYNCHRONOUS``: Players have their own process and play simultaneously, but actions are applied when all players have made their decision. \
                           Contrary to the ``MATCH`` mode, there is no timeout, so players can take as much time as they want to make their decision. \
                           Preprocessing and turn phases are still given a minimum duration, but they can be longer if players take more time to make their decision. \
                           This is useful for debugging, as it allows you to see the game state after each player's decision.
        * ``SEQUENTIAL``:  All players are asked for a decision, and then actions are applied simultaneously, but there is no multiprocessing (default in single-team games).
        * ``SIMULATION``:  The game is run as fast as possible, *i.e.*, there is no rendering, no multiprocessing, and no timeouts. \
                           You should use this mode when running multiple games to collect statistics, as it is the fastest mode.

    Possible skins are:

        * ``PYTHON``: The player is a python.

        * ``UNIFORM_HOLES``: Missing cells are uniformly distributed.
