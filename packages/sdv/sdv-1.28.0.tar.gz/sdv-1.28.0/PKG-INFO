# Overview

The **Synthetic Data Vault** (SDV) is a Python library designed to be your one-stop shop for
creating tabular synthetic data. The SDV uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to learn
patterns from your real data and emulate them in synthetic data.

## Features
:brain: **Create synthetic data using machine learning.** The SDV offers multiple models, ranging
from classical statistical methods (GaussianCopula) to deep learning methods (CTGAN). Generate
data for single tables, multiple connected tables or sequential tables.

:bar_chart: **Evaluate and visualize data.** Compare the synthetic data to the real data against a
variety of measures. Diagnose problems and generate a quality report to get more insights.

:arrows_counterclockwise: **Preprocess, anonymize and define constraints.** Control data
processing to improve the quality of synthetic data, choose from different types of anonymization
and define business rules in the form of logical constraints.

# Install
The SDV is publicly available under the [Business Source License](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/main/LICENSE).
Install SDV using pip or conda. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with
other software on your device.

```bash
pip install sdv
```

```bash
conda install -c pytorch -c conda-forge sdv
```

# Getting Started
Load a demo dataset to get started. This dataset is a single table describing guests staying at a
fictional hotel.

```python
from sdv.datasets.demo import download_demo

real_data, metadata = download_demo(
    modality='single_table',
    dataset_name='fake_hotel_guests')
```

![Single Table Metadata Example](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/blob/stable/docs/images/Single-Table-Metadata-Example.png)

The demo also includes **metadata**, a description of the dataset, including the data types in each
column and the primary key (`guest_email`).

## Synthesizing Data
Next, we can create an **SDV synthesizer**,  an object that you can use to create synthetic data.
It learns patterns from the real data and replicates them to generate synthetic data. Let's use
the [GaussianCopulaSynthesizer](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthesizers/gaussiancopulasynthesizer).

```python
from sdv.single_table import GaussianCopulaSynthesizer

synthesizer = GaussianCopulaSynthesizer(metadata)
synthesizer.fit(data=real_data)
```

And now the synthesizer is ready to create synthetic data!

```python
synthetic_data = synthesizer.sample(num_rows=500)
```

The synthetic data will have the following properties:
- **Sensitive columns are fully anonymized.** The email, billing address and credit card number
columns contain new data so you don't expose the real values.
- **Other columns follow statistical patterns.** For example, the proportion of room types, the
distribution of check in dates and the correlations between room rate and room type are preserved.
- **Keys and other relationships are intact.** The primary key (guest email) is unique for each row.
If you have multiple tables, the connection between a primary and foreign keys makes sense.

## Evaluating Synthetic Data
The SDV library allows you to evaluate the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data. Get
started by generating a quality report.

```python
from sdv.evaluation.single_table import evaluate_quality

quality_report = evaluate_quality(
    real_data,
    synthetic_data,
    metadata)
```

```
Generating report ...

(1/2) Evaluating Column Shapes: |████████████████| 9/9 [00:00<00:00, 1133.09it/s]|
Column Shapes Score: 89.11%

(2/2) Evaluating Column Pair Trends: |██████████████████████████████████████████| 36/36 [00:00<00:00, 502.88it/s]|
Column Pair Trends Score: 88.3%

Overall Score (Average): 88.7%
```

This object computes an overall quality score on a scale of 0 to 100% (100 being the best) as well
as detailed breakdowns. For more insights, you can also visualize the synthetic vs. real data.

```python
from sdv.evaluation.single_table import get_column_plot

fig = get_column_plot(
    real_data=real_data,
    synthetic_data=synthetic_data,
    column_name='amenities_fee',
    metadata=metadata
)
    
fig.show()
```

# What's Next?
Using the SDV library, you can synthesize single table, multi table and sequential data. You can
also customize the full synthetic data workflow, including preprocessing, anonymization and adding
constraints.

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* 🔄 Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* 🧠 Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* 📊 Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://bit.ly/sdv-docs) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.
