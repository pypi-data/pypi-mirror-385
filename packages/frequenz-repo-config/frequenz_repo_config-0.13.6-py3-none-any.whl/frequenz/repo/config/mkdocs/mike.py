"""Tools to work with mike.

This module provides these tools:

* Building the mike version information from the repository information
  ([`build_mike_version()`][frequenz.repo.config.mkdocs.mike.build_mike_version]).
* Sorting the mike version information `version.json` file
  ([`sort_mike_versions()`][frequenz.repo.config.mkdocs.mike.sort_mike_versions]).
* Comparing mike versions
  ([`compare_mike_version()`][frequenz.repo.config.mkdocs.mike.compare_mike_version]).

Mike versions have the format `vX.Y(-pre|-dev)?`, where `X` is the major version, `Y` is
the minor version, and the optional suffix is either `-pre` for pre-release versions or
`-dev` for development versions.

Stable (tagged) versions have the format `vX.Y`, unless they are pre-release versions,
then they have the format `vX.Y-pre`. Develoment branches have the format `vX.Y-dev`.

* Tag `v1.0.0` -> `v1.0`
* Tag `v2.1.0-alpha.1` -> `v2.1-pre`
* Branch `v1.x.x` (with no releases) -> `v1.0-dev`
* Branch `v1.x.x (with releases an existing release, for example `v1.0.0`) -> `v1.1-dev`
* Branch `v1.1.x` -> `v1.1-dev`

Aliases have the format `vX(-pre|-dev)?`, where `X` is the major version and the
optional suffix is either `-pre` for pre-release versions or `-dev` for development
versions. An alias is also provided to point to the latest version, which is `latest`
for stable versions, `latest-pre` for pre-release versions, and `latest-dev` for
development versions.
