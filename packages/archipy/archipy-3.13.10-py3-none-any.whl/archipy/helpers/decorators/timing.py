    """A decorator that measures the execution time of a function and logs it if the logging level is DEBUG.

    Args:
        func (Callable): The function to be decorated.

    Returns:
        Callable: The wrapped function which logs the execution time if the logging level is DEBUG.

    Example:
        To use this decorator, simply apply it to any function. For example:

        ```python
        @timing_decorator
        def example_function(n: int) -> str:
            time.sleep(n)
            return f"Slept for {n} seconds"

        result = example_function(2)
        ```

        Output (if logging level is DEBUG):
        ```
        2023-10-10 12:00:00,000 - DEBUG - example_function took 2.0001 seconds to execute.
        Slept for 2 seconds
        ```
