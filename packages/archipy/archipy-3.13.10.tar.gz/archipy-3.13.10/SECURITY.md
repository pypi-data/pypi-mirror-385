## Security Recommendations

When using ArchiPy in your projects, we recommend:

1. Always use the latest version with security updates
2. Set appropriate rate limits for APIs
3. Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. Keep your dependencies updated regularly
5. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
6. Apply the principle of least privilege for database connections

## Disclosure Policy

When security vulnerabilities are reported, we follow this disclosure process:

1. Confirm the vulnerability and determine its scope
2. Develop and test a fix
3. Release a patch for the vulnerability
4. Announce the vulnerability (without specific exploit details) and credit the reporter (if desired)

## Security Update Process

Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1 â†’ 0.1.2) and are announced through:

- GitHub releases
- Release notes in the project documentation
- Communications to users who have opted in for security notifications

## Third-Party Dependencies

ArchiPy relies on several third-party packages. We regularly monitor:

- Security advisories for dependencies
- CVE databases for relevant vulnerabilities
- Updates and patches for all dependencies

We recommend users regularly run `poetry update` to ensure they have the latest secure versions of all dependencies.
