3. **Write code and tests** for your feature or fix
4. **Ensure all tests pass** and code meets quality standards
5. **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`
6. **Push to your branch**: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of the changes

### Documentation Improvements

Documentation is crucial for user experience. You can help by:

1. Fixing typos or clarifying existing documentation
2. Adding examples or use cases

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.13+**
- **UV** (dependency management)
- **Git**
- **make** (for running development commands)

### Setup Process

1. **Fork and clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ArchiPy.git
   cd ArchiPy
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   # Set up project pre-requisites (installs UV)
   make setup

   # Install development dependencies
   make install-dev
   ```

3. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```

### Useful Commands

ArchiPy provides commands via a Makefile to simplify development:

#### Environment Management

```bash
# Install core dependencies
make install

# Install development dependencies (including all extras)
make install-dev

# Update dependencies to their latest versions
make update
```

#### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with black
make format

# Run all linters (ruff, mypy)
make lint

# Run pre-commit hooks on all files
make pre-commit

# Run all checks (linting and tests)
make check
```

#### Testing

```bash
# Run BDD tests with behave
make behave
```

#### Building and Versioning

```bash
# Clean artifacts
make clean

# Build project distribution
make build

# Display current version
make version

# Bump versions
make bump-patch    # Bug fixes
make bump-minor    # New features
make bump-major    # Breaking changes
```

For a complete list:

```bash
make help
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code passes all checks**: Run `make check` locally
2. **Update documentation** if necessary
3. **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes
4. **Ensure compatibility** with Python 3.13+
5. **Verify all CI checks pass** on your PR

Pull requests are typically reviewed within a few days. Maintainers may request changes or clarifications about your
implementation.

## Versioning Guidelines

ArchiPy follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch** (`make bump-patch`): Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Minor** (`make bump-minor`): New features (backward compatible)
- **Major** (`make bump-major`): Breaking changes
