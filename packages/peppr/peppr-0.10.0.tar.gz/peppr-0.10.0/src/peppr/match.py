    Match the atoms from the given reference and pose structure so that the RMSD between
    them is minimized.

    'Matching' has two effects here:

    - Chains and atoms within each residue *that have a counterpart* in the respective
      other structure, are reordered if necessary so that they are in the same order.
    - A ``matched`` annotation is added, which is ``False`` for all atoms, that
      *do not have a counterpart*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : AtomArray, shape=(p,)
        The reference structure.
    pose : AtomArray, shape=(q,)
        The pose structure.
    min_sequence_identity : float, optional
        The minimum sequence identity between two chains to be considered the same
        entity.
    use_heuristic : bool or int, optional
        Whether to employ a fast heuristic [1]_ to find the optimal chain permutation.
        This heuristic represents each chain by its centroid, i.e. instead of
        exhaustively superimposing all atoms for each permutation, only the centroids
        are superimposed and the closest match between the reference and pose is
        selected.
    max_matches : int, optional
        The maximum number of atom mappings to try, if the `use_heuristic` is set to
        ``False``.
    allow_unmatched_entities : bool, optional
        If set to ``True``, allow entire entities to be unmatched.
        This is useful if a pose is compared to a reference which may contain different
        molecules.
    use_entity_annotation : bool, optional
        If set to ``True``, use the ``entity_id`` annotation to determine which chains
        are the same entity and therefore are mappable to each other.
        By default, the entity is determined from sequence identity for polymers and
        residue name for small molecules.

    Returns
    -------
    matched_reference, matched_pose : AtomArray, shape=(p,) or (q,)
        The input atoms, where the chains and atoms within each residue are brought into
        the corresponding order.
        Atoms that are matched between the reference and the pose are annotated with
        ``matched=True``.
        All other atoms are annotated with ``matched=False``.
        This means indexing both structures with ``matched`` as boolean mask will return
        structures with the same number of atoms.

    Notes
    -----
    Atoms that are not matched (``matched=False``), are positioned in the reordered
    return value as follows:

    - Unmatched chains are appended to the end.
    - Unmatched residues within a matched chain are kept at their original sequence
      position.
    - Unmatched atoms within a matched residue are kept at their original position.

    Note that the heuristic used by default is much faster compared to the
    exhaustive approach:
    Especially for larger complexes with many homomers or small molecule copies,
    the number of possible mappings combinatorially explodes.
    However, the heuristic might not find the optimal permutation for all cases,
    especially in poses that only remotely resemble the reference.
