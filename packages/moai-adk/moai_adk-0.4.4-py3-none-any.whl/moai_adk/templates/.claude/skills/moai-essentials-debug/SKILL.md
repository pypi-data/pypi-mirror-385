# Alfred Debugger Pro

## Skill Metadata
| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Allowed tools | Read (read_file), Write (write_file), Edit (edit_file), Bash (terminal), TodoWrite (todo_write) |
| Auto-load | On demand during Run stage (debug-helper) |
| Trigger cues | Runtime error triage, stack trace analysis, root cause investigation requests. |

## What it does

Advanced debugging support with stack trace analysis, common error pattern detection, and actionable fix suggestions.

## When to use

- Loads when users share stack traces or ask why a failure occurred.
- ‚ÄúResolve the error‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is the cause of this error?‚Äù, ‚ÄúStack trace analysis‚Äù
- Automatically invoked on runtime errors (via debug-helper sub-agent)
- "Why not?", "Solving NullPointerException"

## How it works

**Stack Trace Analysis**:
```python
# Error example
jwt.exceptions.ExpiredSignatureError: Signature has expired

# Alfred Analysis
üìç Error Location: src/auth/service.py:142
üîç Root Cause: JWT token has expired
üí° Fix Suggestion:
   1. Implement token refresh logic
   2. Check expiration before validation
   3. Handle ExpiredSignatureError gracefully
```

**Common Error Patterns**:
- `NullPointerException` ‚Üí Optional usage, guard clauses
- `IndexError` ‚Üí Boundary checks
- `KeyError` ‚Üí `.get()` with defaults
- `TypeError` ‚Üí Type hints, input validation
- `ConnectionError` ‚Üí Retry logic, timeouts

**Debugging Checklist**:
- [ ] Reproducible?
- [ ] Log messages?
- [ ] Input data?
- [ ] Recent changes?
- [ ] Dependency versions?

**Language-specific Tips**:
- **Python**: Logging, type guards
- **TypeScript**: Type guards, null checks
- **Java**: Optional, try-with-resources

## Examples
```markdown
- Checks the current diff and lists items that can be modified immediately.
- Schedule follow-up tasks with TodoWrite.
```

## Inputs
- A snapshot of the code/tests/documentation you are currently working on.
- Ongoing agent status information.

## Outputs
- Immediately actionable checklists or improvement suggestions.
- Recommendations on whether to take next steps or not.

## Failure Modes
- If you cannot find the required files or test results.
- When the scope of work is excessively large and cannot be resolved with simple support.

## Dependencies
- Mainly used in conjunction with `tdd-implementer`, `quality-gate`, etc.

- 2025-03-29: Overhauled input/output definitions for Essentials skills.

## Works well with

- moai-essentials-refactor

## Best Practices
- Record results, even for simple improvements, to increase traceability.
- Clearly mark items that require human review to distinguish them from automation.
