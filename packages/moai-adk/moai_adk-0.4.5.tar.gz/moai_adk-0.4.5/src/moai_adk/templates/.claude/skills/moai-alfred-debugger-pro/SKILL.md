# Alfred Debugger Pro

## Skill Metadata
| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Allowed tools | Read (read_file), Write (write_file), Edit (edit_file), Bash (terminal), TodoWrite (todo_write) |
| Auto-load | Triggered by Alfred debug-helper |
| Trigger cues | Runtime failures surfaced in Alfred runs, stack trace walkthroughs, hotfix triage. |

## What it does

Advanced debugging support with stack trace analysis, common error pattern detection, and actionable fix suggestions.

## When to use

- Activates when Alfred encounters runtime errors and needs guided debugging steps.
- ‚ÄúResolve the error‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is the cause of this error?‚Äù, ‚ÄúStack trace analysis‚Äù
- Automatically invoked on runtime errors (via debug-helper sub-agent)
- "Why not?", "Solving NullPointerException"

## How it works

**Stack Trace Analysis**:
```python
# Error example
jwt.exceptions.ExpiredSignatureError: Signature has expired

# Alfred Analysis
üìç Error Location: src/auth/service.py:142
üîç Root Cause: JWT token has expired
üí° Fix Suggestion:
   1. Implement token refresh logic
   2. Check expiration before validation
   3. Handle ExpiredSignatureError gracefully
```

**Common Error Patterns**:
- `NullPointerException` ‚Üí Optional usage, guard clauses
- `IndexError` ‚Üí Boundary checks
- `KeyError` ‚Üí `.get()` with defaults
- `TypeError` ‚Üí Type hints, input validation
- `ConnectionError` ‚Üí Retry logic, timeouts

**Debugging Checklist**:
- [ ] Reproducible?
- [ ] Log messages?
- [ ] Input data?
- [ ] Recent changes?
- [ ] Dependency versions?

**Language-specific Tips**:
- **Python**: Logging, type guards
- **TypeScript**: Type guards, null checks
- **Java**: Optional, try-with-resources

## Best Practices
- The text shown to the user is written using TUI/report expressions.
- When running the tool, a summary of commands and results are recorded.

## Examples
```markdown
- Call this skill inside the /alfred command to generate a report.
- Add summary to Completion Report.
```

## Inputs
- MoAI-ADK project context (`.moai/project/`, `.claude/` templates, etc.).
- Parameters passed from user commands or higher commands.

## Outputs
- Reports, checklists or recommendations for your Alfred workflow.
- Structured data for subsequent subagent calls.

## Failure Modes
- When required input documents are missing or permissions are limited.
- When disruptive changes are required without user approval.

## Dependencies
- Cooperation with higher-level agents such as cc-manager and project-manager is required.
