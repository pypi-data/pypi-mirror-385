    The model contains the total amount of carbon emissions generated by the shipment. - AfterShip will provide this data only when it is available, and its availability is contingent upon the location and weight information that AfterShip can obtain.- The values will be accessible solely for shipments that have been successfully delivered. However, in the event of a shipping update after the delivery status has been achieved, the value may change.- Itâ€™s a paid service and only for Tracking Enterprise users, please contact your customer success manager if you want to know more.
