README.md - User-Focused Introduction

PURPOSE: This file serves as the first contact point for users, developers, and evaluators visiting the QuickScale project.

CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Keep content user-facing and accessible to newcomers
- Focus on "what" and "how to get started" rather than "why" or technical details  
- Include quick examples and development workflows
- Avoid deep architectural explanations (those belong in DECISIONS.md)
- Avoid competitive analysis or strategic context (those belong in QUICKSCALE.md)
- Maximum length: ~200 lines to ensure quick readability
- Link to other documents for detailed information

TARGET AUDIENCE: New users, potential adopters, GitHub visitors, developers evaluating QuickScale

## QuickScale: Compose your Django SaaS.

QuickScale is a **composable Django framework** for building client SaaS applications. Start with a stable core, add reusable modules, customize themes, and deploy faster‚Äîwhile maintaining the flexibility to create commercial extensions and build a community ecosystem.

---

## What is QuickScale?

QuickScale is a **composable Django framework** designed for **solo developers and development agencies** who build multiple client SaaS applications. It provides a stable foundation with reusable components, enabling you to:

- **Build once, reuse everywhere**: Create modules and themes that work across all your client projects
- **Maintain commercial flexibility**: Keep core components open source while offering premium modules/themes via subscriptions
- **Scale your development business**: Standardize your tech stack and accelerate client project delivery
- **Build a community ecosystem**: Share and monetize your extensions while benefiting from community contributions

üß≠ **Evolution Snapshot**: QuickScale intentionally ships as a personal toolkit today and only grows into a community platform when real demand emerges. Catch the full story in the [evolution overview](./docs/overview/quickscale.md#evolution-strategy-personal-toolkit-first).

## Documentation Guide

**Start here for your needs:**
- üìñ **New user?** You're in the right place. This README shows you what QuickScale is and how to get started.
- üîß **Need commands?** See [user_manual.md](./docs/technical/user_manual.md) for all commands and workflows
- üöÄ **Deploying to Railway?** See [railway.md](./docs/deployment/railway.md) for Railway deployment guide
- üìã **Planning a feature?** Check [decisions.md](./docs/technical/decisions.md) for the authoritative MVP scope and technical rules
- üóìÔ∏è **Timeline & tasks?** See [roadmap.md](./docs/technical/roadmap.md)
- üèóÔ∏è **Project structure?** See [scaffolding.md](./docs/technical/scaffolding.md) for complete directory layouts
- üéØ **Why QuickScale?** See [quickscale.md](./docs/overview/quickscale.md) for competitive positioning

**Quick Reference:**
- **MVP** = Phase 1 (Personal Toolkit)
- **Post-MVP** = Phase 2+ (Modules & Themes)
- **Generated Project** = Output of `quickscale init`

See [decisions.md - Glossary section](./docs/technical/decisions.md#document-responsibilities-short) for complete terminology and Single Source of Truth reference


### Primary Use Cases:
- **Solo Developer**: Build client projects faster with reusable components you maintain
- **Development Agency**: Standardize your tech stack across multiple client engagements  
- **Commercial Extension Developer**: Create and sell premium modules/themes
- **Open Source Contributor**: Extend the ecosystem with new modules and themes

### Development Flow (MVP)
1. `quickscale init myapp`
  - Generates the minimal Django starter described in the MVP Feature Matrix
  - Ships with standalone `settings.py` by default; there is NO automatic settings inheritance. Advanced users who manually embed `quickscale_core` via git subtree may opt-in to inherit from `quickscale_core.settings` (see [decisions.md](./docs/technical/decisions.md#mvp-feature-matrix-authoritative)).
  - **Optional**: Embed `quickscale_core` via git subtree after generation; follow the [Personal Toolkit workflow](./docs/technical/decisions.md#integration-note-personal-toolkit-git-subtree) for canonical commands and helper roadmap
2. Add your custom Django apps and features
3. Adopt optional inheritance or module extraction patterns only when you embed the core; the rules and best practices stay centralized in `DECISIONS.md`
4. Build your unique client application
5. Deploy using standard Django deployment patterns

‚ÑπÔ∏è QuickScale's MVP centers on the personal toolkit workflow. Extraction patterns, module packaging, and subtree helper command plans stay documented in `docs/technical/decisions.md` so this README can stay concise.

üîé **Scope note**: The [MVP Feature Matrix](./docs/technical/decisions.md#mvp-feature-matrix-authoritative) is the single source of truth for what's in or out.

### What You Get

Running `quickscale init myapp` generates a **production-ready Django project** with:

- ‚úÖ **Docker** setup (development + production)
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL** configuration
- ‚úÖ **Environment-based** settings (dev/prod split)
- ‚úÖ **Security** best practices (SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Testing** infrastructure (pytest + factory_boy)
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD** pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ‚úÖ **Code quality** hooks (ruff format + ruff check)
- ‚úÖ **Poetry** for dependency management

**See the complete project structure:** [scaffolding.md - Generated Project Output](./docs/technical/scaffolding.md#5-generated-project-output)

The generated project is **yours to own and modify** - no vendor lock-in, just Django best practices.

## Why QuickScale?

‚úÖ **Production-ready from day one** - Docker, PostgreSQL, pytest, CI/CD, security best practices
‚úÖ **Built on Django** - No magic, just excellent Django patterns and battle-tested packages
‚úÖ **Shared improvements** - Security fixes and updates flow across all your projects via git subtree
‚úÖ **Full ownership** - Generated projects are 100% yours, no vendor lock-in

**QuickScale is a development accelerator**, not a complete solution. You start with production-ready foundations and build your unique client application on top.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install QuickScale globally
./scripts/install_global.sh

```

**That's it!** Visit http://localhost:8000 to see your new Django project.

### Development Workflow with Docker

QuickScale includes convenient CLI commands for Docker-based development:

```bash
# Start all services (web + database)
quickscale up

# View logs
quickscale logs -f web

# Run Django commands
quickscale manage migrate
quickscale manage createsuperuser

# Open a shell in the container
quickscale shell
