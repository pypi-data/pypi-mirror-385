# Zino â†” Argus glue service

This is a [glue
service](https://argus-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integrations/glue-services/index.html)
for integration between [Argus](https://github.com/Uninett/Argus), the alert
aggregation server, and [Zino](https://github.com/Uninett/zino), the network
state monitor provided by Sikt.

This is still a work in progress and more information will be added here later.

## Configuring zino-argus-glue

The `zino-argus-glue` program needs to know how to connect to both a Zino API
server and an Argus API server in order to synchronize incidents from Zino to
Argus.  Addresses and authentication tokens for these APIs are configured in
`zinoargus.toml`.  `zinoargus` reads this file the current working directory,
or you can specify an alternate path to a configuration file using the `-c`
command line option.  See [zinoargus.toml.example](./zinoargus.toml.example)
for an example configuration file.
