For more information about authentication, see [the Toast Developer Guide](https://doc.toasttab.com/doc/devguide/authentication.html).  ## Menus API  Returns information about a restaurant's menus.  _Important:_ Ordering integrations should use menus API V3. Other integration types should continue to use menus API V2 until further notice. See <a href=\"https://doc.toasttab.com/doc/devguide/apiComparingMenusAPIV2AndV3.html\">Comparing menus API V2 and V3</a> for more information.  ## Orders API  The orders API includes operations that create, update, and retrieve information about restaurant guest orders.  Information on orders includes the checks, items ordered, prices, payments, discounts, and customer data.  You can create a new order. The orders API includes an operation to retrieve the order prices before you `POST` the order.  You can add items to an existing check.
