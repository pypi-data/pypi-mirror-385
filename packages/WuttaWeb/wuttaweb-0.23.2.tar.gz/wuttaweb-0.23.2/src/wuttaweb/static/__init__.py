Static Assets

Note that (for now?) It is assumed that *all* (i.e. even custom) apps
will include this module somewhere during startup.  For instance this
happens within :func:`wuttaweb.app.main()`::

   pyramid_config.include('wuttaweb.static')

This allows for certain common assets to be available for all apps.

However, an attempt is being made to incorporate Fanstatic for use
with the built-in static assets.  It is possible the above mechanism
could be abandoned in the future.

So on the Fanstatic front, we currently have defined:

.. data:: img

   A :class:`fanstatic:fanstatic.Library` representing the ``img``
   static folder.

.. data:: favicon

   A :class:`fanstatic:fanstatic.Resource` representing the
   ``img/favicon.ico`` image file.

.. data:: logo

   A :class:`fanstatic:fanstatic.Resource` representing the
   ``img/logo.png`` image file.

.. data:: testing

   A :class:`fanstatic:fanstatic.Resource` representing the
   ``img/testing.png`` image file.
"""

from fanstatic import Library, Resource


# fanstatic img library
img = Library("wuttaweb_img", "img")
favicon = Resource(img, "favicon.ico")
# nb. mock out the renderers here, to appease fanstatic
logo = Resource(img, "logo.png", renderer=True)
testing = Resource(img, "testing.png", renderer=True)


# TODO: should consider deprecating this?
def includeme(config):  # pylint: disable=missing-function-docstring
    config.add_static_view("wuttaweb", "wuttaweb:static")
