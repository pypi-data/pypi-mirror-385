Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Some features of Postman include:

* API repository -  Easily store, catalog and collaborate your APIs in a central platform.
* Tools - Includes a set of tools that helps accelerate the API lifecyle from design, testing, documenting and sharing of APIs
* Workspaces - Helps organise your APIs and collaborate with teams across your organisation. 

Developers widely use Postman to simplify the process of testing APIs by providing a user-friendly interface for making requests, viewing responses and debugging issues.
