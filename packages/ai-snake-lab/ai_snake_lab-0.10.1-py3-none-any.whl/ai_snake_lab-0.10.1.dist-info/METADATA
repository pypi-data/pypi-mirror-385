# 🐍 AI Snake Lab

---

![AI Snake Lab](/images/ai-snake-lab.png)
# 📝 Introduction

**AI Snake Lab** is an interactive reinforcement learning sandbox for experimenting with AI agents in a classic Snake Game environment — featuring a live Textual TUI interface, flexible replay memory database, and modular model definitions.

---

# 🚀 Features

- 🐍 **Classic Snake environment** with customizable grid and rules
- 🧠 **AI agent interface** supporting multiple architectures (Linear, RNN, CNN)
- 🎮 **Textual-based simulator** for live visualization and metrics
- 💾 **SQLite-backed replay memory** for storing frames, episodes, and runs
- 🧩 **Experiment metadata tracking** — models, hyperparameters, state-map versions
- 📊 **Built-in plotting** for hashrate, scores, and learning progress

---

# 🧰 Tech Stack

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Python 3.11+** | Core language |
| **Textual** | Terminal UI framework |
| **SQLite3** | Lightweight replay memory + experiment store |
| **PyTorch** *(optional)* | Deep learning backend for models |
| **Plotext / Matplotlib** | Visualization tools |

# 🔄 Dynamic Training

The *Dynamic Training* checkbox implements an increasing amount of *long training* that is executed at the end of each *epoch*. The `AIAgent:train_long_memory()` code is run an increasing number of times at the end of each epoch as the total number of epochs increases to a maximum of `MAX_ADAPTIVE_TRAINING_LOOPS`, which is currently `16` according to the calculation shown below:

```
    if self.dynamic_training():
        loops = max(
            1, min(self.epoch() // 250, DAIAgent.MAX_DYNAMIC_TRAINING_LOOPS)
        )
    else:
        loops = 1

    while loops > 0:
        loops -= 1
        self.train_long_memory()
```

# 🧩 Epsilon N

The *Epsilon N* class, inspired by Richard Sutton's [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html), is a drop-in replacement for the traditional *Epsilon Greedy* algorithm. It instantiates a traditional *Epsilon Greedy* instance for each score. For example, when the AI has a score of 7, an *Epsilon Greedy* instance at `self._epsilons[7]` is used.

The screenshot below shows the *Highscores* plot with the traditional, single instance *Epsilon Greedy* algorithm and with [Dynamic Training](#dynamic-training) enabled. The single-instance epsilon algorithm quickly converges but shows uneven progress. The abrupt jumps in the high score line indicate that exploration declines before the AI fully masters each stage of play.

The next screenshot shows the *Highscores* plot without [Dynamic Training](#dynamic-training) enabled and with the *Epsilon N* being used. By maintaining a separate epsilon for each score level, *Epsilon N* sustains exploration locally. This results in a smoother, more linear high-score curve as the AI consolidates learning at each stage before progressing.

As shown above, the traditional Epsilon Greedy approach leads to slower improvement, with the highscore curve flattening early. By contrast, Epsilon N maintains steady progress as the AI masters each score level independently.

# 💻 Installation

This project is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ai-snake-lab/). You can install the *AI Snake Lab* software using `pip`.

## Create a Sandbox 

```shell
python3 -m venv snake_venv
. snake_venv/bin/activate
```

## Install the AI Snake Lab

After you have activated your *venv* environment:

```shell
pip install ai-snake-lab
```

---

# ▶️ Running the AI Snake Lab

From within your *venv* environment:

```shell
ai-snake-lab
```

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

Because the simulation runs in a Textual TUI, terminal resizing and plot redraws can subtly affect the simulation timing. As a result, highscore achievements may appear at slightly different game numbers across runs. This behavior is expected and does not indicate a bug in the AI logic.

If you have a requirement to make simulation runs repeatable, drop me a note and I can implement a **headless mode** where the simulation runs in a separate process outside of Textual.

# 🙏 Acknowledgements

The original code for this project was based on a YouTube tutorial, [Python + PyTorch + Pygame Reinforcement Learning – Train an AI to Play Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds) by Patrick Loeber. You can access his original code [here](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch) on GitHub. Thank you Patrick!!! You are amazing!!!! This project is a port of the pygame and matplotlib solution.

Thanks also go out to Will McGugan and the [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) team. Textual is an amazing framework. Talk about *Rapid Application Development*. Porting this from a Pygame and MatPlotLib solution to Textual took less than a day.

# 🌟 Inspiration

Creating an artificial intelligence agent, letting it loose and watching how it performs is an amazing process. It's not unlike having children, except on a much, much, much smaller scale, at least today! Watching the AI driven Snake Game is mesmerizing. I'm constantly thinking of ways I could improve it. I credit Patrick Loeber for giving me a fun project to explore the AI space.

Much of my career has been as a Linux Systems administrator. My comfort zone is on the command line. I've never worked as a programmer and certainly not as a front end developer. [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), as a framework for building rich *Terminal User Interfaces* is exactly my speed and when I saw [Dolphie](https://github.com/charles-001/dolphie), I was blown away. Built-in, real-time plots of MySQL metrics: Amazing! 

Richard S. Sutton is also an inspiration to me. His thoughts on *Reinforcement Learning* are a slow motion revolution. His criticisms of the existing AI landscape with it's focus on engineering a specific AI to do a specific task and then considering the job done is spot on. His vision for an AI agent that does continuous, non-linear learning remains the next frontier on the path to *General Artificial Intelligence*.
