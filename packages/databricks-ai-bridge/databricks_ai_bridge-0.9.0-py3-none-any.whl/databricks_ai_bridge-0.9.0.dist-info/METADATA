# Databricks AI Bridge library

The Databricks AI Bridge library provides a shared layer of APIs to interact with Databricks AI features, such as [Databricks AI/BI Genie ](https://www.databricks.com/product/ai-bi/genie) and [Vector Search](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/vector-search.html). Use these packages to help [author agents with Agent Framework](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/author-agent#requirements) on Databricks.

## Integration Packages

If you are using LangChain/LangGraph or the OpenAI SDK, we provide these integration packages for seamless integration of Databricks AI features.

- [`databricks-langchain`](./integrations/langchain/README.md) - For LangChain/LangGraph users
- [`databricks-openai`](./integrations/openai/README.md) - For OpenAI SDK users

## Installation

If you're using LangChain/LangGraph or OpenAI:

```sh
pip install databricks-langchain
pip install databricks-openai
```

For frameworks without dedicated integration packages:

```sh
