"""Trigger rules for alert channel selection and filtering.

This module defines the trigger rules system that determines which channels
should receive specific alerts based on flexible rule conditions.

The trigger system supports composable rule evaluation with various criteria
to enable sophisticated alert trigger logic using the same pattern as
transform functions.
