"""Alert trigger rules for flexible condition evaluation.

This module contains the rule-based system for alert triggers, providing
a flexible way to define conditions that determine when alerts should fire.

The rule system follows the same pattern as transform functions, with
abstract base classes, registries, and concrete implementations.
