"""Data models for loading operations in the ingestion framework.

This module defines the data models and configuration structures used for
representing data loading operations. It includes:

- Enums for representing loading methods, modes, and formats
- Data classes for structuring loading configuration
- Utility methods for parsing and validating loading parameters
- Constants for standard configuration keys

These models serve as the configuration schema for the Load components
and provide a type-safe interface between configuration and implementation.
