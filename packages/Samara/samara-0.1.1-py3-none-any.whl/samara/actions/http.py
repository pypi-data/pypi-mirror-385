"""HTTP action for executing HTTP requests in ETL pipelines.

This module implements the HTTP action that allows ETL jobs to make
HTTP requests as part of their execution flow. It supports custom headers,
different HTTP methods, and configurable timeouts and failure handling.

The HttpAction follows the Samara framework patterns for configuration-driven
initialization and implements the ActionBase interface.
