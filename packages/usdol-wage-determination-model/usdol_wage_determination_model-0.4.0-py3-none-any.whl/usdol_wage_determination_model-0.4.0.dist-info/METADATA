## To-Do

* Model adjustments
  * Job: add ID and perhaps an enumeration / taxonomy (US-wide or state specific?)
    * include level of journeyworker / apprentice / other?
  * Wage: taxonomy for pay types (regular, overtime, double-time, hazard), validations
  * Determination: validation for rate identifier and other fields
    * survey date before publication date
    * effective dates relation to publication date?
  * Location: Validation of state (and maybe county?), also add county identifier
  * All: descriptions
* Add docstrings and then enable "D" checks in ruff
* Publish code on GitHub publicly (add link in pyproject.toml)
* Add CI/CD in GitHub Actions using https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
