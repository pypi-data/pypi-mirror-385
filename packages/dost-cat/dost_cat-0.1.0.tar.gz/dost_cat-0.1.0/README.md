🔍 DoS (Denial of Service)
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of cyberattack that aims to make a system, service, or network unavailable by overwhelming it with excessive requests or resource consumption.

🚀 Features
- Targets availability of a service (not confidentiality or integrity).
- Works by flooding traffic or exhausting system resources.
- Can be performed in different layers (network, application).
- Distributed version (DDoS) uses many machines at once.

🧠 How It Works
- The attacker sends more requests than the system can handle.
- The server spends all resources responding to fake traffic.
- Legitimate users cannot access the service → it becomes “denied.”

⚠️ Disclaimer
This explanation is provided solely for educational and awareness purposes.
- DoS attacks are illegal if performed without explicit permission.
- They can cause financial, legal, and reputational damage.
- The responsibility lies entirely with the user to act ethically and legally.
By learning about DoS, you agree to use this knowledge only for defensive, testing, or research purposes (e.g., in a controlled lab environment).

🛡️ Defensive Measures
- Rate limiting: Restricting requests per second.
- Firewalls & IDS/IPS: Filtering malicious traffic.
- Load balancing: Distributing requests across servers.
- Cloud-based DDoS protection: Specialized mitigation services.

📘 Summary:
DoS is not about “hacking into” a system, but about overwhelming it so it cannot serve real users. Understanding it helps developers and sysadmins design resilient, fault-tolerant systems.
