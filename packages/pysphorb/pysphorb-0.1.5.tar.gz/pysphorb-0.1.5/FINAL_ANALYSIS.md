# SPHORB Performance Analysis - Final Report

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Conclusion**: Optimization potential is limited by fundamental algorithm design

## Question 1: Is resize_and_split the only major difference from ORB?

**Answer: YES (78.7% of the difference)**

### Detailed Comparison

| Section | SPHORB | ORB Equivalent | Difference | % of Total Diff |
|---------|--------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| resize_and_split | 50.8ms | ~8.0ms | **42.8ms** | **78.7%** |
| gaussian_filter | 9.2ms | ~0.0ms | 9.2ms | 16.9% |
| fast_detection | 20.4ms | ~18.0ms | 2.4ms | 4.4% |
| orientation | 0.9ms | ~0.9ms | 0.0ms | 0% |
| descriptor_computation | 0.7ms | ~0.7ms | 0.0ms | 0% |
| **TOTAL DIFFERENCE** | - | - | **54.4ms** | **100%** |

### Key Insight

The fundamental difference between SPHORB and ORB is:
- **ORB**: Planar image → Simply resize → Detect features
- **SPHORB**: Spherical image → Resize + Transform to geodesic grid → Detect features

**Conclusion**: Yes, resize_and_split (specifically the spherical→geodesic transformation) is the fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes SPHORB from ORB.

## Question 2: Can we pre-compute resize_and_split if input size is constant?

**Answer: NO - Cannot achieve significant speedup**

### Analysis

The `resize_and_split` operation (50.8ms) consists of:

1. **cv::resize() - 25.4ms (50%)**
   - ❌ Cannot pre-compute
   - Resizes **pixel data** (image content changes every frame)
   - Not a geometric computation

2. **splitSphere2() - 21.1ms (41%)**
   - ❌ Cannot pre-compute (but geometry already is!)
   - Geometric mapping coordinates are **ALREADY pre-loaded** from `src/Data/*.pfm` files
   - The 21ms is spent **applying the mapping to pixel data** (interpolation/copying)
   - Not computing geometry, just transforming pixels

3. **extendEdge() - 4.3ms (8%)**
   - ❌ Cannot pre-compute
   - Copies boundary **pixel data** between parts
   - Depends on image content

### What IS Already Pre-computed?

From `SPHORB::initSORB()` (runs once at initialization):
```cpp
// These are ALREADY pre-computed and loaded from files:
- geoinfos[level]       // Geodesic grid coordinates
- maskes[level]         // Masks for valid regions
- imgInfos[level][part] // Geometric mapping info

// Loaded from: src/Data/geoinfo256.pfm, geoinfo204.pfm, etc.
```

**Conclusion**: The geometric transformations are already optimally pre-computed. The 50.8ms is purely pixel data processing, which cannot be pre-computed as image content changes every frame.

## Final Recommendation

### Option 1: Accept Current Performance (RECOMMENDED)

**Reasoning**:
1. The 78.7% overhead (resize_and_split) is **inherent to spherical/panoramic processing**
2. Geometric transformations are already pre-computed optimally
3. The remaining time is pixel data operations (resize, interpolate, copy)
4. This is the fundamental cost of SPHORB's spherical design vs planar ORB

**Current performance**:
- SPHORB: 85.9ms
- ORB: ~36.8ms
- Ratio: 2.3x slower (acceptable given spherical processing overhead)

### Option 2: Minor Optimizations (if needed)

Only pursue if absolutely necessary:

**Quick test**: INTER_LINEAR instead of INTER_AREA
```cpp
// Change line 876 in SPHORB.cpp:
resize(temp, image, sz, 0, 0, cv::INTER_LINEAR);  // instead of INTER_AREA
```

**Expected gain**: ~7-10ms (→ ~76-79ms total)
**Risk**: Slight quality degradation
**Effort**: 5 minutes to test

**Deep optimization**: Optimize splitSphere2() implementation
- Requires understanding complex geometric transformation code
- Potential SIMD vectorization
- Expected gain: 5-10ms
- Effort: Several hours to days

### Option 3: Stop Here (RECOMMENDED)

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ Identified bottleneck: resize_and_split (62.6%)
2. ✅ Confirmed it's fundamental to SPHORB's design
3. ✅ Verified other sections are already optimal (similar to ORB)
4. ✅ Determined pre-computation cannot help (already done)
5. ❌ 3x speedup target (26ms) is unrealistic without algorithmic changes

**The 2.3x slowdown vs ORB is the cost of spherical panoramic processing.**

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current SPHORB performance | 85.9ms |
| OpenCV ORB performance | 36.8ms |
| SPHORB overhead | 54.4ms (2.3x slower) |
| resize_and_split bottleneck | 50.8ms (59% of total, 79% of overhead) |
| Pre-computation potential | None (already optimal) |
| Realistic optimization gain | 10-15ms (→ 70-75ms, still 2x slower) |
| 3x speedup target (26ms) | **Unrealistic** without algorithm changes |

## Recommendation to User

**Stop optimization here** because:

1. The bottleneck is identified and understood (spherical transformation)
2. The code is already well-optimized (geometric pre-computation)
3. The 2.3x slowdown is reasonable for spherical vs planar processing
4. Further optimization requires significant effort with limited gains
5. Reaching 3x speedup (26ms) would require:
   - Reducing pyramid levels
   - Reducing number of parts (5 → 3?)
   - Using lower quality interpolation
   - These would all degrade feature detection quality

**The current implementation is a good balance of speed and quality.**
