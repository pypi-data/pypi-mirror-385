## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### **1. New Module: Document Analyzer** (`modules/document_analyzer.py`)

Created comprehensive document analysis engine with 500+ lines of code:

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Domain Detection:** Identifies 6 domains (medical, legal, technical, patent, marketing, financial)
- ✅ **Terminology Extraction:** Finds capitalized terms, acronyms, technical vocabulary
- ✅ **Tone Assessment:** Analyzes formality and style (formal, informal, technical, conversational)
- ✅ **Structure Analysis:** Detects lists, headings, figure references, document organization
- ✅ **Special Elements:** Identifies URLs, emails, dates, measurements, currencies, percentages
- ✅ **Statistics:** Word counts, segment counts, unique terms
- ✅ **Smart Suggestions:** Generates actionable recommendations based on analysis

**Domain Detection Algorithm:**
- Keyword matching (300+ domain-specific keywords)
- Pattern recognition (technical formats, legal citations, medical codes)
- Confidence scoring with primary/secondary domain identification

**Suggestion Types Generated:**
- Domain optimization (switch to specialized prompt)
- Tone preservation (maintain formality level)
- Visual context (load figure references)
- Formatting rules (preserve measurements, currencies)
- Terminology management (use glossary for consistent translation)

## 🔮 Example Interactions

### **Example 1: Analyzing a Medical Document**

**User:** *Loads pharmaceutical document, clicks "Analyze Document"*

**AI Response:**
```
📊 Document Analysis Results

📝 Overview:
- 127 segments
- 3,450 words total
- 27.2 words per segment on average

🎯 Domain: Medical (confidence: 15.3)
   Secondary: Technical

✍️ Tone & Style:
- Formality: Very Formal
- Style: Technical

📋 Structure:
- List items: 23
- Potential headings: 8
- Figure references: 12

💡 Recommendations: 4 suggestion(s) available
```

**User:** *Clicks "Get Prompt Suggestion"*

**AI Response:**
```
📝 Here are my recommendations based on your document:

🔴 Optimize for Medical Domain
   Your document appears to be medical-related. Consider using a 
   specialized medical translation prompt.

🔴 Figure References Detected
   Found 12 references to figures. Consider loading visual context 
   in the Images tab.

🟡 Very Formal Language Detected
   This document uses highly formal language. Ensure your prompt 
   emphasizes maintaining professional tone and formal register.

🟡 Preserve Measurement Units
   Document contains many measurements. Add instruction to preserve 
   units exactly as written.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these suggestions?
```

### **Example 2: Conversational Assistance**

**User:** "Should I use a glossary for this document?"

**AI:** 
```
Yes, I recommend using a glossary for this document. Here's why:

Based on the analysis, I found 47 unique technical/specialized terms 
including capitalized terms and acronyms. This indicates rich domain-
specific terminology that should be translated consistently.

A glossary will help you:
1. Maintain consistent terminology across all 127 segments
2. Speed up translation with pre-approved terms
3. Ensure accuracy for repeated technical concepts

You can load or create a glossary in the "📚 Glossary" tab. If you're 
working on a pharmaceutical document, consider starting with a medical 
terminology glossary and customizing it for your specific needs.
```

**User:** "What's the best prompt for this type of document?"

**AI:**
```
For your medical/technical document with very formal tone, I recommend:

**Primary Choice:** Medical Translation Specialist prompt
- Handles medical terminology precisely
- Maintains formal register
- Preserves technical accuracy

**Customization Suggestions:**
Add these Custom Instructions for this specific project:
- Preserve all measurement units exactly (mg, ml, etc.)
- Maintain references to figures (Figure 1, Figure 2...)
- Use formal medical terminology, not colloquial terms
- Keep pharmaceutical compound names unchanged

You can set this up in:
1. LLM tab → Select "Medical Translation" system prompt
2. Custom Instructions tab → Add project-specific rules above
3. Images tab → Load figure images for visual context

Would you like me to help you create the custom instructions text?
```
