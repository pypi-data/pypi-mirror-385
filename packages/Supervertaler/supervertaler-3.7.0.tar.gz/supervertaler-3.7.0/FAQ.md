### Can I use Supervertaler offline?

**No** - Supervertaler requires:
- Internet connection for AI API calls (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Active API keys with credit/subscription

**Why online-only**:
- AI models run on provider servers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- No local AI models supported currently
- Context and processing require cloud AI infrastructure

**Future consideration**:
- Local model support (Ollama, LM Studio) possible in future versions
- Would enable offline usage with reduced capability
- Not currently implemented

## Workflow & Integration

### How do I integrate Supervertaler with my CAT tool?

**Method 1: Bilingual DOCX (Recommended)**
1. **In your CAT tool** (memoQ, CafeTran): Export bilingual DOCX
2. **In Supervertaler**: Import bilingual DOCX → Translate → Export bilingual DOCX
3. **In your CAT tool**: Reimport translated DOCX
4. **Result**: Segments populated with translations, formatting preserved

**Method 2: TMX Exchange**
1. **In your CAT tool**: Export source segments as TMX
2. **In Supervertaler**: Import TMX → Translate → Export TMX
3. **In your CAT tool**: Import translated TMX
4. **Result**: Target segments loaded into CAT tool project

**Method 3: Copy-Paste**
1. **In your CAT tool**: Copy source segments
2. **In Supervertaler**: Paste into TXT file → Import → Translate → Export
3. **In your CAT tool**: Copy translated segments back
4. **Result**: Translations in CAT tool (manual process)

**Best practice**: Use Method 1 (Bilingual DOCX) for seamless workflow

### What's the typical translation workflow?

**Standard Workflow (v2.5.0-CLASSIC)**:
1. **Prepare**: Gather source document, TM files, drawings (if technical)
2. **Load Resources**: 
   - Load TM files
   - Load drawing images (if applicable)
   - Load tracked changes (if available)
3. **Configure**:
   - Select AI provider and model
   - Choose system prompt (domain specialist)
   - Add custom instructions
4. **Import**: Load source DOCX or bilingual file
5. **Translate**: Click "Translate" → AI processes with all context
6. **Review**: Check translations, make edits
7. **Proofread** (optional): Run proofreading mode for QA
8. **Export**: Export to target format (DOCX, TMX, etc.)
9. **Deliver**: Send to client or reimport to CAT tool

**CAT Editor Workflow (v3.7.0)**:
1. **Start**: Launch → Start Screen → Choose action
2. **Import**: Import bilingual or DOCX file
3. **Configure**: AI settings, prompts, TM
4. **Translate**: Select segments → Translate (Ctrl+T)
5. **Edit**: Inline editing in Grid View
6. **Review**: Switch to Document View for readability check
7. **QA**: Use Find & Replace, check consistency
8. **Approve**: Change status to "Approved" (✓✓)
9. **Export**: Auto-export enabled formats generated
10. **Save Project**: Project saved with all context and progress

### How do I handle large documents?

**v2.5.0-CLASSIC**:
- Chunk size setting (default: 20 segments per API call)
- Reduce chunk size for very large documents
- Use batch processing with progress monitoring
- Save progress periodically (automatic)

**v3.7.0**:
- Grid pagination: 50 segments per page
- Translate page-by-page for control
- Or translate all with progress tracking
- Memory efficient: Only current page loaded
- Save project to preserve progress

**Best practices**:
- Split very large documents (>5000 segments) into sections
- Use pagination to focus on manageable chunks
- Save project frequently
- Consider API rate limits and costs for huge documents
- Process overnight for very large projects

### Can I customize the AI prompts?

**Yes!** Multiple customization levels:

**Level 1: Custom Instructions** (Simplest)
- Plain English guidelines
- Project-specific rules
- No technical knowledge needed
- Example: "Use formal tone and British spelling"

**Level 2: System Prompts** (Advanced)
- Define AI role and expertise
- Use template variables (`{source_lang}`, `{target_lang}`)
- Create domain specialists
- Example: "You are a medical translator specialized in {source_lang} to {target_lang} clinical trials"

**Level 3: Edit Source Code** (Expert)
- Modify agent prompt templates in Python code
- Change context structure
- Add custom processing logic
- Requires Python programming knowledge

**Unified Prompt Library (Ctrl+P)**:
- Browse and edit all prompts in one interface
- System Prompts + Custom Instructions tabs
- Create new prompts with visual editor
- Test different prompts on same content

## Troubleshooting

### Why is translation slow?

**Common causes**:
1. **Large chunk size**: Reduce chunk size in settings (default: 20 → try 10)
2. **Provider rate limits**: Some providers throttle requests
3. **Model choice**: Slower models (GPT-4, Claude Opus) take longer
4. **Large context**: Full document + TM + images = more tokens = slower
5. **Internet speed**: Slow connection affects API response time

**Solutions**:
- Use faster models (Gemini Flash, Claude Haiku)
- Reduce chunk size
- Disable unnecessary context sources
- Switch to better internet connection
- Consider batch processing overnight

### API errors - what do they mean?

**"Invalid API Key"**:
- Check `api_keys.txt` for typos
- Ensure key format is correct (starts with `sk-` for OpenAI/Claude)
- Verify key is active on provider dashboard
- Check key has not expired

**"Rate Limit Exceeded"**:
- Too many requests in short time
- Wait a few minutes before retrying
- Reduce chunk size to make fewer requests
- Upgrade API plan for higher limits

**"Context Length Exceeded"**:
- Document + context too large for model
- Reduce chunk size
- Disable image context if not needed
- Use model with larger context window (Gemini 1.5 Pro: 2M tokens)

**"Insufficient Credits"**:
- API account out of credits
- Add funds to provider account
- Check billing settings on provider dashboard

### Formatting is lost in export

**CafeTran**:
- Ensure pipe symbols `|text|` are preserved in target
- Check export uses "☕ Export to CafeTran DOCX" button (not generic export)
- Verify pipes appear as BOLD + RED in exported file
- If pipes missing, AI may have removed them - edit manually

**memoQ**:
- Use "📊 Export to memoQ DOCX" button (not generic export)
- Check source DOCX had formatting to begin with
- Formatting only preserved if present in original
- Manual formatting may be needed for complex styles

**General**:
- Some formatting may not survive translation (by design)
- Review exported file before reimporting to CAT tool
- Keep backup of original source file
- Report formatting issues on GitHub for investigation

### Program crashes or freezes

**Immediate solutions**:
- Force quit and restart program
- Check for unsaved work (projects auto-save periodically)
- Review log panel for error messages before crash

**Preventing future crashes**:
- Update Python to latest version
- Update libraries: `pip install --upgrade openai anthropic google-generativeai pillow python-docx openpyxl`
- Reduce chunk size for large documents
- Close other programs to free memory
- Check for antivirus interference
- Report crash with error message on GitHub Issues

**Data recovery**:
- Check `user data/Projects/` for auto-saved project
- Check `user data/` for exported files (TMX, session reports)
- Source files are never modified (always safe)

### How do I report a bug?

1. **Gather information**:
   - Supervertaler version (v2.5.0-CLASSIC or v3.7.0)
   - Python version (`python --version`)
   - Operating system and version
   - Error message (from log panel or console)
