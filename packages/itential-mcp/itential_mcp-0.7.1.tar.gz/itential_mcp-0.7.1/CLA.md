# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Itential MCP project (the "Project").

## Individual Contributor License Agreement

By signing this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"), you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future contributions submitted to Itential, Inc. ("Itential"). Except for the license granted herein to Itential and recipients of software distributed by Itential, you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to your contributions.

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Itential.

**"Contribution"** shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Itential for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Itential (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Itential or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Itential for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Itential and to recipients of software distributed by Itential a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Itential and to recipients of software distributed by Itential a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4. Representations

You represent that:

a) You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Itential, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Itential.

b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

c) Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

### 5. Support

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### 6. Third Party Contributions

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Itential separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

### 7. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify Itential of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
