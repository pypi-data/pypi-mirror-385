# Description             This python file contains Microbit,
# Hummingbird, and Finch classes.
#
# The Microbit class controls a micro:bit via bluetooth. It
# includes methods to print on the micro:bit LED array or set
# those LEDs individually. It also contains methods to read the
# values of the micro:bit accelerometer and magnetometer.
#
# The Hummingbird class extends the Microbit class to incorporate
# functions to control the inputs and outputs of the Hummingbird
# Bit. It includes methods to set the values of motors and LEDs,
# as well as methods to read the values of the sensors.
#
# The Finch class also extends the Microbit class. This class
# similarly includes function to control the inputs and outputs
# of the Finch robot.

# This file is left for historical reasons and backward
# compatibility. Originally, all classes were in this single
# file. Now they are broken into separate files and published
# in pypi.org.
