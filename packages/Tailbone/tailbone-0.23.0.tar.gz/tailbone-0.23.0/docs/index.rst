Tailbone
========

Welcome to Tailbone, part of the Rattail project.  While the core Rattail
package provides the data layer, the Tailbone package provides the (default,
back-end) web application layer.

Some additional information is available on the `website`_.  Certainly not
everything is documented yet, but here you can see what has received some
attention thus far.
