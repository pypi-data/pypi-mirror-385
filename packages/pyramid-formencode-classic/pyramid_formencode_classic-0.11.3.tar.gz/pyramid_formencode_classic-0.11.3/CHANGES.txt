    * introduce validators.RequireEmptyIfMissing
    * introduce validators.RequireEmptyIfPresent

0.11.2
    * introduce tools.document_form
    * introduce validators.OnlyOneOf

0.11.1
    * add `allow_empty` kwarg to form_validate;
      this will allow for forms to have an empty POST, and defer to the
      formencode `if_missing` default values

0.11.0
    * consolidated all logging into "pyramid_formencode_classic" namespace
    * add debug mode. To enable::

        `form_validate(debug_fails=True)`

        or

        `FormStash(debug_fails=True)`

        or

        `pyramid_formencode_classic.DEBUG_FAILS = True`

      This will log, at `logging.DEBUG` level, a stacktrace via the traceback module

0.10.2
    * Added typing to FormStash
    * added `FormStash.error_main` property
    * fixed debugtoolbar template

0.10.1
    * Support "appending" error messages onto fields when there are complex errors
      By default, set_error/fatal_field will overwrite an existing error.
      When submitting `error_field_overwrite=False`, the error will be appended to any existing error.

        added kwarg to `formStash.set_error`
            error_field_overwrite: bool = True

0.9.0
    BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    Releases `0.7.0`, `0.8.0` and `0.9.0` were released in quick succession to
    make significant changes to the API and functionality easier to adopt.

    For most users, the general change will be this:

        `FormInvalid` and `FormFieldInvalid` now require a `formStash`
        `FormStash.__init__` now requires a schema
        `FormStash.fatal_form` message is now `error_main`
        `FormStash.fatal_field` message is now `error_field`

    There are a few other changes, but the above are the most significant.

    These changes were done to make the package more maintainable and usable - as Field exceptions can cascade onto Forms.

    The 0.8.0 branch offers some additional control allowing complex error messages to
    append, prepend, or overwrite existing errors.  This control was stripped out
    of the 0.9.0 branch, in favor of introducing special "meta-errors" about the form.

    This release continues the work of 0.8.0 in trying to minimize and simplify
    the API while still giving control of the meta/special errors.

    FormStash-
        the processed form data is now within a dict, ``ParsedForm```
            Changes:
                self.defaults -> self.parsed_form["defaults"]
                self.errors -> self.parsed_form["errors"]
                self.results -> self.parsed_form["results"]
            properties are used to make this (mostly) backwards compatible
        `set_error_nothing_submitted` is now `set_error_nothing_submitted(_set_error__nothing_submitted)`
        `set_error` now accepts `integrate_special_errors:bool`
        `fatal_form` no longer accepts:
            message_overwrite
            message_append
            message_prepend
        `fatal_field` no longer accepts:
            message_overwrite
            message_append
            message_prepend
        `_raise_unique_FormInvalid` no longer accepts:
            error_message_overwrite
            error_message_append
            error_message_prepend

    * `exceptions.FormInvalid`
        removed `error_main_overwrite`
        removed `error_main_append`
        removed `error_main_prepend`
        added `integrate_special_errors`
        added `error_no_submission_text`
    * `exceptions.FormFieldInvalid`
        removed `message_append`
        removed `message_prepend`
        removed `error_main_append`
        removed `error_main_prepend`
        added `raised_by`
        added `integrate_special_errors`
        added `error_no_submission_text`

0.8.0

    BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    (unreleased)

    This release was made to make the API easier to manage, as such, major
    breaking changes were required.

    Most of the work, and uglyness, comes from trying to control how the
    "Nothing Submitted." message persists.
    
    To maintain control of how this message renders, some kwargs were renamed
    and others were added.  A 0.9.0 branch removes many of these for an
    alternate strategy.

    BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES

    * `exceptions.FormInvalid`
        kwargs:
            `formStash` (formerly `form`) is now the first required arg
            `message` is now `error_main`
            `error_main_overwrite` is new
            `message_append` is now `error_main_append`
            `message_prepend` is now `error_main_prepend`
            `raised_by` is new
        `errors` arg and attribute are removed; use the formStash instead
    * `exceptions.FormFieldInvalid`
        kwargs:
            `formStash` (formerly `form`) is now the first required arg
            `message` is now `error_field`
            `error_main` is new
            `error_main_append` is new
            `error_main_prepend` is new
            `allow_unknown_fields` is new
            `raised_by` is new
        `errors` arg and attribute are removed; use the formStash instead
    * `objects.FormStash.fatal_form`
        kwargs:
            `message` is now `error_main`
            `error_main_overwrite` is new
    * `objects.FormStash.fatal_field`
        kwargs:
            `field` arg[0] is now required
            `message` is now `error_field`
            `error_main` is new
            `message_overwrite` is new
                `allow_unknown_fields` is new
    * removed `form_validate_simple`
    * formatter_hidden
        now stores error in "value" instead of "name"

    Other changes:
        `objects.FormStash::fatal_field`
        * function typed to raise exception with `typing.NoReturn`

        `objects.FormStash::fatal_form`
        * `message` renamed to `error_main`
        * function typed to raise exception with `typing.NoReturn`

0.7.0
    BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
    * `_form_validate_core`
      * now requires `request`; this should not affect anything
      * now requires `schema`; this should not affect anything
      * `form_stash_object` now named `formStash`
      * the `schema` is now stored in the `FormStash` result
      * dropped `return_stash`; ALWAYS return a tuple
      * dropped `raise_FormFieldInvalid` as it made no sense in context;
        use `raise_FormInvalid`
    * `form_validate`
      * now requires `schema`; this should not affect anything
      * dropped `return_stash`; ALWAYS return a tuple
    * `form_validate_simple`
      * now requires `schema`; this should not affect anything
      * dropped `return_stash`; ALWAYS return a tuple
    * `FormStash`
        now requires a `schema`
    * `FormInvalid`
        kwarg `form` is now `formStash`
    * `FormFieldInvalid`
        kwarg `form` is now `formStash`

    New:
        beware that raising a `FormInvalid(formStash)` will invoke the seterror and utilize the append/prepend args

0.6.0
    BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
    * `form_validate` now requires `return_stash=True` - which is enabled by default.
      To support `return_stash=False`, please call `form_validate_simple` instead.
      This change was required to streamline typing and better standardize the library.
      Background:
        `form_validate` was renamed to `_form_validate_core`
        the new `form_validate` ensures `return_stash==True` and invokes `_form_validate_core`
        the new `form_validate_simple` ensures `return_stash==False` and invokes `_form_validate_core`

0.5.0
    * drop py2
    * mypy support
    * reorganized a lot of code/functions into new files.
      the relevant imports should be unchanged.

		* `FieldInvalid` renamed to `FormFieldInvalid`
		* `FormFieldInvalid` inherits from `FormInvalid`

	* new : `FormStash.register_error_main_exception`
	* new : `FormStash.fatal_form()`
	* new : `FormStash.fatal_field()`

0.4.0
	accidentally released to pypi. deleted; should not be used.


0.3.1
	* introduced kwarg `foreach_defense=True` to `form_validate`. enabled by default, this defends against
	  situations where a `ForEach` implementation creates a list of errors instead of a single error.
    * redid description in `setup.py`

0.3.0
	Python3
	removed deprecated functions
	
	* FormStash.html_error_main

                  "legacy functionality is available via `render_html_error_main`."
                  )
        return self.html_error_placeholder(field=field)
	* formatter_none

	2013.08.27
	- packaging fixes

0.0.12
	2012.08.17
	- migrated all forms to live under a dict in request.pyramid_formencode_classic and use an API for get/set , this should create a much cleaner request and programming style

0.0.11
	2012.07.19
	- cgi escape will now show the output for formatter_none to aid in debugging.  there may be a future toggle for this behavior.
	- form_validate now has a error_string_key that will be used when a string error exists ( string error should be a schema error )
	- form_validate is better inline with the classic formencode behavior, specifically the management of mixed() params
	- form_validate will now test errors for type, and coerce a String error into a Dict, using error_string_key as the key.  this should make developing against this easier,
	- form_reprint is better inline with the classic formencode behavior, specifically cloning the htmlfill_kwargs and setting a default encoding to match request.charset
