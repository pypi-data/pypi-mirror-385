### script loops through filtered BAM file containing intratelomeric reads and searches for patterns of the type XXXGGG (and reverse complement)               ###
### only counts patterns if the base qualities are all greater than 20                                                                                         ###
### pattern counts are written to output tables (with the frequency of the pattern and the average base quality at each position)                              ###
