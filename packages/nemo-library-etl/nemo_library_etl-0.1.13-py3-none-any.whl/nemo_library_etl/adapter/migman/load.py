"""
MigMan ETL Load Module.

This module handles the loading phase of the MigMan ETL pipeline.
It takes the transformed data and loads it into the target system, typically the
Nemo database or data warehouse.

The loading process typically includes:
1. Data validation before insertion
2. Connection management to target systems
3. Batch processing for efficient data loading
4. Error handling and rollback capabilities
5. Data integrity checks post-loading
6. Performance optimization for large datasets
7. Comprehensive logging throughout the process

Classes:
    MigManLoad: Main class handling MigMan data loading.

    Handles loading of transformed MigMan data into target system.

    This class manages the loading phase of the MigMan ETL pipeline,
    providing methods to insert transformed data into the target system with
    proper error handling, validation, and performance optimization.

    The loader:
    - Uses NemoLibrary for core functionality and configuration
    - Integrates with Prefect logging for pipeline visibility
    - Manages database connections and transactions
    - Provides batch processing capabilities
    - Handles data validation before insertion
    - Ensures data integrity and consistency
    - Optimizes performance for large datasets

        nl (NemoLibrary): Core Nemo library instance for system integration.
        config: Configuration object from the Nemo library.
        logger: Prefect logger for pipeline execution tracking.
        cfg (PipelineMigMan): Pipeline configuration with loading settings.

        Execute the main loading process for MigMan data.

        This method orchestrates the complete loading process by:
        1. Connecting to the target system (database, data warehouse, etc.)
        2. Loading transformed data from the previous ETL phase
        3. Validating data before insertion
