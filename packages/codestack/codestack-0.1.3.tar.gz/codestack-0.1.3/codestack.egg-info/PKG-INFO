# For valid model name and API Key - visit Google AI Studio
```

```python
from codestack import create_env, build_project, preview_project

# Step 1: If you haven't created the .env file already to create a .env file
create_env()
# Set the appropriate API keys and model name in the .env

# Step 2: Build a project from a natural language prompt
build_project(
    "Create a functional finance calculator using HTML, CSS, Javascript which has the following features: CAGR calculator, EMI calculator, wealth time estimator",
    output_dir="finance_calculator"
)

# Try to be as concise as possible in the instructions - Mentioning the tech stack for better results.

# Step 3: Preview the generated project
preview_project("finance_calculator")

# Developers have full access to the generated project for further customization and development
