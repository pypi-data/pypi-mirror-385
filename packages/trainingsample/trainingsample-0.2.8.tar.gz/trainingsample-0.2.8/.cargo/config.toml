# Cargo configuration for OpenCV linking
#
# Default: Uses system OpenCV (for CI and local development)
# Release builds: Override with static linking via workflow env vars

# This file is intentionally minimal - it lets opencv-rust probe the system.
# The release workflow sets OPENCV_* env vars to force static linking.
