## About The Project

**Samvaad** (Sanskrit for "dialogue") is an open-source software that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities with end-to-end voice capabilities. Users can add their documents, Samvaad will index and store them, and then users can have a text or voice conversation with those documents that delivers accurate, context-aware answers. Built with a modular backend and a modern frontend (in the works), Samvaad makes it easy to learn new topics, get ahead of confusions, and stay learning - all while feeling like a friend.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11**: This project is optimized for Python 3.11. Some dependencies (like sounddevice for voice features) provide wheels primarily for this version. Ensure you're using 3.11:
  ```sh
  python --version  # Should show Python 3.11.x
  ```

Follow these steps to set up and run Samvaad locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HapoSeiz/samvaad.git
cd samvaad
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

**Install uv (if not already installed):**
```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```sh
uv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

*Note: uv creates a `.venv` directory by default (with a dot). The activation command uses `.venv/bin/activate` on Unix systems.*

### 3. Install Samvaad

**Option 1: Install from PyPI (recommended):**

For CPU-only systems:
```sh
pip install samvaad[cpu]
```

For GPU systems (CUDA 12.1):
```sh
pip install samvaad[gpu]
```

**Option 2: Install from source:**

For CPU-only systems:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/atharva-again/samvaad.git
cd samvaad
pip install -e .[cpu]
```

For GPU systems:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/atharva-again/samvaad.git
cd samvaad
pip install -e .[gpu]
```

**Note:** Always ensure your virtual environment is activated before installing packages. If you encounter PyTorch installation issues, visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for manual installation instructions.

### Important: Install Required Llama-cpp-python Fork

Samvaad requires a special fork of `llama-cpp-python` for Gemma model support. **You must install this manually before installing Samvaad:**

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/inference-sh/llama-cpp-python.git
```

Then install Samvaad as usual:

```sh
pip install samvaad[cpu]
# or
pip install samvaad[gpu]
```

### 4. Add Your Documents

Place your documents inside the `data/documents/` folder. Supported file types include:
- **PDF files** (.pdf)
- **Microsoft Office documents** (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx)
- **Text files** (.txt, .md)
- **Web pages** (.html, .htm)
- **Images** (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff, .bmp) - with OCR support
- **Other formats** supported by Docling (e.g., .rtf, .epub)

These will be used as the chatbot's knowledge base.

### 5. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

```sh
# Copy and edit the following into .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
You can get your `Gemini_API_Key` [here](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).

**Note:** The system works without API keys but will only show retrieved context without AI-generated answers.

### 6. Process Your Documents

Run the interactive CLI to ingest documents:

```sh
samvaad
```

Then use commands like:
- `i document.pdf` to ingest a file
- `q What is the main topic?` to query

### 7. Query Your Knowledge Base

Use the interactive CLI for querying:

```sh
samvaad
```

Inside the CLI:
- `q What are the main findings?` - Basic query


### Voice Queries

Samvaad supports multilingual voice queries, allowing you to ask questions in Hindi, English, Hinglish, or other languages. The system transcribes your speech and responds in the same language/style.

```sh
# Start interactive mode
samvaad

# Inside CLI:
v
# This starts voice recording mode. Speak your question in any supported language.
# The system will transcribe, process, and respond accordingly.
```

**Supported Languages:** Hindi, Hinglish (code-mixed), English, and auto-detection for other languages.

**TTS Engine Options:**
- **Kokoro TTS:** Neural TTS engine with high-quality voices (English & Hindi)

```sh
# Voice query with Kokoro TTS
v
```

**Features:**
- Automatic silence detection (2 seconds of silence stops recording)
- Markdown-aware responses (clean text for both display and speech)
- Audio responses saved to `data/audio_responses/` with engine-specific filenames
- Real-time language detection and appropriate voice selection

### API Endpoints

Samvaad provides a REST API for programmatic access:

**TTS Endpoint:**
```http
POST /tts
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Your text here",
  "language": "en"
}
```

**Supported TTS Engine:**
- `kokoro` - Neural TTS (higher quality, English & Hindi)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "audio_base64": "base64_encoded_wav_data",
  "sample_rate": 24000,
  "format": "wav"
}
```

### Direct Voice Query Usage

For direct voice queries without the interactive CLI:

```sh
# Voice query with Kokoro TTS
python -m backend.pipeline.retrieval.query_voice

# Voice query with specific Gemini model
python -m backend.pipeline.retrieval.query_voice --model gemini-2.5-flash
```


## Usage Examples

### Interactive CLI

Samvaad now uses an interactive command-line interface for all operations:

```sh
samvaad
```

Available commands:
- `i <file>` or `ingest <file>` - Process and ingest a file
- `q <text>` or `query <text>` - Query the knowledge base
- `v` or `voice` - Start voice query mode (supports multiple languages like Hindi, English, Hinglish)
- `r <file>` or `remove <file>` - Remove a file and its embeddings
- `h` or `help` - Show help
- `e` or `exit` - Exit the CLI

### Document Processing

```sh
# Start interactive mode
samvaad

# Inside CLI:
i documents/research_paper.pdf
# Output includes timing: ‚è±Ô∏è Parsing time: 0.1234 seconds, etc.

# Remove a document
r documents/old_file.pdf
# Output: ‚è±Ô∏è Deletion time: 0.0567 seconds
```

### Querying Your Knowledge Base

```sh
# Start interactive mode
python -m backend.test

# Inside CLI:
q "What are the main findings?"
# Output includes total query time and sources

q "Explain the methodology" -k 8
# Retrieve more context chunks

q "What are the implications?" -m gemini-2.5-flash
# Use Gemini model for answers
```

### Performance Monitoring

The CLI now shows timing for each step:

```
‚è±Ô∏è Parsing time: 0.1234 seconds
‚è±Ô∏è Chunking time: 0.0567 seconds
‚è±Ô∏è Embedding time: 1.2345 seconds
‚è±Ô∏è Storage time: 0.0890 seconds
‚è±Ô∏è Total query time: 2.3456 seconds
‚è±Ô∏è Deletion time: 0.0123 seconds
```

### GPU Acceleration

If a CUDA-compatible GPU is detected, operations will automatically use GPU acceleration for:
- Document parsing (Docling)
- Text embeddings (SentenceTransformer)
- Cross-encoder reranking
- LLM inference (if supported)

Check GPU usage with `nvidia-smi` during processing.

### Example Output

```

### Running Tests

**Run all tests:**
```sh
pytest
```

**Run unit tests only:**
```sh
pytest tests/unit/
```

**Run integration tests only:**
```sh
pytest tests/integration/
```

**Run specific test file:**
```sh
pytest tests/unit/test_utils.py -v
```

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests:** Test the complete RAG pipeline end-to-end
- **Mocking:** External dependencies (APIs, databases, ML models) are mocked for reliable testing
- **CI/CD Ready:** Tests are designed to run in automated environments

### About Test Warnings

Some warnings may appear during test runs from external dependencies (e.g., `docling-core`, `google-genai`). These warnings are **not from Samvaad code** but from upstream libraries that have known deprecation issues in Pydantic v2.12+. Here's how to minimize them:

**To reduce or eliminate warnings:**
1. Keep dependencies updated: `uv pip install --upgrade docling google-genai pydantic setuptools`
2. These are deprecation notices that will be fixed in future releases of the upstream libraries
3. The warnings do not affect functionality - all 175+ tests pass successfully

**Current state (as of Oct 2025):**
- `docling-core` 2.49.0: Pending upstream fix for Pydantic validator pattern
- `google-genai` 1.45.0: Pending upstream fix for Pydantic validator pattern  
- `setuptools` 80.9.0: `pkg_resources` deprecation warning (expected to be removed in setuptools 81+)

These warnings will disappear once the upstream libraries update their code to use instance methods instead of classmethods for Pydantic validators (required by Pydantic v2.12+).

## Continuous Integration

Automated test runs execute through GitHub Actions. The workflow runs CPU tests on all pushes and pull requests to `main`. GPU tests run only on pushes to `main` to avoid the overhead of installing large PyTorch GPU wheels on every PR. Both configurations exercise the full `pytest` suite. No additional secrets are required for the suite to pass because external services are mocked in the tests. You can monitor the latest builds from the **Actions** tab on GitHub.
