```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from lowmind import Tensor, MicroCNN, cross_entropy_loss, SGD

# Create optimized tensors
x = Tensor(np.random.randn(32, 3, 32, 32), name='input_batch')
y = Tensor(np.random.randint(0, 10, (32,)), name='targets')

# Initialize ultra-lightweight model
model = MicroCNN(num_classes=10)

# Forward pass with memory tracing
output = model(x)
loss = cross_entropy_loss(output, y)

# Efficient backward pass
loss.backward()

# Optimized parameter update
optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
optimizer.step()
```

### Advanced Monitoring
```python
from lowmind import RaspberryPiAdvancedMonitor

# Comprehensive system monitoring
monitor = RaspberryPiAdvancedMonitor()
monitor.print_detailed_status()

# Health assessment
health_score = monitor.get_health_score()
print(f"System Health: {health_score:.1f}/100")
```

## 🚨 Best Practices

### Memory Management
```python
# ✅ Good: Use memory-efficient operations
x = a.matmul_memory_efficient(b)

# ❌ Avoid: Large intermediate tensors
# x = a @ b  # Could cause memory overflow on large matrices

# ✅ Good: Regular cleanup
memory_manager.free_unused()

# ✅ Good: Use context managers for profiling
with memory_trace("Critical Operation"):
    result = expensive_operation()
```

### Model Design
- Use `MicroCNN` for computer vision tasks
- Prefer `Linear` layers over large `Conv2d` layers
- Implement gradient checkpointing for very deep networks
- Use mixed precision where possible
