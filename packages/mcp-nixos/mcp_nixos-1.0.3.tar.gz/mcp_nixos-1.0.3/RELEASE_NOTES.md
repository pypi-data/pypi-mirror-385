# MCP-NixOS: v1.0.0 Release Notes - The Great Simplification

## Overview

MCP-NixOS v1.0.0 is a complete rewrite that proves less is more. We've drastically simplified the codebase while maintaining 100% functionality and adding new features. This isn't just a refactor—it's a masterclass in minimalism.

## Changes in v1.0.0

### 🎯 The Nuclear Option

- **Complete Rewrite**: Drastically simplified the entire codebase
- **Stateless Operation**: No more cache directories filling up your disk
- **Direct API Calls**: Removed all abstraction layers—now it's just functions doing their job
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Reduced from 5 to 3 core dependencies (40% reduction)
- **Two-File Implementation**: Everything you need in just `server.py` and `__main__.py`
- **Resolves #22**: Completely eliminated pickle usage and the entire cache layer

### 🚀 Major Improvements

- **Plain Text Output**: All responses now return human-readable plain text (no XML!)
- **NixHub Integration**: Added package version history tools
  - `nixhub_package_versions`: Get version history with nixpkgs commits
  - `nixhub_find_version`: Smart search for specific versions
- **Dynamic Channel Resolution**: Auto-discovers current stable channel
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Suggestions when exact matches fail
- **Flake Search**: Added deduplicated flake package search
- **Better Stats**: Accurate statistics for all tools
- **Zero Configuration**: Removed all the config options you weren't using anyway
- **Faster Startup**: No cache initialization, no state management, just pure functionality
- **100% Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite ensures everything works as advertised

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- **No More Caching**: All operations are now stateless (your internet better be working)
- **Environment Variables Removed**: Only `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` remains
- **No Pre-Cache Option**: The `--pre-cache` flag is gone (along with the cache itself)
- **No Interactive Shell**: The deprecated CLI has been completely removed

### 🧹 What We Removed

- `cache/` directory - Complex caching that nobody understood
- `clients/` directory - Abstract interfaces that abstracted nothing
- `contexts/` directory - Context managers for contexts that didn't exist
- `resources/` directory - MCP resource definitions (now inline)
- `tools/` directory - Tool implementations (now in server.py)
- `utils/` directory - "Utility" functions that weren't
- 45 files of over-engineered complexity

### 📊 The Numbers

- **Before**: Many files with layers of abstraction
- **After**: Just 2 core files that matter
- **Result**: Dramatically less code, zero reduction in functionality, more features added

## Installation

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install mcp-nixos==1.0.0

# Install with uv
uv pip install mcp-nixos==1.0.0

# Install with uvx
uvx mcp-nixos==1.0.0
```

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from v0.x:

1. **Remove cache-related environment variables** - They don't do anything anymore
2. **Remove `--pre-cache` from any scripts** - It's gone
3. **That's it** - Everything else just works

## Why This Matters

This release demonstrates that most "enterprise" code is just complexity for complexity's sake. By removing abstractions, caching layers, and "design patterns," we've created something that:

- Is easier to understand
- Has fewer bugs (less code = less bugs)
- Starts faster
- Uses less memory
- Is more reliable

Sometimes the best code is the code you delete.
