    """ Inverts pooling and BatchNormalization layers in a model to have BN layer before pooling.

    Returns a new model where pooling and batch normalization layers are inverted. From a Keras
    model where pooling layers precede batch normalization layers, this function places the BN
    layers before pooling layers. This is the first step before folding BN layers into processing
    layers.

    Note:
        Inversion of layers is equivalent only if the gammas of BN layers are positive. The
        function raises an error if not.
