## Getting Started

```bash
# Install

assertlang generate agent.pw --lang go
```

## What Makes This Special

This is the **only** framework that can:

## üöÄ Release Day (Zero-Effort Distribution)

### Option 1: Minimal (Just GitHub)
1. ‚úÖ Publish GitHub release (done above)
2. ‚úÖ Pin repository on your GitHub profile
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Let people find it organically

**That's it.** GitHub's algorithm will surface it to people searching for:
- "code translator"
- "cross-language"
- "bidirectional parser"
- "Python to Go converter"

### Option 2: Low-Effort (+30 mins)
1. Do Option 1
2. Post **once** on:
   - Hacker News "Show HN: AssertLang - Bidirectional code translator across 5 languages"
   - Reddit r/programming (if you use Reddit)
   - Dev.to (write-once blog post)

**No ongoing effort.** Just one announcement, then done.

### Option 3: No Social Media (Your Choice)
Skip everything above. Just:
1. ‚úÖ Make repo public (it already is)
2. ‚úÖ Add good README (done)
3. ‚úÖ Tag release v1.0.0

People will find it via:
- Google searches for "Python to Go translator"
- GitHub search/topics
- Other developers starring it
- Word of mouth

## üì¢ What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Don't create:**
- Twitter account
- Discord server
- Slack workspace
- Weekly newsletters
- YouTube channel
- Blog

‚ùå **Don't feel obligated to:**
- Respond to every issue immediately
- Accept every PR
- Write documentation for every question
- Market the project constantly

---

## ‚úÖ What TO Do (Minimal Maintenance)

**Weekly (15 mins):**
- Check GitHub notifications
- Respond to 1-2 issues if easy
- Merge good PRs if any

**Monthly (30 mins):**
- Review open issues
- Close stale/duplicate issues
- Fix 1 critical bug if reported

**Quarterly (1 hour):**
- Cut a new release if you added features
- Update README if needed
- Review and clean up issue labels

**That's it.** No more than 1-2 hours per month.

---

## üéØ Success Metrics (Organic Growth)

**Week 1:**
- 10-50 stars (if you post on HN/Reddit)
- 1-10 stars (if purely organic)

**Month 1:**
- 50-200 stars (good traction)
- 5-10 issues filed
- 0-2 PRs (maybe)

**Year 1:**
- 500-2000 stars (if useful)
- 50-100 issues
- 10-20 PRs
- 1-2 regular contributors (if lucky)

**None of this is guaranteed.** Most open source projects get <50 stars. Yours has a unique value prop, so likely to do better.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Setting Boundaries

Add this to your GitHub profile README (optional):

```markdown
## Open Source Maintainer

I maintain open source projects on a best-effort basis:
- ‚úÖ Active maintenance, reviews when I have time
- ‚è∞ Response time: days to weeks (not hours)
- üôè Patience appreciated, contributions welcome
- üìß No guaranteed support - this is free software

Projects: AssertLang (universal code translator)
```

This sets expectations that you're not a full-time maintainer.

## üéâ Launch Checklist

**Pre-Launch:**
- [ ] Git commit and push to main
- [ ] Create GitHub release v1.0.0
- [ ] Add release notes
- [ ] Pin repo on GitHub profile

**Launch (Pick One):**
- [ ] Option 1: GitHub only (zero effort)
- [ ] Option 2: HN/Reddit post (30 mins)
- [ ] Option 3: Do nothing, let it grow

**Post-Launch:**
- [ ] Check GitHub once a week
- [ ] Respond when you have time
- [ ] Don't stress about it

---

## üí° Final Advice

**Your project is done.** You built something amazing. Now:

1. **Ship it** (publish the release)
2. **Forget about marketing** (you don't have time)
3. **Let it find its audience** (organic growth is fine)
4. **Maintain when you want** (not when others demand)
5. **Be proud** (you solved a hard problem)

The best open source projects grow slowly and organically. You don't need social media, marketing, or constant engagement. Just good code and clear documentation.

**You've done both.** Now release it and see what happens.

---

**Status:** Ready to launch
**Time Required:** 15 mins (release) + 0-30 mins (optional announcement)
**Ongoing Effort:** 1-2 hours/month (your choice)
