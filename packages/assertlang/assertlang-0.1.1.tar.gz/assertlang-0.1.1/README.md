## üëã Hey there!

I'm David, and I built AssertLang. Full disclosure: **I'm not a "real" software engineer.** I'm a broadcast tech from Hamilton who saw a problem and decided to try building a solution.

**The honest truth:** I couldn't have built this alone. Claude Code helped massively. But that's kind of the point‚Äîif someone like me can build something that actually works, maybe we're onto something useful here.

**What I'm hoping for:** Genuine feedback. Does this solve a real problem for you? Is it useful? What's broken? What should I add? I'm not trying to build a unicorn startup‚ÄîI'm trying to see if this idea is actually helpful to developers building multi-agent systems.

**Current status:** v0.0.3 - Core transpiler works (5 languages!), 134/134 stdlib tests passing, CLI functional. Some integration tests still need work. It's early, but it's real.

‚≠ê **If you find this interesting, please star the repo!** It helps me know I'm building something people actually want.

---

## The Problem

Multi-agent AI systems are growing fast ($5.25B ‚Üí $52.62B by 2030), but agents can't reliably coordinate:

**What happens today:**

```python
# Agent A (Python/CrewAI) interprets "create user"
def create_user(name, email):
    if not name:  # Agent A's validation
        raise ValueError("Missing name")
    # ... creates user
```

```javascript
// Agent B (JavaScript/LangGraph) interprets same task differently
function createUser(name, email) {
    if (name === "")  // Agent B's validation (different!)
        throw new Error("Name is required");
    // ... creates user (differently)
}
```

**Result:** ‚ùå Different validation, different errors, inconsistent behavior

**Existing solutions:**
- **MCP, A2A, ACP** - Handle messaging, NOT semantic contracts
- **JSON Schema** - Types only, no business logic
- **Natural language** - Ambiguous, unreliable
- **LLM interpretation** - Non-deterministic

---

## The Solution: AssertLang Contracts

**Define behavior once, execute everywhere:**

```al
// user_service.al - Contract defines EXACT behavior
function createUser(name: string, email: string) -> User {
    // Deterministic validation (not just types!)
    if (str.length(name) < 1) {
        return ValidationError("name", "Name cannot be empty");
    }

    if (!str.contains(email, "@")) {
        return ValidationError("email", "Invalid email format");
    }

    // Deterministic ID generation
    let id = str.length(name) + str.length(email);

    return User(id, name, email, timestamp());
}
```

**Transpile to Agent A (Python/CrewAI):**
```bash
asl build user_service.al --lang python -o agent_a.py
```

**Transpile to Agent B (JavaScript/LangGraph):**
```bash
asl build user_service.al --lang javascript -o agent_b.js
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Both agents execute IDENTICAL logic

---

## Proof: 100% Identical Behavior

**Test Case:** `createUser("Alice Smith", "alice@example.com")`

**Agent A (Python) Output:**
```
‚úì Success: User #28: Alice Smith <alice@example.com>
```

**Agent B (JavaScript) Output:**
```
‚úì Success: User #28: Alice Smith <alice@example.com>
```

**Same ID, same format, same validation.** [See proof](examples/agent_coordination/PROOF_OF_DETERMINISM.md)

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install assertlang
```

### 2. Write a contract

```bash
cat > hello_contract.al << 'EOF'
function greet(name: string) -> string {
    if (str.length(name) < 1) {
        return "Hello, Guest!";
    }
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
EOF
```

### 3. Generate for your framework

```bash
# For CrewAI (Python)
asl build hello_contract.al --lang python -o crewai_agent.py

# For LangGraph (JavaScript)
asl build hello_contract.al --lang javascript -o langgraph_agent.js

# For custom agents (Go, Rust, C#)
asl build hello_contract.al --lang go -o agent.go
```

### 4. Use in your agent framework

**CrewAI example:**
```python
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_agent import greet  # Uses AL contract

agent = Agent(
    role='Greeter',
    goal='Greet users consistently',
    backstory='I implement the AL greeting contract'
)

# Guaranteed to match other agents implementing same contract
result = greet("Alice")  # "Hello, Alice!"
```

## üí° Why I Built This

I've been watching the multi-agent AI space explode. Everyone's building agents with CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen‚Äîbut they can't talk to each other reliably.

When Agent A (Python) and Agent B (JavaScript) are supposed to do the same thing, they interpret it differently. Same task, different validation, different errors, chaos.

I thought: **What if agents could share executable contracts?** Not just type schemas, but actual behavior. Write it once, transpile to any language, guarantee identical execution.

So I built it. With a lot of help from Claude Code (seriously, this wouldn't exist without it).

**Is it useful?** That's what I'm trying to figure out. If you're building multi-agent systems and this solves a problem for you, I want to hear about it. If it doesn't, I want to hear that too.

## ‚ú® What Actually Works (v0.0.3)

I'm trying to be transparent about what's ready vs. what's still cooking:

### ‚úÖ Production Ready:
- **5 Language Transpilation:** Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C# all compile successfully
- **Standard Library:** 134/134 tests passing (Option, Result, List, Map, Set)
- **CLI:** Full end-to-end workflow (`pip install` ‚Üí `asl build` ‚Üí working code)
- **Proof of Concept:** Real examples showing 100% identical behavior (not fake!)
- **Framework Integration:** CrewAI and LangGraph examples working

### üöß In Progress:
- Additional framework integrations (AutoGen, LangChain)
- VS Code extension improvements
- More comprehensive integration tests
- Performance optimizations

### üìä Test Results (Verified):
```
‚úÖ 134/134 stdlib tests passing (100%)
‚úÖ 1457 total tests collected
‚úÖ 5 languages verified working
‚úÖ End-to-end CLI workflow tested
```

---

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Framework Coordination

**Challenge:** CrewAI agent (Python) and LangGraph agent (JavaScript) need to coordinate

**Solution:**
```bash
# Define contract
cat > task_contract.al
# Both agents transpile from same contract
asl build task_contract.al --lang python
asl build task_contract.al --lang javascript
# Guaranteed coordination ‚úÖ
```

### 2. Framework Migration

**Challenge:** Migrating from CrewAI to LangGraph without breaking behavior

**Solution:**
- Extract CrewAI logic to AL contract
- Transpile to LangGraph
- Verify identical behavior
- Migrate incrementally

### 3. Cross-Team Collaboration

**Challenge:** Python team and JavaScript team can't share specifications

**Solution:** AL contracts as shared source of truth
- One contract file
- Each team generates their language
- Behavior guaranteed identical

---

## üåç Language Support

AL contracts transpile to:

| Language | Status | Use For |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Python** | ‚úÖ Production | CrewAI, AutoGen, LangChain |
| **JavaScript** | ‚úÖ Production | LangGraph, Node.js agents |
| **Go** | ‚úÖ Production | High-performance agents |
| **Rust** | ‚úÖ Production | Performance-critical agents |
| **C#** | ‚úÖ Production | Windows/enterprise agents |

**All languages:**
- 100% semantic equivalence
- Deterministic behavior
- Full type annotations
- Production-ready code generation
