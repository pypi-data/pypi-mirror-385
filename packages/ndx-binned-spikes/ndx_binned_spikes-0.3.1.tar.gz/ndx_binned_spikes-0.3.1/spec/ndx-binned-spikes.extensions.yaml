  doc: A data interface for binned spike data aligned to an event (e.g. a stimulus
    or the beginning of a trial).

    doc: The name of this container

    dtype: text
    value: Spikes data binned and aligned to the event timestamps of one or multiple
      conditions.
    doc: A description of what the data represents

    dtype: float64
    doc: The length in milliseconds of the bins
  - name: event_to_bin_offset_in_ms
    dtype: float64
    default_value: 0.0
    doc: The time offset from the event timestamp to the start of the first bin. Negative
      values indicate bins that start before the event; positive values indicate bins
      that start after the event.
