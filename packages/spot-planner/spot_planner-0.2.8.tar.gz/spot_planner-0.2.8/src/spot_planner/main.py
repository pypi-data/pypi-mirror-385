    Find optimal periods in a price sequence based on cost and timing constraints.

    This algorithm selects periods (indices) from a price sequence to minimize cost
    while satisfying various timing constraints. The algorithm prioritizes periods
    with prices at or below the threshold, but still respects all constraints including
    dynamic consecutive_selections calculation.

    Args:
        prices: Sequence of prices for each period. Each element represents the
               price for one time period (e.g., hourly, 15-minute intervals).
        low_price_threshold: Price threshold below/equal to which periods are
                           preferentially selected. Periods with price <= threshold
                           will be included if they can form valid consecutive runs
                           meeting the consecutive_selections constraint.
        min_selections: Minimum number of individual periods (indices) that must be
                       selected. This also represents historical heating duration
                       (higher values = more heating in past 24h).
        min_consecutive_selections: Minimum number of consecutive periods that must be
                                  selected together. The actual value will be calculated
                                  dynamically between this and max_consecutive_selections.
        max_consecutive_selections: Maximum number of consecutive periods that can be
                                  selected together. The actual value will be calculated
                                  dynamically between min_consecutive_selections and this.
        max_gap_between_periods: Maximum number of periods allowed between selected
                               periods. Controls the maximum downtime between operating
                               periods. Set to 0 to require consecutive selections only.
        max_gap_from_start: Maximum number of periods from the beginning before the
                          first selection must occur. Controls how long we can wait
                          before starting operations.

    Returns:
        List of indices representing the selected periods, sorted by index.
        The indices correspond to positions in the input prices sequence.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input parameters are invalid or no valid combination
                   can be found that satisfies all constraints.

    Examples:
        >>> prices = [Decimal('0.05'), Decimal('0.08'), Decimal('0.12'), Decimal('0.06')]
        >>> get_cheapest_periods(prices, Decimal('0.10'), 2, 1, 3, 1, 1)
        [0, 1, 3]  # Selects periods 0, 1, 3 (all <= 0.10 and form valid runs)

        [0, 1, 3]  # consecutive_selections calculated dynamically between 2-5

    Note:
        The algorithm prioritizes periods below the price threshold but respects
        all constraints. The actual consecutive_selections value is calculated dynamically:
        - If min_selections < 25% of total prices: use min_consecutive_selections
        - If min_selections > 75% of total prices: use max_consecutive_selections
