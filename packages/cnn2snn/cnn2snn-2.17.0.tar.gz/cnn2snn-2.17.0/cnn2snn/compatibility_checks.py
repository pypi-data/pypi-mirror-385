def check_model_compatibility(model):
    r"""Checks if a Keras model is compatible for cnn2snn conversion.

    This function doesn't convert the Keras model to an Akida model
    but only checks if the model design is compatible.

    Note that this function doesn't check if the model is compatible with
    Akida hardware.
    To check compatibility with a specific hardware device, convert the model
    and call `model.map` with this device as argument.

    **1. How to build a compatible Keras quantized model?**

    The following lines give details and constraints on how to build a Keras
    model compatible for the conversion to an Akida model.


    **2. General information about layers**

    An Akida layer must be seen as a block of Keras layers starting with a
    processing layer (Conv2D, SeparableConv2D,
    Dense). All blocks of Keras layers except the last block must have
    exactly one activation layer (ReLU or ActivationDiscreteRelu). Other
    optional layers can be present in a block such as a pooling layer or a
    batch normalization layer.
    Here are all the supported Keras layers for an Akida-compatible model:

    - Processing layers:

      - keras Conv2D/SeparableConv2D/Dense
      - cnn2snn QuantizedConv2D/QuantizedSeparableConv2D/QuantizedDense

    - Activation layers:

      - keras ReLU
      - cnn2snn ActivationDiscreteRelu
      - any increasing activation function (only for the last block of layers)
        such as softmax, sigmoid set as last layer. This layer must derive from
        keras.layers.Activation, and it will be removed during conversion to
        an Akida model.

    - Pooling layers:

      - MaxPool2D
      - GlobalAvgPool2D

    - BatchNormalization
    - Dropout
    - Flatten
    - Input
    - Reshape

    Example of a block of Keras layers::

              ----------
              | Conv2D |
              ----------
                  ||
                  \/
        ----------------------
        | BatchNormalization |
        ----------------------
                  ||
                  \/
             -------------
             | MaxPool2D |
             -------------
                  ||
                  \/
       --------------------------
       | ActivationDiscreteRelu |
       --------------------------


    **3. Constraints about inputs**

    An Akida model can accept two types of inputs: sparse events or 8-bit
    images. Whatever the input type, the Keras inputs must respect the
    following relation:

        input_akida = scale * input_keras + shift

    where the Akida inputs must be positive integers, the input scale must be
    a float value and the input shift must be an integer. In other words,
    scale * input_keras must be integers.

    Depending on the input type:

    - if the inputs are events (sparse), the first layer of the Keras model can
      be any processing layer. The input shift must be zero.
    - if the inputs are images, the first layer must be a Conv2D
      layer.


    **4. Constraints about layers' parameters**

    To be Akida-compatible, the Keras layers must observe the following rules:

    - all layers with the 'data_format' parameter must be 'channels_last'
    - all processing quantized layers and ActivationDiscreteRelu must have a
      valid quantization bitwidth
    - a Dense layer must have an input shape of (N,) or (1, 1, N)
    - a BatchNormalization layer must have 'axis' set to -1 (default)
    - a BatchNormalization layer cannot have negative gammas
    - Reshape layers can only be used to transform a tensor of shape (N,) to a
      tensor of shape (1, 1, N), and vice-versa
    - only one pooling layer can be used in each block
    - a MaxPool2D layer must have the same 'padding' as the corresponding
      processing quantized layer

    **5. Constraints about the order of layers**

    To be Akida-compatible, the order of Keras layers must observe the following
    rules:

    - a block of Keras layers must start with a processing quantized layer
    - where present, a BatchNormalization/GlobalAvgPool2D layer must be placed
      before the activation
    - a Flatten layer can only be used before a Dense layer
    - an Activation layer other than ReLU can only be used in the last layer
