Description
===========

This module performs **energy** and **metrics** measurements on video, for encoding and decoding.
It also provides a detailed **dataset**.

It manages the following parameters:

#. It supports the ``libx264``, ``libx265``, ``libvpx-vp9``, ``libsvtav1`` and ``vvc`` encoders.
#. Distortions are measured using the ``lpips``, ``psnr``, ``ssim`` and ``vmaf`` metrics.
#. Encoding efforts are ``fast``, ``medium`` and ``slow``.
#. It takes care about the colorspaces.
#. Iterate over different ``effort``, ``encoder``, ``mode``, ``quality``, ``threads``, ``fps``, ``resolution`` and ``pix_fmt``.
#. Energy measurements are catched with ``RAPL`` and an external wattmeter on ``grid'5000``.
#. Get the ``cpu`` and ``ram`` activity.
#. Get a full environment context, including harware and software version.
#. It support the mode (constant bitrate) ``cbr`` and (constant quality) ``vbr``.


Pipeline

Example of result
=================

Example of rate distortion curve:

.. code:: shell

    mendevi plot mendevi.db -x bitrate -y psnr -y ssim -wx profile -c encoder

Example of energy per encoder:

.. code:: shell

    mendevi plot mendevi.db -x quality -y energy -wx profile -wy mode -c encoder -m effort

Alternatives
============

#. The `MVCD database <https://github.com/cd-athena/MVCD>`_ also includes video encoding and decoding energy measurements.
#. The `COCONUT database <https://github.com/cd-athena/COCONUT>`_ also includes video decoding measurements.
#. The `VEED-dataset <https://github.com/cd-athena/VEED-dataset/tree/main>`_ offers a comprehensive LCA and GPU measurements.
#. The `CTC videos <https://dash-large-files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/ReferenceSequences/>`_ are used for the tests.
