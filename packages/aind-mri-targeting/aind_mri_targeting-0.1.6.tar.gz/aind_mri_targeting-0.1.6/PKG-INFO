## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! However, please ensure that your code adheres to the recommended DevOps practices below:

### Linting

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) as our primary linting tool.

### Testing

Attempt to add tests when new features are added.
To run the currently available tests, run `uv run pytest` from the root of the repository.

### Lock files

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage our lock files and therefore encourage everyone to use uv as a package manager as well.

### Pull requests

For internal members, please create a branch. For external members, please fork the repository and open a pull request from the fork. We'll primarily use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary) style for commit messages. Roughly, they should follow the pattern:
```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

where scope (optional) describes the packages affected by the code changes and type (mandatory) is one of:

- **build**: Changes that affect build tools or external dependencies (example scopes: pyproject.toml, setup.py)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: .github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bugfix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Semantic Release

The table below, from [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), shows which commit message gets you which release type when `semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                                    |
