# Moodley CLI
Moodley is a cross-platform command-line tool that fetches assignments from LMS and VITOL and automatically creates corresponding events in Google Calendar.

⚠️ Note: This tool is specifically designed for VIT Chennai. The LMS and VITOL integrations are tailored for this college's systems and may not work with other institutions.
If you want to use it with other Moodle-based sites, you can update the URLs in the BASE_URLS dictionary in the core.py file.

Credentials are securely stored using the system keyring, and Google OAuth handles calendar access.

## Features

* Fetch assignments from LMS and VITOL.
* Automatically create Google Calendar events for assignment deadlines.
* Secure credential storage via system keyring.
* Cross-platform support: Windows, macOS, Linux.
* Simple and intuitive CLI interface.
