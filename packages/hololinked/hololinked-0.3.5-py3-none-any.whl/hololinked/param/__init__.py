Parameters are a kind of class attribute allowing special behavior,
including dynamically generated parameter values, documentation
strings, constant and read-only parameters, and type or range checking
at assignment time.

Potentially useful for any large Python program that needs
user-modifiable object attributes; see the Parameter and Parameterized
classes for more information.  If you do not want to add a dependency
on external code by importing from a separately installed param
package, you can simply save this file as param.py and copy it and
parameterized.py directly into your own package.

This file contains subclasses of Parameter, implementing specific
parameter types (e.g. Number), and also imports the definition of
Parameters and Parameterized classes.
