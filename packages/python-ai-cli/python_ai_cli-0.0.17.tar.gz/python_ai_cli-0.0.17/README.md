The quickest way to get started is by exposing an API key from [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/u/1/apikey) (`export GEMINI_API_KEY=$YOUR_KEY`) or by pulling one of the [supported Ollama models](https://github.com/manusa/ai-cli/blob/92b559c42f0743edbaefbcd7d8b695cc81adb5f0/pkg/inference/ollama/ollama.go#L25-L29). 

### Node environment available (npm)

If you have Node.js installed, you can run the CLI directly by using `npx`:

```bash
# Show the available commands
npx npm-ai-cli@latest help
# Start a TUI-based chat session
npx npm-ai-cli@latest chat
# Discover available tools and providers
npx npm-ai-cli@latest discover
```

### Python environment available (pip)

If you have Python installed, you can run the CLI directly by using `uvx`:

```bash
# Show the available commands
uvx python-ai-cli@latest help
# Start a TUI-based chat session
uvx python-ai-cli@latest chat
# Discover available tools and providers
uvx python-ai-cli@latest discover
```

### Go (Golang) environment available

If you have Go installed, you can install the CLI by running:

```bash
go install github.com/manusa/ai-cli/cmd/ai-cli@latest
```

After installation, make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system's `PATH` to run the `ai-cli` command directly from your terminal.

```bash
# Show the available commands
ai-cli help
# Start a TUI-based chat session
ai-cli chat
# Discover available tools and providers
ai-cli discover
```

### Manual installation

You can also install the CLI manually by downloading a binary compatible with your OS from the [latest release](https://github.com/manusa/ai-cli/releases/latest).

> [!NOTE]
> For macOS users: you might need to run `xattr -rc /path/to/ai-cli` to remove the quarantine attribute.
> We're still not signing the binaries, but it's on our roadmap.
