# ferrmion

This codebase contains methods to generate qubit Hamiltonians from fermionic Hamiltonians.


## Interop

Most quantum SDKs will have methods to convert common python types to native objects, so it's usually possible to create an operator using the `.edge_operator` and `number_operator` functions of a `FermionQubitEncoding`.

Please open an issue or pull request on github if you would like to suggest a documented interop.

### Qiskit
`ferrmion` provides a method to convert its narive encoding class `FermionQubitencoding` to a `qiskit_nature.QubitMapper`.

To use this feature, you'll need to install optional dependencies with:
```
pip install ferrmion[qiskit]
```

For more details, see the [interop documentation](https://ferrmion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interop/).



## Encodings
- Ternary Tree encodings

    Any ternary tree can be generated by adding nodes to a tree structure, and functions exist to easily create standard encodings including: Jordan-Wigner, Parity, Bravyi-Kitaev and JKMN

- MaxNTO encodings

    A non-ternary-tree majorana string encoding with the maximal non-trivial overlap possible.
    Only works for systems with even numbers of modes (i.e. all spin-orbit Hamiltonians)
