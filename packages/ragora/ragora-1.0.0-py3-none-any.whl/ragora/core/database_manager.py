"""Database management layer for RAG system using Weaviate.

This module provides the DatabaseManager class that handles low-level
database operations and connection management. It serves as the
infrastructure layer that both VectorStore and Retriever use for
database access.

Key responsibilities:
- Initialize and manage Weaviate client connections
- Provide collection access and management
- Handle connection testing and health checks
- Manage database schema operations
- Provide clean abstraction over Weaviate client operations

The DatabaseManager focuses solely on infrastructure concerns,
allowing higher layers to focus on business logic.
