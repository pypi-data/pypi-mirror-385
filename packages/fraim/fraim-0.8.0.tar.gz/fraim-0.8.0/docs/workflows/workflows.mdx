This guide covers Fraim's security analysis workflows, how they work, and how to customize or create new workflows for your specific security needs.

## Overview

Workflows in Fraim are AI-powered analysis pipelines that examine different aspects of your codebase for security vulnerabilities and configuration issues. Each workflow is specialized for specific types of analysis and file formats.

## Available Workflows

### Code Security Analysis

**Status:** ✅ Available
**Workflow ID:** `code`

The code security analysis workflow examines source code files for common security vulnerabilities using AI-powered static analysis.

#### Supported Languages

- **Python** (`.py`) - Complete support
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (`.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`) - Complete support
- **Java** (`.java`) - Complete support
- **C/C++** (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`) - Complete support
- **Go** (`.go`) - Complete support
- **Ruby** (`.rb`) - Complete support
- **PHP** (`.php`) - Complete support
- **Swift** (`.swift`) - Complete support
- **Rust** (`.rs`) - Complete support
- **Kotlin** (`.kt`) - Complete support
- **Scala** (`.scala`) - Complete support

#### Vulnerability Categories

The code workflow detects various security issues:

**Injection Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- Command Injection
- LDAP Injection
- XPath Injection

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM-based XSS

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Authorization bypasses
- Session management flaws
- Insecure password storage

**Data Exposure:**
- Sensitive data in logs
- Hardcoded secrets
- Information disclosure
- Unencrypted sensitive data

**Input Validation:**
- Insufficient input validation
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- File upload vulnerabilities
- Deserialization flaws

**Configuration Issues:**
- Insecure default configurations
- Debug mode enabled in production
- Weak cryptographic algorithms
- Insufficient error handling

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic code analysis
fraim code --location .

# Python-focused analysis
fraim code --location . --globs "*.py"

# High-confidence findings only
fraim --confidence 9 code --location .
```

### Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Analysis

**Status:** ✅ Available
**Workflow ID:** `iac`

The IAC workflow analyzes infrastructure configuration files for security misconfigurations and compliance violations.

#### Supported Formats (Planned)

- **Terraform** (`.tf`, `.tfvars`) - In development
- **Kubernetes** (`.yaml`, `.yml`) - In development
- **Docker** (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) - In development
- **AWS CloudFormation** (`.json`, `.yaml`) - Planned
- **Azure ARM Templates** (`.json`) - Planned
- **Ansible** (`.yml`, `.yaml`) - Planned

#### Detection Categories (Planned)

**Cloud Security:**
- Overly permissive IAM policies
- Unencrypted storage
- Public access to private resources
- Missing security groups

**Container Security:**
- Running as root user
- Exposed secrets in environment variables
- Vulnerable base images
- Missing security contexts

**Network Security:**
- Open security groups
- Unencrypted traffic
- Missing network policies
- Insecure load balancer configurations

## Workflow Architecture

### How Workflows Work

1. **File Discovery**: Workflows scan for files matching their configured patterns
2. **Chunking**: Large files are split into manageable chunks for analysis
3. **AI Analysis**: Each chunk is analyzed by the configured AI model
4. **Result Processing**: Findings are validated and formatted
5. **Report Generation**: Results are compiled into SARIF and HTML reports

### Workflow Components

Each workflow consists of:

- **Configuration**: File patterns, analysis parameters, and settings
- **Prompts**: AI prompts optimized for specific security analysis tasks
- **Processors**: Code to handle file parsing and result processing
- **Validators**: Logic to filter and validate findings
