    This method is taken directly from the original generated code in `api`,
    with the duplicate name logic commented out. This change ensures that GraphQL
    variables like `includeDeleted` are preserved with stable names across nested
    resources (e.g., when querying `program` from within `target`).

    The original implementation aggressively renamed variables to avoid duplicates,
    which inadvertently dropped shared variables or renamed them inconsistently-
    breaking propagation in nested structures. This patch ensures consistent naming
    by avoiding unnecessary renaming, allowing shared variables to work as expected.
    We are not aware of any issues caused by this patch.

    This is not in use right now, a relic of a patch before the real issue was
    discovered. Holding onto this until further testing concludes this is not needed.

    The generated client missed variables that were declared deep inside the
    field tree. It only kept the variables that belonged to each direct child
    node. If a nested field, for example program(includeDeleted) inside
    targets, added its own variable, the query referenced that variable but the
    accompanying variables payload did not include a value. The server then
    returned an error saying the variable was undefined.

    This patch replaces the method with one that walks through every level of
    the field tree, gathers the variables from every sub-field and inline
    fragment, and returns them in a single flat dictionary. With every value
    now present in the payload, the undefined-variable error is resolved.
