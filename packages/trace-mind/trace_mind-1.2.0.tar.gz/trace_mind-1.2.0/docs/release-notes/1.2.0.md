# TraceMind 1.2.0

Released on 2024-08-XX

## Highlights

### Engine Abstraction & ProcessEngine
- Added `PythonEngine` wrapper while keeping existing CLI behaviour intact.
- Introduced `ProcessEngine` (JSON-RPC over stdio) plus a mock executor for contract tests.
- Runtime configuration (`runtime.yaml`) and CLI overrides (`--engine`, `--executor-path`) control engine selection.

### Flow IR & Verification Pipeline
- `tm dsl compile --emit-ir` now emits per-flow `.ir.json` and `manifest.json` validated against `docs/ir/v0.1/schema.json`.
- New IR runner (`tm.runtime.run_ir_flow`) executes flows via the selected engine; smoke tests run flows against both Python and mock process engines.
- Added `tm runtime run` CLI command for direct IR execution.
- Added `tm verify online` to optionally recompile sources and run flows using the configured engine, supporting both offline and online verification workflows.

### Documentation & Tooling
- New runtime guide (`docs/runtime.md`) describing engines, IR artifacts, and verification commands.
- README highlights AI guidance layer, formal logic pipeline, and multi-runtime execution, with updated architecture diagram.
- Smoke suites ensure CLI and ProcessEngine behaviour (`tests/smoke_proc`, `tests/dsl/test_cli_verify.py`).

## Upgrade Notes

- Ensure `tm dsl compile --emit-ir` is run before using `tm runtime run` or `tm verify online` so manifests and IR files exist.
- ProcessEngine requires an executor binary implementing REP v0.1; provide its path via `runtime.yaml` or `--executor-path`.
- `jsonschema>=4.10` is now a dependency for IR validation (fallback validator included for offline environments).

## Thanks
Thanks to everyone who tested the new runtime abstraction, verified REP contracts, and provided feedback on the docs and CLI workflow.
