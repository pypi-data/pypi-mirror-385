### Introduction:
The module was developed for use at IPF Dresden as a tool to extract data via REST from
ovens manufactured by Memmert. The python module implements the Memmert REST API *AtmoWeb*.
The here published module was tested with a Memmert UF55 plus oven.<p>
Before working with this software please refer to the AtmoWeb documentation of the REST interface from Memmert at:

An uptodate version of the module documented in this readme can be found at the following IPF GitLab repository:<p>

If you encounter problems while using this software or have ideas for enhancing it, please feel free

### Setup:

#### Networkconfiguration:
To establish a connection the oven needs to be connected via Ethernet to the computer running the software.
The ethernet adapter of the computer needs to be configured for IPv4 without DHCP / static ip addresses.

1) Find out the IP address and subnet mask of the oven. You can find it inside the "Settings" menu at the oven itself.
It might be somthing like: <p>"192.168.100.100" / "255.255.0.0"


2) Navigate to the IPv4 settings of the network adapter on your computer and configure it like in the following example:<p>
**IP:         192.168.5.2**<p>
**Gateway:    192.168.5.1**<p>
**Subnet:     255.255.0.0**<p>
**leave DHCP empty**

Please ashore a working connection before using the module!
A connection to the oven can be verified by trying to ping the ip address of the oven.

#### Python:
To work with the module use Python 3.10 or newer. The module relies on the following packages that can be installed
using pip.
- requests
- json
- logging

Locate the pyAtmoWeb.py file in the root folder of your python script.
Use the module as in the following:<p>

```
import time
import pyAtmoWeb as paw

ip_address = "192.168.100.100"

for i in range(0, 9):
    print(paw.get_temp_1(ip_address))
    time.sleep(1)
```
