# Changelog

## v0.9.2

- feat(agent): cache instructions in Agent class and Developer message for the providers that supports it (cache ephemeral)


## v0.9.1

### üéØ **Pricing Integration**
- **feat(generations)**: Added `Pricing` model to `Generation` class with `input_pricing`, `output_pricing`, and `total_pricing` fields
- **feat(providers)**: All major providers now automatically populate pricing information in `Generation` objects
  - OpenRouter: Dynamic pricing from API with automatic per-token to per-million conversion
  - OpenAI: Static pricing table with comprehensive model coverage
  - Google (Gemini): Static pricing for all Gemini models
  - Cerebras: Static pricing for Llama models
  - Amazon Bedrock: Static pricing for Claude and other models
- **feat(adapters)**: Added async `adapt_async()` methods to all provider adapters for pricing calculation
- **fix(openrouter)**: Corrected pricing calculation - OpenRouter returns per-token prices, now properly converted to per-million-tokens
- Pricing is calculated using the abstract methods `price_per_million_tokens_input()` and `price_per_million_tokens_output()`
- Costs are rounded to 8 decimal places for precision
- Graceful fallback to empty `Pricing` object if calculation fails

### üêõ **Bug Fixes**
- fix(openrouter): when fallback models are used, use "models" in the requests, not "model"
- fix(openrouter): accept single string in `with_fallback_models()` method (was treating string as iterable)

### üö® **Error Handling**
- feat(openrouter): comprehensive custom exception hierarchy with detailed error messages
  - Created 16+ custom exception classes for all documented OpenRouter errors
  - Each exception includes clear descriptions, possible causes, and actionable solutions
  - Automatic error parsing from response status codes and error messages
  - Examples: `ModelNotFoundError`, `InsufficientCreditsError`, `ContextLengthExceededError`, etc.
  - See `examples/openrouter_error_handling.py` for usage examples
