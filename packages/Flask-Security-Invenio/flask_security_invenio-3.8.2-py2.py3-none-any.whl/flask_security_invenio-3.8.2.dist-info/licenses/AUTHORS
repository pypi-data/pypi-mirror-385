Flask-Security is was original written and maintained by Matt Wright and various contributors.

Invenio Framework has used Flask-Security since 2015 and CERN has contributed with both features and maintenance. The project have throughout all the years had issues with continued maintenance, and a solution has finally been found
with Flask-Security-Too.

Invenio Framework however does not need the advanced features introduced in Flask-Security-Too, and some changes made the migration path quite hard. We have thus decided to maintain a reduced fork of Flask-Security that was forked of from v3.0.2 of Flask-Security-Too.
