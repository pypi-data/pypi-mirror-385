        Prepares the resolvers by dynamically associating methods in the class with

        This method iterates over all methods in the class that have names starting
        with 'solve_req_' or 'solve_res_'. It checks the signature of each method to
        ensure that its parameter is named 'event' and is a subclass of the `Event`
        dataclass. Based on the method's prefix, it associates the method with either
        a request or response handler in the `_requests` or `_responses` dictionaries
        respectively.

        Raises:
         AttributeError: If the parameter of the method is not named 'event'

        Methods:
         - `get_event(sig: Signature) -> Type[Event]`: Extracts and validates the event
             parameter from the method's signature. Ensures that the event parameter is
             named 'event' and is a subclass of the `Event` dataclass.

         - `methods_name`: A generator expression that yields method names starting with
             'solve_req_' or 'solve_res_'.

        Workflow:
         1. The method iterates over all the method names in the class that start with
            'solve_req_' or 'solve_res_'.
         2. For each method, it checks if it is a valid instance method. If not, it logs
            a warning message and continues to the next method.
         3. For valid methods, it retrieves the `event` type by calling `get_event()`
            with the method's signature.
         4. If the method name starts with 'solve_req_', it associates the method with
            the event type in the `_requests` dictionary.
         5. If the method name starts with 'solve_res_', it associates the method with
            the event type in the `_responses` dictionary.

        Attributes:
         - `_requests`: A dictionary that stores request handler methods, keyed by event type.
         - `_responses`: A dictionary that stores response handler methods, keyed by event type.
         - `logger`: A logging object used to log warnings for methods that do not meet

        Finds and returns the worker associated with a given pipe. This method iterates through all registered

        both the identifier of the worker and the worker instance itself.

        Parameters:
            pipe (Connection): The communication pipe to match with a worker. This is used to identify the specific
                               worker associated with the given communication channel.

        Parameters:
            router_queue (Optional[Queue[Event]]): The event queue used for communication with the router. If provided,
                                                   this queue will be set as the current router queue for the manager.
                                                   This queue is essential for the manager to receive and process events.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: Raised if no router queue is provided and no router queue has been set previously. This
                          exception ensures that the manager cannot start without a means to communicate with the
                          router, as the lack of a router queue would prevent the manager from functioning correctly.

        Note:
            If a router queue is not provided as an argument to this method, the manager will attempt to use a
            previously set router queue. It's essential to either provide a router queue when calling this method
            or set one before its execution. Failure to do so will result in a RuntimeError, indicating the
            manager's inability to start due to the absence of a communication channel with the router.

        Example:
            To start the manager, you may either provide a router queue directly when calling the start method
            or ensure that the manager has a router queue set beforehand. This flexibility allows for different
            use cases, such as reusing an existing queue or setting a new one as needed.
