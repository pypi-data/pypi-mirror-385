class EventHandlingType(IntFlag):
    """
    IntFlag representing different modes of event handling in the system.

    The `EventHandlingType` IntFlag categorizes the ways in which events are handled
    and dispatched to clients in the API broker system. Each mode defines a distinct
    strategy for event delivery, ensuring that events reach their intended recipients
    based on the specified criteria. With IntFlag, multiple modes can be combined
    using bitwise operations.

    Attributes:
        SPECIFIC (int): Handles an event in a 1:1 fashion, responding directly to the
        client that requested it. This mode ensures that the event is sent only to
        the client whose request triggered the event. Events in this mode are created
        exclusively by API handlers to fulfill specific client requests.

            Example APIs: Typically used for REST or HTML requests where a client
            makes a direct request, and the server provides a direct response.

        SUBSCRIBED (int): Sends the event exclusively to clients who have registered
        their interest by subscribing to this event type. This mode is used for
        events meant to notify or update only a specific subset of clients.

            Example APIs: Suitable for APIs with asynchronous capabilities, such as
            WebSocket or MQTT, where clients subscribe to events and receive
            notifications asynchronously.

        ALL (int): Broadcasts the event to all clients connected to the system capable
        of receiving asynchronous events, regardless of their specific subscription status.
        This mode does not limit the broadcast to only those who subscribed to a specific type.

            Example APIs: Similar to `SUBSCRIBED`, this mode applies to protocols like
            WebSocket or MQTT, but the event is sent to all clients, not just those
            subscribed to a specific type.

    Combinations:
        SPECIFIC|SUBSCRIBED (int): A flexible mode of event handling where the event can either
        be a direct 1:1 response to a client's request or be broadcasted to all clients
        subscribed to that event type. The handling behavior is determined by the context
        in which the event is created. If the event originates from a REST request or similar,
        it might behave like a SPECIFIC event. If generated internally as part of core logic,
        it might be broadcast to subscribers.

            Example APIs: Can be used for REST or HTML requests but also applies to
            asynchronous protocols like WebSocket or MQTT where clients can subscribe
            to specific events.

        SPECIFIC|ALL (int): Similar to `SPECIFIC|SUBSCRIBED`, but with a broader scope.
        The event can either be sent as a direct response to the specific client that
        requested it or broadcasted to all clients capable of receiving events,
        regardless of their subscription status. The handling behavior is determined
        by the event's context â€” it is either specific or for all, but it cannot be both
        at the same time.

            Example APIs: Applies to REST, HTML, WebSocket, or MQTT. The event could either
            act like a direct response to a client request or be broadcast to every client,
            but not both simultaneously.
