# CovetPy - Core Runtime Dependencies
# ====================================
#
# Sprint 1 Remediation: Updated dependencies with security fixes
# Version: 0.2.0-sprint1
# Updated: 2025-10-11
#
# CORE PHILOSOPHY: Minimal runtime dependencies
# Only the essential packages required for the core framework to function
#
# For development dependencies, see requirements-dev.txt
# For testing dependencies, see requirements-test.txt
# For security tools, see requirements-security.txt

# Core Dependencies (Essential)
# ==============================
pydantic>=2.12.0,<3.0.0           # Data validation and settings management
prometheus-client>=0.23.1,<1.0.0  # Metrics and monitoring
psutil>=7.1.0,<8.0.0              # System and process utilities

# ASGI Server (Production deployment)
# ====================================
uvicorn[standard]>=0.37.0,<1.0.0  # High-performance ASGI server

# Database Drivers (Optional - install as needed)
# ================================================
# Uncomment the database drivers you need:
# asyncpg>=0.30.0,<1.0.0          # PostgreSQL async driver
# aiomysql>=0.2.0,<1.0.0          # MySQL async driver
# aiosqlite>=0.19.0,<1.0.0        # SQLite async driver

# Security Dependencies (REQUIRED for security features)
# ========================================================
# SECURITY FIX: Replaced pycryptodome with cryptography (Sprint 1 - CRITICAL-SEC-001)
cryptography>=41.0.0,<50.0.0      # Modern cryptographic operations (replaces deprecated PyCrypto)
# SECURITY FIX: Removed python-jose (unused, causes ecdsa CVE-2024-23342) - code uses PyJWT instead
passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4,<2.0.0     # Secure password hashing
pyotp>=2.9.0,<3.0.0               # TOTP/HOTP for MFA
qrcode[pil]>=7.4.2,<8.0.0         # QR code generation for MFA

# Caching (Optional)
# ===================
# cachetools>=5.3.0,<6.0.0        # Caching utilities

# NOTE: This represents the MINIMAL runtime dependencies for CovetPy
# For a full-featured installation, use: pip install covetpy[full]
