## Performance

### Honest Assessment

**Note**: CovetPy focuses on **education**, not maximum performance. These are estimates, NOT comprehensive benchmarks.

#### Component Performance (Estimated)
```
Routing:        ~800k ops/sec    (Sub-microsecond)
JSON Parsing:   ~24k ops/sec     (stdlib)
JSON Encoding:  ~16k ops/sec     (stdlib)
HTTP Parsing:   ~750k ops/sec    (custom)
```

#### Framework Comparison (Rough Estimates)
```
FastAPI:    ~20-50k req/s  →  CovetPy: ~5-15k req/s (estimate)
Flask:      ~5-15k req/s   →  CovetPy: ~5-10k req/s (estimate)
Django:     ~3-8k req/s    →  CovetPy: ~8-12k req/s (estimate)
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- These are rough estimates for educational purposes
- No comprehensive benchmarks performed
- For production, use battle-tested frameworks
