## Risk Management Strategy

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Monitoring |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **Performance Regression** | Medium | High | Weekly benchmarking against FastAPI | Automated performance testing |
| **Security Vulnerability** | Low | Critical | Security-first development, regular audits | Continuous security scanning |
| **Integration Complexity** | High | Medium | Modular architecture, extensive testing | Daily integration tests |
| **Resource Constraints** | Medium | High | Parallel development, external expertise | Weekly resource planning |

### Risk Response Procedures

**Performance Issues:**
1. Immediate performance profiling and bottleneck identification
2. Emergency optimization sprint if performance drops >25%
3. Rollback procedures for performance-critical changes

**Security Issues:**
1. Emergency security patch process within 24 hours
2. External security audit at each sprint completion
3. Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

**Integration Issues:**
1. Daily smoke tests across all integration points
2. Rollback procedures for breaking integration changes
3. Dedicated integration testing environment

This comprehensive sprint plan provides the roadmap to transform CovetPy into a production-ready web framework that can compete with FastAPI and Flask. Success depends on disciplined execution, continuous integration with real backend systems, and maintaining focus on performance and security throughout the development process.

The plan emphasizes **real backend integration** at every level - from database connections to authentication systems to performance monitoring - ensuring that the framework is built and tested against actual production environments rather than mock implementations.
