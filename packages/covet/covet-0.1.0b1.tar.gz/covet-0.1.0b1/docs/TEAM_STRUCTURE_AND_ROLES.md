## PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Team Metrics

**Sprint Velocity:**
- Target: 200-250 story points per sprint (full team)
- Measured weekly, trend tracked
- Adjustment for team ramp-up

**Code Quality:**
- Test coverage: Must maintain 80%+
- Security vulnerabilities: Zero critical, <5 high
- Code review turnaround: <24 hours average
- Technical debt ratio: <5%

**Deployment Metrics:**
- Deployment frequency: Daily (after Month 6)
- Change failure rate: <15%
- Mean time to recovery: <1 hour
- Lead time for changes: <1 day

### Individual Metrics

**Engineers:**
- Story point completion rate: 85%+
- Code quality score: 8.5/10+
- PR review participation: 10+ per week
- Test coverage on PRs: 80%+

**Not Measured (Avoid Micromanagement):**

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Key Person Risk

**Problem:** Loss of technical lead or critical engineer.

**Mitigation:**
- Cross-training: Every component has 2+ knowledgeable engineers
- Documentation: Architecture decisions and critical systems documented
- Backup leadership: Senior engineers can step up temporarily
- Recruitment pipeline: Always have warm candidates

### Team Velocity Risk

**Problem:** Team not achieving target velocity.

**Mitigation:**
- Monthly velocity reviews with adjustment
- Pair programming for knowledge transfer
- Process optimization retrospectives
- Hire additional contractors if needed (budget reserve)

### Knowledge Silos

**Problem:** Critical knowledge held by single person.

**Mitigation:**
- Required documentation for all major features
- Pair programming rotation
- Lunch-and-learn sessions (weekly)
- Code review requirements ensure knowledge sharing
