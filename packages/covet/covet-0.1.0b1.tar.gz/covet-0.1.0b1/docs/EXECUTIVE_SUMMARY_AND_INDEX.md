- [ ] Medium team (4-5 people)
- [ ] Moderate risk tolerance
- [ ] Target niche market
- [ ] 3-month timeline acceptable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

### DO NOT Proceed Without:
1. ‚ùå Choosing strategic path (Educational, Production, or MVP)
2. ‚ùå Budget approval
3. ‚ùå Team hiring plan approved
4. ‚ùå Timeline commitment (4, 9, or 3 months)
5. ‚ùå Quality gate acceptance

### DO NOT Claim:
1. ‚ùå "Zero dependencies" (uses 23+ libraries)
2. ‚ùå "750K RPS" (actual: ~50K RPS)
3. ‚ùå "200x faster than FastAPI" (actual: maybe 1.7x)
4. ‚ùå "Production ready" (35% complete)
5. ‚ùå "Enterprise database support" (8% complete)

### DO Acknowledge:
1. ‚úÖ Experimental/educational status
2. ‚úÖ 35% complete (65% gap)
3. ‚úÖ Not production ready
4. ‚úÖ Security vulnerabilities exist
5. ‚úÖ Performance claims were exaggerated
