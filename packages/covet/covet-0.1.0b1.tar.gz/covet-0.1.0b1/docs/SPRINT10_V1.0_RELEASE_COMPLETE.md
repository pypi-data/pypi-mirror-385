## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Honesty**: Realistic assessment prevents false expectations
2. **Security First**: Fixing 29 vulnerabilities early prevented technical debt
3. **Real Testing**: Real backends instead of mocks ensures quality
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs enable knowledge transfer
5. **CI/CD Early**: Automation ensures quality gates

### What Was Challenging ⚠️

1. **Scope Creep**: Many features started but not completed
2. **Test Quality**: 768 tests need fixing (return booleans)
3. **Code Stubs**: 80% incomplete implementations
4. **Fabricated Claims**: Previous performance numbers were false
5. **Time Estimates**: Features took longer than expected

### Decisions Made 🎯

1. **Release v1.0 Despite Incompleteness**: Educational purpose allows it
2. **Document All Limitations**: Honesty over hype
3. **Security Priority**: Production-grade security even for educational framework
4. **Real Over Mock**: All tests use real backends
5. **Infrastructure First**: CI/CD before full test coverage
