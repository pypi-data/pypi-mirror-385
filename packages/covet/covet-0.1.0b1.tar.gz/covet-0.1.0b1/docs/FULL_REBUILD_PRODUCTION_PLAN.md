## 🚀 QUICK START FOR DEVELOPERS

### Current Working Features
```python
# 1. HTTP Server (WORKS!)
from covet import Covet
app = Covet()

@app.route('/')
async def index(request):
    return {'status': 'working'}

# 2. ORM (WORKS!)
from covet.orm import Database, Model, CharField

db = Database('sqlite:///app.db')

class User(Model):
    name = CharField(max_length=100)
    class Meta:
        db = db

db.create_tables([User])
user = User(name='Alice')
user.save()
```

### Testing Current Build
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/covetpy/covet
cd covet

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run examples
python examples/quickstart.py
python examples/orm_quickstart.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

## 📝 KEY DECISIONS

### Technology Choices
- **No Kubernetes**: Direct PyPI distribution only
- **Sync-first ORM**: Like Django, not async-only
- **Flask-like API**: Simple decorators, not class-based
- **Minimal dependencies**: Core features built-in

### Distribution Strategy
- **PyPI primary**: `pip install covet`
- **No Docker required**: Pure Python package
- **No cloud deployment**: Framework only
- **Documentation on GitHub**: Not separate site initially

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| More broken features found | High | Incremental testing |
| PyPI name taken | Medium | Alternative: covetpy |
| Performance issues | Medium | Benchmark early |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Audit before release |
| Low adoption | Medium | Good documentation |

## 🎉 CONCLUSION

CovetPy is undergoing a complete rebuild from a broken state to a production-ready web framework. With the core HTTP server and ORM now working, we have a solid foundation. The focus is on simplicity, reliability, and ease of distribution through PyPI.

**Next Immediate Actions**:
1. Complete authentication system (Week 3)
2. Build migration system (Week 4)
3. Test PyPI package build
4. Create more examples
5. Write user documentation

**The goal**: Make `pip install covet` give developers a simple, working web framework comparable to Flask but with modern async capabilities and built-in ORM.

**Status**: Week 2 Complete, Week 3 Starting
**Progress**: 12.5% Complete (2/16 weeks)
**Confidence**: Medium (core working, but much work ahead)
