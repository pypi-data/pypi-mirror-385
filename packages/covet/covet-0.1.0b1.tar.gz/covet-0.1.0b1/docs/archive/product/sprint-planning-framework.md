4. **Plan contingency approaches for critical path items**

#### In-Sprint Risk Monitoring
1. **Daily standup risk check**: Any new risks or risk status changes
2. **Mid-sprint risk review**: Assess risk mitigation effectiveness
3. **Risk escalation**: Clear criteria for escalating risks to management

#### Risk Response Strategies

- **Accept**: Acknowledge risk and plan response
- **Transfer**: Engage other teams or external resources
