## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Scripts

### Coverage Tracking
```bash
# Track coverage progress over time
python scripts/track_coverage_progress.py

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html

# Run specific module tests
pytest tests/security/ --cov=src/covet/security --cov-report=html
```

### Quick Checks
```bash
# Count test collection errors
pytest tests/ --collect-only 2>&1 | grep ERROR | wc -l

# Find untested files
grep -r "0%" htmlcov/index.html

# Check coverage by module
python -c "import json; data=json.load(open('coverage.json')); print({k.split('/')[2]: v['summary']['percent_covered'] for k,v in data['files'].items() if 'covet' in k})"
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can we deploy to production now?**
A: ‚ùå **NO.** With 17.3% coverage and critical security modules untested, deployment would be extremely risky.

**Q: What's the minimum coverage for production?**
A: üéØ **80%+ overall, 95%+ for security/auth modules.** Current status is far below this threshold.

**Q: How long until we can deploy safely?**
A: ‚è±Ô∏è **Minimum 2 weeks** for quick wins (25% coverage), **8-10 weeks** for safe production deployment (80%+ coverage).

**Q: What if we only fix the critical issues?**
A: üî¥ Even with critical fixes (Sprint 1-3), you'd have 45% coverage. This is better but still risky. Target 80%+.

**Q: Can we parallelize the work?**
A: ‚úÖ **YES.** With 2 QA engineers, timeline reduces from 16 weeks to 8-10 weeks.

**Q: What's the ROI on this testing investment?**
A: üí∞ **High ROI.** Prevents incidents that could cost 10-100x more:
- Data breach response: $50k-$500k+
- Customer churn: Revenue loss
- Security audit failures: Compliance costs
- Reputation damage: Priceless
