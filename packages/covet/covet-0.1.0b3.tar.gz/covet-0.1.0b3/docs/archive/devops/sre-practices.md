## SRE Philosophy and Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Reliability is the most important feature** - Without reliability, features don't matter
2. **Users define reliability** - Reliability is measured from the user's perspective
3. **100% reliability is the wrong target** - Perfect reliability is impossible and expensive
4. **Change is inevitable** - Embrace change while maintaining reliability
5. **Measure everything** - Make decisions based on data, not assumptions
6. **Automate toil away** - Reduce manual, repetitive work through automation

### SRE vs Traditional Operations

| Aspect | Traditional Ops | SRE |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| Approach | Reactive | Proactive |
| Error handling | Minimize incidents | Accept controlled failure |
| Change velocity | Stability over speed | Balance reliability and velocity |
| Metrics | Infrastructure-focused | User-focused |
| Process | Manual processes | Automation-first |

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Defined SLOs for CovetPy

#### API Availability SLO
- **Target**: 99.9% availability over 30 days
- **Measurement**: Percentage of successful HTTP responses (status codes 200-299, 400-499)
- **Measurement window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Alert threshold**: 99.5% (early warning)

#### API Latency SLO
- **Target**: 95% of requests complete within 500ms
- **Measurement**: P95 latency of HTTP requests
- **Measurement window**: 5-minute rolling window  
- **Alert threshold**: P95 > 750ms

#### Database Query Performance SLO
- **Target**: 99% of database queries complete within 100ms
- **Measurement**: P99 latency of database operations
- **Measurement window**: 5-minute rolling window
- **Alert threshold**: P99 > 200ms

#### Data Processing SLO
- **Target**: 95% of background jobs complete within SLA
- **Measurement**: Job completion time vs. SLA per job type
- **Measurement window**: 1-hour rolling window
- **Alert threshold**: 90% job SLA compliance

### SLO Configuration

```yaml
# prometheus-slo-rules.yml
groups:
  - name: covet-slo-rules
    rules:
      # API Availability SLO
      - record: covet:sli_api_availability_rate5m
        expr: >
          (
            sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="covet", code!~"5.."}[5m])) 
            / 
            sum(rate(http_requests_total{job="covet"}[5m]))
          )
      
      - record: covet:sli_api_availability_rate30d
        expr: >
          avg_over_time(covet:sli_api_availability_rate5m[30d])
      
      # API Latency SLO
      - record: covet:sli_api_latency_p95_5m
        expr: >
          histogram_quantile(0.95, 
            sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job="covet"}[5m])) by (le)
          )
      
      # Database Query Performance SLO
      - record: covet:sli_db_latency_p99_5m
        expr: >
          histogram_quantile(0.99,
            sum(rate(db_query_duration_seconds_bucket{job="covet"}[5m])) by (le)
          )
```

## Error Budgets

### Error Budget Calculation

```
Error Budget = (1 - SLO) Ã— Total Time Period
```

#### Monthly Error Budgets

| Service | SLO | Error Budget (monthly) | Downtime Allowed |
|---------|-----|----------------------|------------------|
| API | 99.9% | 0.1% | 43.8 minutes |
| Database | 99.95% | 0.05% | 21.9 minutes |
| Background Jobs | 95% | 5% | 36 hours |

### Error Budget Policy

1. **Budget Available (>50%)**: 
   - Full velocity deployment
   - New feature releases allowed
   - Experimental features enabled

2. **Budget Depleted (10-50%)**:
   - Reduce deployment frequency
   - Focus on reliability improvements
   - Pause non-critical features

3. **Budget Exhausted (<10%)**:
   - Freeze all releases except critical fixes
   - Dedicate full team to reliability
   - Implement emergency response procedures

### Error Budget Monitoring

```yaml
# error-budget-alerts.yml
groups:
  - name: error-budget-alerts
    rules:
      # API Error Budget Alert
      - alert: APIErrorBudgetHigh
        expr: >
          (1 - covet:sli_api_availability_rate30d) > 0.0005
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          service: api
        annotations:
          summary: "API error budget consumption is high"
          description: "API availability SLO error budget is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} consumed"
      
      - alert: APIErrorBudgetCritical
        expr: >
          (1 - covet:sli_api_availability_rate30d) > 0.0009
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
          service: api
        annotations:
          summary: "API error budget nearly exhausted"
          description: "API availability SLO error budget is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} consumed - implement release freeze"
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Four Golden Signals

1. **Latency**: Time to process requests
2. **Traffic**: Rate of requests
3. **Errors**: Rate of failed requests
4. **Saturation**: Resource utilization

### Alert Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Service down, data loss | Immediate | Page on-call |
| **P1 - High** | Major functionality impaired | 15 minutes | Email + Slack |
| **P2 - Medium** | Minor functionality impaired | 1 hour | Slack only |
| **P3 - Low** | Potential future problems | Next business day | Ticket only |

## Toil Reduction

### Toil Identification

Toil characteristics:
- **Manual**: Requires human intervention
- **Repetitive**: Same steps performed repeatedly
- **Automatable**: Can be automated away
- **Tactical**: Reactive rather than strategic
- **No enduring value**: Doesn't improve system
- **Grows with service**: Scales linearly with service growth

### Toil Inventory

| Task | Frequency | Time (min) | Monthly Toil | Automation Priority |
|------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Manual deployments | 50/month | 30 | 25 hours | High |
| Log analysis | 20/month | 45 | 15 hours | Medium |
| Certificate renewal | 4/month | 60 | 4 hours | High |
| Database maintenance | 8/month | 90 | 12 hours | Medium |
| Alert investigation | 100/month | 15 | 25 hours | High |

### Automation Initiatives

1. **Deployment Automation**
   ```yaml
   # Fully automated GitOps deployment
   # Zero manual intervention required
   ```

2. **Self-Healing Systems**
   ```python
   # Automated recovery from common failures
   # Proactive issue detection and resolution
   ```

3. **Intelligent Alerting**
   ```yaml
   # Context-aware alerts with suggested remediation
   # Automated alert correlation and de-duplication
   ```

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Component | RTO | RPO | Recovery Strategy |
|-----------|-----|-----|------------------|
| API Service | 15 minutes | 5 minutes | Multi-region deployment |
| Database | 30 minutes | 1 minute | Automated failover |
| File Storage | 1 hour | 15 minutes | Cross-region replication |
| Monitoring | 5 minutes | 1 minute | Independent infrastructure |

### Disaster Recovery Procedures

#### Database Failover
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# database-failover.sh

# 1. Stop application traffic
kubectl scale deployment covet-app --replicas=0

# 2. Promote read replica to primary
aws rds promote-read-replica --db-instance-identifier covet-replica

# 3. Update connection strings
kubectl patch configmap covet-config --patch '{"data":{"db_host":"new-primary-endpoint"}}'

# 4. Restart application
kubectl scale deployment covet-app --replicas=3

# 5. Verify health
kubectl rollout status deployment/covet-app
```

#### Cross-Region Failover
```yaml
# disaster-recovery-runbook.yml
steps:
  1. "Assess impact and declare disaster"
  2. "Activate DR team and communication channels"
  3. "Redirect traffic to DR region using Route53"
  4. "Activate standby infrastructure in DR region"
  5. "Restore data from latest backups"
  6. "Verify system functionality"
  7. "Communicate status to stakeholders"
  8. "Monitor system stability"
  9. "Plan primary region recovery"
```

### Backup Strategy

```yaml
# backup-configuration.yml
databases:
  primary:
    frequency: "continuous"
    retention: "30 days"
    cross_region: true
    encryption: true
