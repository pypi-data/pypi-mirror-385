# CovetPy Feature Prioritization Matrix

## RICE Scoring Framework

**RICE** stands for **Reach**, **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Effort**. Each feature is scored on these dimensions to calculate a priority score.

### Scoring Methodology

#### Reach (People impacted per quarter)
- **3**: 10K+ users/deployments per quarter
- **2**: 1K-10K users/deployments per quarter  
- **1**: 100-1K users/deployments per quarter
- **0.5**: <100 users/deployments per quarter

#### Impact (Impact per person reached)
- **3**: Massive impact - Core value proposition, game-changing
- **2**: High impact - Significant improvement to user experience
- **1**: Medium impact - Noticeable improvement
- **0.5**: Low impact - Minor improvement or edge case

#### Confidence (Confidence in Reach and Impact estimates)
- **100%**: High confidence - Strong data/evidence
- **80%**: Medium confidence - Some data/evidence
- **50%**: Low confidence - Limited data/assumptions

#### Effort (Development time in person-months)
- **0.5**: Very small (1-2 weeks)
- **1**: Small (1 month)
- **2**: Medium (2 months)
- **4**: Large (4 months)
- **8**: Very large (8+ months)

### RICE Score Calculation
**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**
