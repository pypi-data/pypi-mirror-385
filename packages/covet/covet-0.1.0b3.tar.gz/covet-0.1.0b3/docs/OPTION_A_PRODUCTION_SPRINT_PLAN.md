## üö® RISK MANAGEMENT

### High Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Test suite unfixable | Low | High | Already have fix strategy |
| Performance claims false | Medium | High | Week 5 validation |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Week 6 audit |
| Infrastructure delays | Medium | High | Start Week 3 early |
| Team availability | Low | Medium | Buffer week included |

### Contingency Plans

**If behind schedule**:
1. Reduce scope (remove nice-to-haves)
2. Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks
3. Add additional resources
4. Launch as "Beta" instead

**If critical blocker found**:
1. Stop-the-line approach
2. All teams focus on blocker
3. Daily standup until resolved
4. Executive escalation if needed
