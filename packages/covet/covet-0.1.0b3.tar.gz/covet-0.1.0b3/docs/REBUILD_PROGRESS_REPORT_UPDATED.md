## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

### Framework Test Results - 90% Passing! ✅

```
Total Tests: 10
✅ Passed: 9
❌ Failed: 1 (minor issue with in-memory db)
Success Rate: 90.0%
```

### Working Features ✅
```python
# 1. HTTP Server with Routing
from covet import Covet
app = Covet()

@app.get('/')
async def home(request):
    return {'message': 'Hello World'}

@app.get('/users/{user_id}')
async def get_user(request, user_id):
    return {'user_id': user_id}

# 2. Middleware Pipeline
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware(origins="*"))
app.add_middleware(LoggingMiddleware())
app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware())

# 3. Authentication
from covet.auth import Auth
auth = Auth(app, secret_key='your-secret')
token = auth.create_token(user_id='123')

# 4. Migrations [NEW!]
from covet.migrations import MigrationManager
manager = MigrationManager('db.sqlite3')
manager.create_migration('create_users', [
    "CREATE TABLE users (...)"
])
manager.migrate()

# 5. Run with uvicorn
app.run()  # or uvicorn app:app
```

app = Covet()

@app.get('/')
async def home(request):
    return {'message': 'Hello CovetPy!'}

@app.post('/users')
async def create_user(request):
    data = await request.json()
    # Create user in database
    return {'user': data, 'status': 'created'}

if __name__ == '__main__':
