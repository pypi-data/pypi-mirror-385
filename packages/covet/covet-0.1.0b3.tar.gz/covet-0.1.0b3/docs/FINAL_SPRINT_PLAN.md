## Success Definition

**CovetPy 1.0 is successful when:**
1. A real-world application can be built and deployed using only CovetPy
2. The framework passes a comprehensive security audit
3. Performance meets or exceeds Flask/FastAPI for common use cases
4. Developer experience is smooth and well-documented
5. Community adoption begins (first external contributors)

This sprint plan is realistic, achievable, and focused on delivering actual value rather than impressive-sounding features that don't work.
