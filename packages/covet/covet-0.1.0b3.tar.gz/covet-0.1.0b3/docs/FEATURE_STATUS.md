## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **MySQL Adapter**: Basic functionality works, but advanced features need more testing
2. **Rate Limiting**: Only in-memory, no distributed rate limiting yet
3. **Backup System**: Completely missing, planned for Sprint 3
4. **GraphQL Parser**: Using external library (graphql-core) instead of custom parser
5. **Many-to-Many ORM**: Partial implementation, some edge cases not handled
6. **Monitoring**: Basic metrics only, no Prometheus/APM integration

```bash
# Run feature tests
pytest tests/unit/test_<feature>.py -v

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Check specific implementation
python -c "from covet.<module> import <feature>"
```
