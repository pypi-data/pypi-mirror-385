   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive setup guide provided
   - **Future**: Automated setup scripts

3. **Synchronous Replication**: Async replication only (PostgreSQL supports sync)
   - **Mitigation**: Low lag thresholds
   - **Future**: Sync replication option

### Planned Enhancements (Post-V1)

1. **Distributed Consensus**: Consul/etcd integration for split-brain prevention
2. **Automatic Lag Recovery**: Intelligent lag management strategies
3. **Read Preference Hints**: SQL comment-based routing hints
4. **Query Cost Estimation**: Route expensive queries differently
5. **Connection Warming**: Pre-establish connections for faster failover

## Risk Assessment

### Production Risks: ⚠️ LOW

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Replication lag | Medium | Medium | Real-time monitoring + alerts |

## Appendix B: Quick Start Example

```python
from covet.database.replication import (
    ReplicaManager, ReplicaConfig, ReadWriteSplitter,
    DatabaseType, ConsistencyLevel
)

# Setup
manager = ReplicaManager(
    primary=ReplicaConfig(
        host="primary.db.example.com",
        db_type=DatabaseType.POSTGRESQL
    ),
    replicas=[
        ReplicaConfig(host="replica1.db.example.com"),
        ReplicaConfig(host="replica2.db.example.com"),
    ]
)

await manager.start()

splitter = ReadWriteSplitter(
    manager,
    default_consistency=ConsistencyLevel.READ_AFTER_WRITE
)

# Usage
session = splitter.create_session()

# Write (→ primary)
async with splitter.route("INSERT INTO users ...", session=session) as conn:
    await conn.execute("INSERT INTO users ...")

# Read (→ replica, with read-after-write consistency)
async with splitter.route("SELECT * FROM users", session=session) as conn:
    users = await conn.fetch_all("SELECT * FROM users")
