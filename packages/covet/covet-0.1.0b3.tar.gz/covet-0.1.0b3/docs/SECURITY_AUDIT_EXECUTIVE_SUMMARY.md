## REMEDIATION PATH TO PRODUCTION

### Phase 1: IMMEDIATE (Week 1) - 17 hours
**Goal:** Eliminate critical vulnerabilities

- Replace PyCrypto library
- Fix SQL injection in cache
- Remove hardcoded credentials
- Fix insecure temp files

**Result:** Security score → 78/100 (Moderate Risk)

### Phase 2: HIGH PRIORITY (Week 2) - 24 hours
**Goal:** Harden security posture

- Upgrade weak cryptography
- Eliminate pickle deserialization
- Secure build scripts
- Add security test suite

**Result:** Security score → 88/100 (Low Risk)

### Phase 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY (Weeks 3-4) - 30 hours
**Goal:** Production hardening

- Fix remaining SQL issues
- Implement rate limiting
- Enforce security headers
- Update dependencies

**Result:** Security score → 95/100 (Production Ready)
