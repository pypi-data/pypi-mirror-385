Gitlab module for Clearskies

This template scaffolds a dynamic Clearskies module for any kind of logic, integration, or API. You can use it to build modules for data processing, service integration, automation, or any custom business logic.

Your module can implement any logic you need: fetch data, process input, interact with external services, or perform custom actions. The endpoints and payloads are up to you.
