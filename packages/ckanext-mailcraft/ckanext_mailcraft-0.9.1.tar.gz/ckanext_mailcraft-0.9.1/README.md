# ckanext-mailcraft

The `ckanext-mailcraft` adds powerful email management features to CKAN, making it easier to style, track, and control outgoing messages.

**Features**
- Flexible Mailer – a custom mailer that can be easily extended to fit your needs
- Pre-styled Templates – an example email template you can customize to match your branding
- Email Logging – configurable option to save outgoing emails and view them in the dashboard
- Email Control – configurable option to temporarily stop outgoing messages when needed
- Redirection – configurable option to reroute all outgoing emails to one or more specified addresses

To enable the extension, add `mailcraft` to the `ckan.plugins` setting in your CKAN.
If you want to enable the dashboard you should also add `tables mailcraft_dashboard` to the `ckan.plugins` setting.

## Usage
To use a mailer, you just have to import it and initialize the mailer.

```python
from ckanext.mailcraft.utils import get_mailer

mailer = get_mailer()

mailer.mail_recipients(
    subject="Hello world",
    recipients=["test@gmail.com"],
    body="Hello world",
    body_html=tk.render(
        "mailcraft/emails/test.html",
        extra_vars={"site_url": mailer.site_url, "site_title": mailer.site_title},
    ),
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using environment variables to configure the SMTP server, you must create the mailer instance within a method or function scope; otherwise, the mailer will take the config options from the CKAN config file.

## Dashboard
****
To access the dashboard, first ensure that the `tables mailcraft_dashboard` plugins are enabled in your CKAN configuration. Then you'll have a button at the top right of the CKAN interface that will take you to the Mailcraft dashboard.

The `tables` plugin is required to render the dashboard table.

The dashboard provides an overview of all outgoing emails, including their status (sent, failed, etc.), recipients, and timestamps. You can filter and search through the emails to find specific ones.

The `ckanext.mailcraft.save_emails` config option must be set to `true` to save outgoing emails and view them in the dashboard. You can also press the `View` button to see the full content of each email.
