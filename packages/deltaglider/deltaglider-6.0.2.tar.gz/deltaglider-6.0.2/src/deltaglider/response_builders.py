"""Type-safe response builders using TypedDicts for internal type safety.

This module provides builder functions that construct boto3-compatible responses
with full compile-time type validation using TypedDicts. At runtime, TypedDicts
are plain dicts, so there's no conversion overhead.

Benefits:
- Field name typos caught by mypy (e.g., "HTTPStatusCode" â†’ "HttpStatusCode")
- Wrong types caught by mypy (e.g., string instead of int)
- Missing required fields caught by mypy
- Extra unknown fields caught by mypy
