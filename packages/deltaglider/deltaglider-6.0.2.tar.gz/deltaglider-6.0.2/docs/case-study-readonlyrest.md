# Case Study: How ReadOnlyREST Reduced Storage Costs by 99.9% with DeltaGlider

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge**: ReadOnlyREST, a security plugin for Elasticsearch, was facing exponential storage costs managing 145 release versions across multiple product lines, consuming nearly 4TB of S3 storage.

**The Solution**: DeltaGlider, an intelligent delta compression system that reduced storage from 4,060GB to just 4.9GB.

**The Impact**:
- 💰 **$1,119 annual savings** on storage costs
- 📉 **99.9% reduction** in storage usage
- ⚡ **Zero changes** to existing workflows
- ✅ **Full data integrity** maintained

## The Storage Crisis

### The Numbers That Kept Us Up at Night

ReadOnlyREST maintains a comprehensive release archive:
- **145 version folders** (v1.50.0 through v1.66.1)
- **201,840 total files** to manage
- **3.96 TB** of S3 storage consumed
- **$1,120/year** in storage costs alone

Each version folder contained:
- 513 plugin ZIP files (one for each Elasticsearch version)
- 879 checksum files (SHA1 and SHA512)
- 3 product lines (Enterprise, Pro, Free)

### The Hidden Problem

What made this particularly painful wasn't just the size—it was the **redundancy**. Each 82.5MB plugin ZIP was 99.7% identical to others in the same version, differing only in minor Elasticsearch compatibility adjustments. We were essentially storing the same data hundreds of times.

> "We were paying to store 4TB of data that was fundamentally just variations of the same ~250MB of unique content. It felt like photocopying War and Peace 500 times because each copy had a different page number."

## Enter DeltaGlider

### The Lightbulb Moment

The breakthrough came when we realized we didn't need to store complete files—just the *differences* between them. DeltaGlider applies this principle automatically:

1. **First file becomes the reference** (stored in full)
2. **Similar files store only deltas** (typically 0.3% of original size)
3. **Different files uploaded directly** (no delta overhead)

### Implementation: Surprisingly Simple

```bash
# Before DeltaGlider (standard S3 upload)
aws s3 cp readonlyrest-1.66.1_es8.0.0.zip s3://releases/
# Size on S3: 82.5MB

# With DeltaGlider
deltaglider cp readonlyrest-1.66.1_es8.0.0.zip s3://releases/
# Size on S3: 65KB (99.92% smaller!)
```

The beauty? **Zero changes to our build pipeline**. DeltaGlider works as a drop-in replacement for S3 uploads.

## The Results: Beyond Our Expectations

### Storage Transformation

```
BEFORE DELTAGLIDER          AFTER DELTAGLIDER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4,060 GB (3.96 TB)    →    4.9 GB
$93.38/month          →    $0.11/month
201,840 files         →    201,840 files (same!)
```

### Real Performance Metrics

From our actual production deployment:

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Compression Ratio** | 99.9% | Near-perfect deduplication |
| **Delta Size** | ~65KB per 82.5MB file | 1/1,269th of original |
| **Upload Speed** | 3-4 files/second | Faster than raw S3 uploads |
| **Download Speed** | Transparent reconstruction | No user impact |
| **Storage Savings** | 4,055 GB | Enough for 850,000 more files |

### Version-to-Version Comparison

Testing between similar versions showed incredible efficiency:

```
readonlyrest-1.66.1_es7.17.0.zip  (82.5MB) → reference.bin (82.5MB)
readonlyrest-1.66.1_es7.17.1.zip  (82.5MB) → 64KB delta (0.08% size)
readonlyrest-1.66.1_es7.17.2.zip  (82.5MB) → 65KB delta (0.08% size)
...
readonlyrest-1.66.1_es8.15.0.zip  (82.5MB) → 71KB delta (0.09% size)
```

## Technical Deep Dive

### How DeltaGlider Achieves 99.9% Compression

DeltaGlider uses binary diff algorithms (xdelta3) to identify and store only the bytes that change between files:

```python
# Simplified concept
reference = "readonlyrest-1.66.1_es7.17.0.zip"  # 82.5MB
new_file  = "readonlyrest-1.66.1_es7.17.1.zip"  # 82.5MB

delta = binary_diff(reference, new_file)         # 65KB
# Delta contains only:
# - Elasticsearch version string changes
# - Compatibility metadata updates
# - Build timestamp differences
```

### Intelligent File Type Detection

Not every file benefits from delta compression. DeltaGlider automatically:

- **Applies delta compression to**: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.dmg`, `.jar`, `.war`
- **Uploads directly**: `.txt`, `.sha1`, `.sha512`, `.json`, `.md`

This intelligence meant our 127,455 checksum files were uploaded directly, avoiding unnecessary processing overhead.

## For Decision Makers

### Why This Matters

Storage costs scale linearly with data growth. Without DeltaGlider:
- Next 145 versions: Additional $1,120/year
- 5-year projection: $11,200 in storage alone
- Opportunity cost: Resources that could fund innovation

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Vendor lock-in | Open-source, standards-based | ✅ Mitigated |
| Data corruption | SHA256 verification built-in | ✅ Mitigated |
| Performance impact | Faster than original | ✅ No risk |
| Complexity | Drop-in replacement | ✅ No risk |

### Strategic Advantages

1. **Cost Predictability**: Storage costs become negligible
2. **Scalability**: Can handle 100x more versions in same space
3. **Competitive Edge**: More resources for product development
4. **Green IT**: Reduced carbon footprint from storage
