# Optional docker cp mappings keyed by image reference.
#
# Use the "default" section to define entries that apply to all images.
# Additional sections can be keyed by the full image reference
# (e.g. "ozkrelo/mobipick_labs:noetic") or just the repository name.
#
# Each mapping requires a host path and a container path. Host paths may
# include "~" or environment variables, which will be expanded.
#
# Files listed in "host_to_container" are copied automatically into the
# container shortly after it starts. Entries under "container_to_host"
# are copied when the "Execute Docker cp" button is pressed.
#
# Example:
# ozkrelo/mobipick_labs:noetic:
#   host_to_container:
#     - host: ~/Downloads/nav3.rviz
#       container: /root/catkin_ws/src/mobipick_labs/tables_demo_bringup/config/nav3.rviz
#   container_to_host:
#     - host: ~/Downloads/nav4.rviz
#       container: /root/catkin_ws/src/mobipick_labs/tables_demo_bringup/config/nav4.rviz
#
# By default no automatic copies are performed from container to host.
default:
  host_to_container: # automatically copied over after container starts
    - host: ~/Downloads/pick_n_place.rviz
      container: /root/catkin_ws/src/mobipick_labs/tables_demo_bringup/config/pick_n_place.rviz
  container_to_host: # need button press
    - container: /root/catkin_ws/src/mobipick_labs/tables_demo_bringup/config/pick_n_place.rviz
      host: ~/Downloads/pick_n_place.rviz
