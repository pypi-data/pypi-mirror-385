    A DataSchema describes the layout of a file. Like HDF5, the schemas are organized

    example, a DatasetSchema holds ColumnSchemas, and is responsible for verifying that
    all of its columns have the same length.

    A schema most be capable of transforming into a writer. As such, some schemas such
    as the ColumnSchema must hold reference to the data that wthey will write, as well
    as an index into the data of the elements that should be included.

    Schemas also must allocate their respective structures, i.e. by creating groups or
