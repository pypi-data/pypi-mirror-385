"""
Plot 6·J0*(c) – 3 for the limiting case a → 0⁻ in
‘A Complete Semi-Analytical Solution to a Concave Functional Optimization Problem’.

The cubic that fixes the global multiplier d₀*(c) is taken from the
corrected derivation (Eq. 3.5), which in the a→0⁻ limit simplifies to:
8(1-c)·d·(d+1)² = 0 .
For every c∈[−½,1), this equation has a unique non-negative root d=0.

NOTE: The formula for J₀*(d) must also be re-derived. The function used
here is from the old analysis and is incorrect. This script is for demonstration
of the new d₀*(c) only.
