The RAG Evaluation Framework supports three classes of metrics:

- **Generation Metrics** — measure semantic/factual quality of answers.
- **Ranking Metrics** — measure ranking quality of rerankers.
- **Retrieval Metrics** — measure the quality and sufficiency of the retrieved context.

Below you will find detailed pages for each metric.
