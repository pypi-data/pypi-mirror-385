        Parameters
        ----------
        image
            The image before simulating (e.g. the lens and source galaxies before optics blurring and Imaging read-out).
        pixel_scales
            The scale of each pixel in arc seconds
        exposure_time_map
            An arrays representing the effective exposure time of each pixel.
        psf: PSF
            An arrays describing the PSF the simulated image is blurred with.
        add_poisson_noise_to_data: Bool
            If `True` poisson noise_maps is simulated and added to the image, based on the total counts in each image
            pixel
        noise_seed: int
            A seed for random noise_maps generation

        """
        Simulate an `Imaging` dataset from an input deflection angle map and list of galaxies.

        The input deflection angle map ray-traces the image-plane coordinates from the image-plane to source-plane,
        via the lens equation.

        This traced grid is then used to evaluate the light of the list of galaxies, which therefore simulate the
        image of the strong lens.

        This function is used in situations where one has access to a deflection angle map which does not suit being
        ray-traced using a `Tracer` object (e.g. deflection angles from a cosmological simulation of a galaxy).

        The steps of the `SimulatorImaging` simulation process (e.g. PSF convolution, noise addition) are
        described in the `SimulatorImaging` `__init__` method docstring.

        Parameters
        ----------
        galaxies
            The galaxies used to create the tracer, which describes the ray-tracing and strong lens configuration
            used to simulate the imaging dataset.
        grid
            The image-plane 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates grid which the image of the strong lens is generated on.
