Demagnified Solutions
=====================

Overview
--------

When fitting a lens model using a pixelized source reconstruction, it is common for unphysical and inaccurate lens
models to be estimated.

This is due to demagnified source reconstructions, where the source is reconstructed as the lensed source galaxy
(without any lensing):

What has happened above is that the mass model has gone to an extremely low mass solution, such that essentially no
ray-tracing occurs. The best source reconstruction to fit the data is therefore one where the source is reconstructed
to look exactly like the observed lensed source.

In fact, there are two variants of these unwanted systematic solutions, with the second variant corresponding to mass
models with **too much mass**, such that the ray-tracing inverts in on itself.

The following schematic is from the paper Maresca et al 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04665) and illustrates
this beautifully:

The source reconstructions and model-fits of these solutions are also illustrated by Maresca et al 2021:

The demagnified solutions are not as high likelihood as the physical and accurate mass model shown in the central
row of the figure above. However, the demagnified solutions **occupy a much greater volume of non-linear parameter space**.

This means that when we fit a lens model, it is highly probable that all solutions correspond to demagnified solutions,
such that the non-linear search converges on these solutions and never samples the accurate physical mass model.

Solution
--------

To prevent a non-linear search from inferring these unwanted solutions **PyAutoLens** penalizes the likelihood
via a position thresholding term. 

First, we specify the locations of the lensed source's multiple images, which the example code below does:

.. code-block:: python

    positions = al.Grid2DIrregular(
        grid=[(0.4, 1.6), (1.58, -0.35), (-0.43, -1.59), (-1.45, 0.2)]
    )

Here is where the multiple images appear for an example strong lens, where multiple images are drawn on with black
stars:

  :alt: Alternative text

The ``autolens_workspace`` also includes a Graphical User Interface for drawing lensed source positions via 
mouse click (https://github.com/Jammy2211/autolens_workspace/blob/release/scripts/imaging/preprocess/gui/positions.py).

Next, we create ``PositionsLH`` object, which has an input ``threshold``.

This requires that a mass model traces the multiple image ``positions`` specified above within the ``threshold`` 
value (e.g. 0.5") of one another in the source-plane. If this criteria is not met, a large penalty term is
applied to likelihood that massively reduces the overall likelihood. This penalty is larger if the ``positions``
trace further from one another.

This ensures the unphysical solutions that produce demagnified solutions have a much lower likelihood that the 
physical solutions we desire. Furthermore, the penalty term reduces as the image-plane multiple image ``positions``
trace closer in the source-plane, ensuring the non-linear search (e.g. Dynesty) converges towards an accurate mass
model. It does this very fast, as ray-tracing just a few multiple image positions is computationally cheap.

If the ``positions`` do trace within the ``threshold`` no penalty is applied.

The penalty term is created and passed to an ``Analysis`` object as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    positions_likelihood = al.PositionsLH(positions=positions, threshold=0.3)

    analysis = al.AnalysisImaging(
        dataset=dataset, positions_likelihood_list=[positions_likelihood]
    )

The threshold of 0.5" is large. For an accurate lens model we would anticipate the positions trace within < 0.01" of
one another. However, we only want the threshold to aid the non-linear with the choice of mass model in the initial fit
and remove demagnified solutions.

Auto Position Updates
---------------------

There are a number of downsides to having to input the multiple images positions manually:

 - For large lens samples this could take a lot of time.

 - For complex sources, it can be unclear which brightness peaks in the image-plane lensed source correspond to the same emission in the source-plane.

**PyAutoLens** allows the ``positions`` and ``threshold`` to be computed if a model for the lens mass is available.

This is the case for lens modeling pipelines which use **PyAutoLens**'s search chaining functionality, because the
early fits in these pipelines fit a parametric source model which does not suffer these demagnified solutions.

If we have a ``result`` from a previous search, which contains a mass model for the lens galaxy and a light model
for the source (the centre of which is used to compute the multiple image ``positions``) we can compute a new
set of multiple image positions from this result:

.. code-block:: python

    result.image_plane_multiple_image_positions

We can also compute a ``threshold`` from the result, where this threshold value corresponds to the maximum separation
of the ``result.image_plane_multiple_image_positions`` computed above but ray traced to the source-plane using
the ``result``'s maximum likelihood mass model.

.. code-block:: python

    result.positions_threshold_from(factor=2.0, minimum_threshold=0.3)

The ``factor`` input is a value that the computed ``threshold`` is multiplied by. For example, if a ``threshold`` of
0.1" is computed, the returned value above for ``factor=2.0`` will be 0.2".

The ``minimum_threshold`` is the lowest number the function return will reutnr. Above, if a ``threshold`` of 0.1"
is computed, the function will return 0.3" because ``minimum_threshold==0.3``.

These inputs are useful when using function to set the ``threshold`` in a new fit of a search chaining pipeline, as
it allows us to make sure we do set too small a threshold that we remove genuinely physically mass models.

For writing search chaining pipelines, a convenience method is available in the ``result`` which returns directly a
``PositionsLH`` object:

.. code-block:: python

        result_1.positions_likelihood_from(
            factor=3.0, minimum_threshold=0.2
        )

This is often used to set up new ``Analysis`` objects with a positions penalty concisely:

.. code-block:: python

    analysis = al.AnalysisImaging(
        dataset=dataset,
        positions_likelihood=result_1.positions_likelihood_from(
            factor=3.0, minimum_threshold=0.2
        ),
    )

Multiple Source Plane Systems
-----------------------------

A double source plane system is a lens system where there are multiple source-planes at different redshifts, meaning that
incuding the image-plane there are at least 3 planes.

The ``PositionsLH`` class can have a `plane_redshift` input, which specifies the redshift of the source-plane
the positions are ray-traced to.

Multiple ``PositionsLH`` objects can be passed to the ``Analysis`` object, which then applies the penalty term to
both source-planes independently such that a double source-plane system can be fitted with the penalty based likelihood
functionality.

.. code-block:: python

    positions_likelihood_source_plane_0 = al.PositionsLH(positions=positions, threshold=0.3, plane_redshift=1.0)
    positions_likelihood_source_plane_1 = al.PositionsLH(positions=positions, threshold=0.3, plane_redshift=2.0)

    analysis = al.AnalysisImaging(
        dataset=dataset, positions_likelihood_list=
            [
                positions_likelihood_source_plane_0,
                positions_likelihood_source_plane_1
            ]
    )

To set up an ``Analysis`` object with multiple ``PositionsLH`` objects from a result, each positions likelihood is
computed from the result for each ``plane_redshift``:

.. code-block::

    analysis = al.AnalysisImaging(
        dataset=dataset,
        positions_likelihood_list=[
            source_lp_result.positions_likelihood_from(
                factor=3.0, minimum_threshold=0.2, plane_redshift=source_lp_result.instance.galaxies.source_1.redshift,
            ),
            source_lp_result.positions_likelihood_from(
                factor=3.0, minimum_threshold=0.2, plane_redshift=source_lp_result.instance.galaxies.source_2.redshift,
            )
        ],
    )
