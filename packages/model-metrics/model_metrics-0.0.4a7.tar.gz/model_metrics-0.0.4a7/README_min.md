Welcome to Model Metrics! Model Metrics is a versatile Python library designed to streamline the evaluation and interpretation of machine learning models. It provides a robust framework for generating predictions, computing model metrics, analyzing feature importance, and visualizing results. Whether you're working with SHAP values, model coefficients, confusion matrices, ROC curves, precision-recall plots, and other key performance indicators.
