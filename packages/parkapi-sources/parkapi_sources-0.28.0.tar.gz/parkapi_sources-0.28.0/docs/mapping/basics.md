# Mapping basics

Some rules apply to all converters, they are collected in this document.

* Datasets are split up into `StaticInput` and `RealtimeInput`. But inputs have a `uid` which used as the connection
  between these two objects: same `uid` means same parking site / parking spot / ...
* `uid`s should be unique in scope of the data source. Therefore, `uid`s are transformed into `original_uid` if used
  by the ParkAPI project.
* If a data source just provides a polygon or a linestring, lat / lon are generated by calculating the centroid
