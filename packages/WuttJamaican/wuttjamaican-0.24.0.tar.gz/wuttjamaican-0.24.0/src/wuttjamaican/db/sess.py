WuttJamaican -  database sessions

.. class:: Session

   SQLAlchemy session class used for all (normal) :term:`app database`
   connections.

   See the upstream :class:`sqlalchemy:sqlalchemy.orm.Session` docs
   for more info.
"""

Session = orm.sessionmaker()  # pylint: disable=invalid-name


class short_session:  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
    """
    Context manager for a short-lived database session.

    A canonical use case for this is when the config object needs to
    grab a single setting value from the DB, but it does not have an
    active DB session to do it.  This context manager is used to
    produce the session, and close it when finished.  For example::

       with short_session(config) as s:
          result = s.query("select something from somewhere").scalar()

    How it goes about producing the session instance will depend on
    which of the following 3 params are given (explained below):

    * ``config``
    * ``factory``
    * ``session``

    Note that it is also okay if you provide *none* of the above
    params, in which case the main :class:`Session` class will be used
    as the factory.

    :param config: Optional app config object.  If a new session must
       be created, the config will be consulted to determine the
       factory which is used to create the new session.

    :param factory: Optional factory to use when making a new session.
       If specified, this will override the ``config`` mechanism.

    :param session: Optional SQLAlchemy session instance.  If a valid
       session is provided here, it will be used instead of creating a
       new/temporary session.

    :param commit: Whether the temporary session should be committed
       before it is closed.  This flag has no effect if a valid
       ``session`` instance is provided, since no temporary session
       will be created.
