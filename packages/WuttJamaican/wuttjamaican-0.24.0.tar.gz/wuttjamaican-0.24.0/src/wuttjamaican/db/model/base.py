Base Models

   This is the base class for all :term:`data models <data model>` in

    def make_proxy(cls, main_class, extension, name, proxy_name=None):
        """
        Convenience method to declare an "association proxy" for the
        main class, per the params.

        For more info see
        :doc:`sqlalchemy:orm/extensions/associationproxy`.

        :param main_class: Reference to the "parent" model class, upon
           which the proxy will be defined.

        :param extension: Attribute name on the main class, which
           references the extension record.

        :param name: Attribute name on the extension class, which
           provides the proxied value.

        :param proxy_name: Optional attribute name on the main class,
           which will reference the proxy.  If not specified, ``name``
           will be used.

        As a simple example consider this model, which extends the
        :class:`~wuttjamaican.db.model.auth.User` class.  In
        particular note the last line which is what we're documenting
        here::

           import sqlalchemy as sa
           from sqlalchemy import orm
           from wuttjamaican.db import model

           class PoserUser(model.Base):
               \""" Poser extension for User \"""
               __tablename__ = 'poser_user'

               uuid = model.uuid_column(sa.ForeignKey('user.uuid'), default=None)
               user = orm.relationship(
                   model.User,
                   doc="Reference to the main User record.",
                   backref=orm.backref(
                       '_poser',
                       uselist=False,
                       cascade='all, delete-orphan',
                       doc="Reference to the Poser extension record."))

               favorite_color = sa.Column(sa.String(length=100), nullable=False, doc=\"""
               User's favorite color.
               \""")

           def __str__(self):
               return str(self.user)

           # nb. this is the method call
           PoserUser.make_proxy(model.User, '_poser', 'favorite_color')

        That code defines a ``PoserUser`` model but also defines a
        ``favorite_color`` attribute on the main ``User`` class, such
        that it can be used normally::

            user = model.User(username='barney', favorite_color='green')
            session.add(user)

            user = session.query(model.User).filter_by(username='bambam').one()
            print(user.favorite_color)
