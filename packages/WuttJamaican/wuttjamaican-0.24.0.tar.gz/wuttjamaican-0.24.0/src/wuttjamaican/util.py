    valid Python object, i.e. not necessarily a class instance.  The name may
    refer to a class, function, variable etc.  Once the module is imported, the
    ``getattr()`` function is used to obtain a reference to the named object;

       indicator, or can be ``None`` for no progress.

    :param message: Message to display along with the progress
       indicator.  If no message is specified, whether a default is
       shown will be up to the progress indicator.

    The ``func`` param should be a callable which accepts 2 positional
    args ``(obj, i)`` - meaning for which is as follows:

    :param obj: This will be an item within the sequence.

    :param i: This will be the *one-based* sequence number for the

    the path, possibly extracting the file(s) from a zipped package,
    and returning the final path on disk.

    It only does this if it detects it is needed, based on the given
    ``path`` argument.  If that is already an absolute path then it
    will be returned as-is.
