    This callback is responsible for creating the :term:`config

    that.)  It then attaches it to the context as

    """
    Eagerly import all modules which are registered as having
    :term:`subcommands <subcommand>` belonging to the given group
    (i.e. top-level :term:`command`).

    This is used to locate subcommands which may be defined by
    multiple different packages.  It is mostly needed for the main
    ``wutta`` command, since e.g. various extension packages may
    define additional subcommands for it.

    Most custom apps will define their own top-level command and some
    subcommands, but will have no need to "discover" additional
    subcommands defined elsewhere.  Hence you normally would not need
    to call this function.

    However if you wish to define a ``wutta`` subcommand(s), you
    *would* need to register the entry point for your module(s)
    containing the subcommand(s) like so (in ``pyproject.toml``):

    .. code-block:: ini

       [project.entry-points."wutta.typer_imports"]
       poser = "poser.commands"

    Note that the ``wutta.typer_imports`` above indicates you are
    registering a module which defines ``wutta`` subcommands.  The
    ``poser`` name is arbitrary but should match your package name.

    This function is used to create the top-level ``wutta`` command,
    :data:`wutta_typer`.  You can use it to create additional
    top-level commands for your app if needed.  (And don't forget to
    register; see :doc:`/narr/cli/custom`.)
