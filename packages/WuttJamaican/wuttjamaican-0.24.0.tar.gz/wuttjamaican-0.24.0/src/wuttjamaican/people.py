        to determine if/how a person can be found.  It should return
        the "first, most obvious" person in the event that the object
        is associated with multiple people.

        This is a rather fundamental method, in that it is called by
        several other methods, both within this handler as well as
        others.  There is also a shortcut to it, accessible via
