    Base class and default implementation for the :term:`auth

    This is responsible for "authentication and authorization" - for
    instance:

    * check which permissions a user/role has
    * create/modify users, roles
    * grant/revoke role permissions

        Authenticate the given user credentials, and if successful,
        return the :class:`~wuttjamaican.db.model.auth.User`.

        Default logic will (try to) locate a user with matching
        username, then confirm the supplied password is also a match.

        Custom handlers can authenticate against anything else, using
        the given credentials.  But they still must return a "native"
        ``User`` object for the app to consider the authentication
        successful.  The handler may auto-create the user if needed.

        Generally speaking the credentials will have come directly
        from a user login attempt in the web app etc.  Again the
        default logic assumes a "username" but in practice it may be
        an email address etc. - whatever the user entered.

        is *not* yet taken.

        It returns the first "available" (hence unique) username which
        is found.  Note that it is considered unique and therefore
        available *at the time*; however this method does not
        "reserve" the username in any way.  It is assumed that you
