Email
=====

There is some built-in support for sending emails from your app.  The
primary intended use case is for "internal" emails, e.g. sending daily
reports to the finance team etc.  Each "type" of email can be sent to
different recipients.

You also may want to configure logging such that you receive email
when errors are logged.
