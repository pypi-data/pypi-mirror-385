Prerequisites
=============

Wuttjamaican requires Python, and optionally a database of some sort.


Python
------

Currently at least Python 3.8 is required.

Also note, Python 3.11 is the newest version being tested so far.

Database
--------

If you need an :term:`app database` then you will also need the
backend and/or libraries to support that.

The recommendation is to use PostgreSQL but this is further documented
elsewhere; see :ref:`create-appdb`.
