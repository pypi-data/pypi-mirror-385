**MoleCool** is a Python library for **numerical modeling of light–matter interactions**,  
with a focus on **laser cooling of molecules** — from simple few-level systems and diatomics  
to polyatomics and even radioactive species.

## ✨ Overview

**MoleCool** enables you to **simulate, analyze, and visualize** the dynamics of laser–molecule interactions  
for designing and optimizing experimental setups in state-of-the-art cooling and trapping experiments.

### Key Features

- **Flexible dynamics solvers** — rate equations and Optical Bloch equations (OBEs),  
  including effects of external magnetic fields.  
  MoleCool reads predefined molecular constants (dipole matrix elements, hyperfine frequencies,  
  g-factors, etc.) from JSON files.

- **Interactive level-scheme handling** — intuitive tools for exploring and visualizing  
  electronic, vibrational, and rotational structures.

- **Laser cooling force profiles** — fast evaluation across high-dimensional parameter spaces  
  for optimization of cooling configurations.

- **Monte Carlo trajectory simulations** — track many particles through laser fields  
  using pre-evaluated force profiles for statistical reliability.

- **Spectra analysis module** — compute, fit, and interpret molecular spectra via  
  effective Hamiltonians; extract constants for use in dynamics simulations.

### Target Audience

MoleCool is intended for **researchers and physicists** working in  
**atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics**, particularly in:

- Modeling laser–molecule interactions  
- Optimizing cooling and trapping experiments  
- Interpreting or predicting spectroscopic measurements

## 🚀 Quickstart Example

Below is a minimal working example demonstrating MoleCool’s basic workflow:

```python
from MoleCool import System

# Initialize a molecular system (e.g. 138BaF)
system = System(load_constants='138BaF')

# Build level scheme and remove loss channels
system.levels.add_all_levels(v_max=0)
system.levels.X.del_lossstate()

# Define a multi-sideband laser configuration
system.lasers.add_sidebands(
    lamb        = 859.83e-9,
    P           = 20e-3,
    offset_freq = 19e6,
    mod_freq    = 39.33e6,
    sidebands   = [-2, -1, 1, 2],
    ratios      = [0.8, 1, 1, 0.8],
)

# Turn on a magnetic field
system.Bfield.turnon(strength=5e-4, direction=[1, 1, 1])

# Run dynamics simulations
system.calc_OBEs(t_int=8e-6, dt=1e-9, magn_remixing=True)
system.calc_rateeqs(t_int=8e-6, magn_remixing=True, position_dep=True)

# Visualize populations
system.plot_N()
```

## ⚡ Performance and Parallelization

- Dynamics equations are solved using [`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)
  and compiled with **Numba**’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler for near-C speed.  
- Independent simulations are automatically parallelized across multiple cores  
  using Python’s `multiprocessing` module — ideal for large parameter sweeps  
  and Monte Carlo trajectory studies.
