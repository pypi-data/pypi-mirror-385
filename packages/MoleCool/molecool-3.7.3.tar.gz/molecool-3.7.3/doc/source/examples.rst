Examples
========

Our collection of examples demonstrates the full range of capabilities in
``MoleCool``, from simple educational systems to complex, real-world scenarios
involving diatomics, polyatomics, and even radioactive species.
Each example is fully executable and provides hands-on insight into how
to use the key functionalities of the library.

.. note::
   
   The core examples are further elaborated on in our arxiv paper introducing
   the package: |arxiv_badge|

The examples are organized into galleries, making it easy to navigate and explore:
each gallery not only shows the code in action but also provides links
to the corresponding API documentation for every class and function.
This allows you to inspect, understand, and adapt the code to your own needs.  

Whether you are learning the basics or tackling sophisticated simulations,
these examples serve as a practical guide to mastering MoleCool.
