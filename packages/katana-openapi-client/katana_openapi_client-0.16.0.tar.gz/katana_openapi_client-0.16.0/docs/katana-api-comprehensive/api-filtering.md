# Filtering

Below are some of the filters currently allowed by default to all endpoints within the
provided collections (besides `/inventory` and `/batch_stocks`).

| Key               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ids`             | An array of object IDs.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `limit`           | See Pagination.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `page`            | See Pagination.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `created_at_min`  | Return results created **after** this date. Format example: `2021-04-14T10:39:40.054Z`.                                                                                                               |
| `created_at_max`  | Return results created **before** this date. Format example: `2021-04-14T10:39:40.054Z`.                                                                                                              |
| `updated_at_min`  | Return results updated **after** this date. Format example: `2021-04-14T10:39:40.054Z`.                                                                                                               |
| `updated_at_max`  | Return results updated **before** this date. Format example: `2021-04-14T10:39:40.054Z`.                                                                                                              |
| `include_deleted` | Set to `false` by default. If set to `true`, soft-deleted records are included in the result set. Some resources don't support access to deleted data â€” see the corresponding endpoint documentation. |
| `extend`          | An array of linked objects. When specified, the linked object will be included in the response payload.                                                                                               |
|                   | **Note:** Date filters use ISO 8601 format and come in pairs that accept both `_min` and `_max` parameters.                                                                                           |

## Example

## ðŸš§

If an invalid parameter is added to the filter, it won't be applied to the results.
Always double-check and make sure you've used the syntax correctly! If no results match
a filter, an empty array will be returned.
