# HTTP status codes

Katana API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API
requests. Katana will return an error with the corresponding status code if a request
fails. In general, there are three status code ranges one can expect:

## ðŸš§

4xx and 5xx responses may be returned for any request and clients should be ready to
cater to them. All errors return with this same structure: JSON{ "error": {
"statusCode": \<STATUS_CODE> "name": \<ERROR_NAME>, "code": \<ERROR_CODE>, "details":
\<DETAILS - NOT ALWAYS PRESENT> } {

## Example

HTTPHTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity Content-Type: application/json "statusCode": 422,
"name": "UnprocessableEntityError", "message": "The request body is invalid. See error
object `details` property for more info.", "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "details": \[
"path": ".city", "code": "maxLength", "message": "should NOT be longer than 10
characters", "info": { "limit": 10 \] HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity If you encounter
an error, the response will contain an error object with the following attributes:
