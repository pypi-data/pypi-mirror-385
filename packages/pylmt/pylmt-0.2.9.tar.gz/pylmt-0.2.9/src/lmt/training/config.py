"""Module for training configuration.

This module defines the BaseTrainingConfig class, which is used to manage
configuration parameters for a machine learning training pipeline.
"""


class BaseTrainingConfig:
    """Base configuration class for defining training parameters.

    This class provides a standard set of parameters required for
    configuring a training run, such as the number of epochs,
    evaluation frequency, learning rate, and device. It also supports
    additional custom parameters via keyword arguments.

    Attributes:
        num_epochs (int): The total number of epochs to train for.
        eval_freq (int): The frequency (in steps) at which to run evaluation.
        eval_iter (int): The number of evaluation steps to run.
        learning_rate (float): The learning rate for the optimizer.
        weight_decay (float): The weight decay for the optimizer.
        batch_size (int): The number of samples per batch.
        device (str): The device to use for training
            (e.g., 'cpu', 'cuda', 'mps').
        save_dir (str): The directory where training artifacts will be saved.
        **kwargs: Any additional configuration parameters.
