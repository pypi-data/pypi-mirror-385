python-agents is an easy to use and powerful AI Agent development framework that implements the REACT (Reasoning and Acting) pattern for building agents with tool-calling capabilities.

The library provides a minimal but powerful abstraction for creating agents that can reason step-by-step and use tools to accomplish complex tasks.

## Features

- **REACT Agent Pattern**: Step-by-step reasoning with tool calling
- **Simple Tool Integration**: Convert Python functions to agent tools automatically
- **Async-First Design**: Built on async/await for efficient concurrent operations
- **OpenRouter Compatible**: Works with any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
