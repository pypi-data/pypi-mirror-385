    """Base HTML ID constants for FastHTML applications.
    
    This class provides centralized HTML ID constants that are commonly used
    across FastHTML applications. All IDs are defined as class attributes
    for IDE autocomplete and type checking.
    
    For IDE Support:
        IDEs like VS Code with Pylance will autocomplete these attributes and warn
        if you try to access non-existent attributes. To add app-specific IDs,
        extend this class:
        
        ```python
        class MyAppHtmlIds(AppHtmlIds):
            CUSTOM_SECTION = "custom-section"
            SIDEBAR = "sidebar"
        ```
    
    Note:
        The typing.Final annotation indicates these are constants that shouldn't
        be reassigned at runtime.
