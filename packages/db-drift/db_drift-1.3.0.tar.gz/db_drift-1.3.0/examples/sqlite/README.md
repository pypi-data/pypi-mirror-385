## Creating the Example Databases
The script `create_2_example_sqlite_dbs.py` can be run to create 2 example SQLite databases with sample schemas and data to be used with this project.

The internal database structure created by the example SQL files is similar to the one created for the Oracle example and is shown in the [yaml file there](../oracle/db-structure.yml)
