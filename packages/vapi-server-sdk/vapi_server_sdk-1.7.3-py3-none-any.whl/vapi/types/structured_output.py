    To provide your own custom system and user prompts for structured output extraction, populate the messages array with your system and user messages. You can specify liquid templating in your system and user messages.
    Between the system or user messages, you must reference either 'transcript' or 'messages' with the '{{}}' syntax to access the conversation history.
    Between the system or user messages, you must reference a variation of the structured output with the '{{}}' syntax to access the structured output definition.
