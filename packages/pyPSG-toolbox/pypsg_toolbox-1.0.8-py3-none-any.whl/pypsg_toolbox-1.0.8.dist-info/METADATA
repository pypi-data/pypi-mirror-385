# *pyPSG* toolbox documentation


## Introduction

Dedicated toolboxes have been developed for the analysis of individual physiological signals.
However, for the purpose of fast and efficient data analysis, there was a need to unify these separate modules.
To address this gap, pyPSG was developed — a Python-based toolbox capable of handling and analyzing various types of physiological signals within a single environment.
The toolbox standardizes the signal processing workflow across data from different sources and also enables the preprocessing of physiological signals for machine learning applications.
During development, modularity was a key consideration to allow future expansion with additional biological signals.



## Description
Input data, raw signals are first unified in the EDF (European Data Format) structure. 
The pipeline processes three parallel signal branches: PPG, ECG, and SpO$_2$. 
Each signal undergoes preprocessing using its corresponding module (pyPPG, pecg, or pobm). 
In the case of PPG and ECG, fiducial points are detected to derive beat-to-beat intervals, which are then forwarded to the mhrv module for HRV/BRV analysis. 
Biomarkers are extracted separately from all three signal types, and the results are aggregated and saved for further data analysis.

## Requirements

### Python requirements:


Python == 3.10

pecg == 2.0.5

pyPPG == 1.0.73

scipy == 1.9.1

numpy == 1.23.2

pandas == 1.4.4

dotmap == 1.3.30

wfdb == 3.4.0

mne == 1.5.0


### System requirements:


To run the ECG wavdet fiducial-points detector [matlab runtime (MCR) 2021a](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) is required.

If you wish to use the epltd peak detector [additional wfdb toolbox](https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb-linux-quick-start.shtml) is required.

If you don't want or can't install this - It's Ok! you can use another peak detector from the package.

## Installation

Available on pip, with the command: **pip install pyPSG-toolbox**

pip project: https://pypi.org/project/pyPSG-toolbox/

### Matlab runtime installation:

Follow the guidelines provided in the link: https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html, and choose the version of 2021a(9.10).
