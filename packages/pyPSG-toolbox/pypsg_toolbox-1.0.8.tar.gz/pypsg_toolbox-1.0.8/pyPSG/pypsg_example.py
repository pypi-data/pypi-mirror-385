    Demonstrates the usage of the pyPSG toolbox to read an EDF file, visualize raw signals,

    :param matlab_path: Path to the MATLAB executable (required for ECG fiducial point detection and HRV computation).

                     Keys can include "ppg", "ecg", and "spo2".
                     Values are the corresponding channel names in the EDF file.
