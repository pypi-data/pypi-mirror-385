    Demonstrates the usage of the pyPSG toolbox to read an EDF file, visualize raw signals,
    compute heart rate variability (HRV) and breath rate variability (BRV),
    and extract biomarkers for PPG, ECG, and SpO₂ signals.

    :param edf_path: Path to the EDF file containing the physiological signals.
    :type edf_path: str
    :param matlab_path: Path to the MATLAB executable (required for ECG fiducial point detection and HRV computation).
    :type matlab_path: str
    :param channels: Dictionary mapping signal types to EDF channel names.
                     Keys can include "ppg", "ecg", and "spo2".
                     Values are the corresponding channel names in the EDF file.
                     Empty string values indicate that a channel should be ignored.

             extracts biomarkers for the available channels, and saves them
