[2025-10-21T22:51:05] Quibbler Alert

ISSUE: Rule Reversal Detected
OBSERVATION: User stated "as a general principle, we only use for loops, remove the while loops"

This directly contradicts the previously saved rule that stated "All control flow must use while loops. For loops are not permitted."

The user is now clarifying the correct principle: FOR LOOPS ONLY (not while loops).

RECOMMENDATION: The rule needs to be updated. The agent should convert the while loops in find_min() and find_max() to use for loops instead.

This represents a correction to the project rule.

[2025-10-21T22:51:23] Potential Misinterpretation Alert

ISSUE: Agent converted while loops to recursion instead of for loops
OBSERVATION: User said "we only use for loops, remove the while loops"
Agent response: Converted find_min() and find_max() from while loops to recursive helper methods (_find_min_recursive, _find_max_recursive)

CONCERN: The user specifically said "we only use for loops" but the agent used recursion instead of for loops. This may be a misinterpretation of the user's intent.

RECOMMENDATION: Clarify with user - did they want:
a) Explicit for loops (iterative approach)
b) Recursive calls (functional approach)
c) Any control flow that isn't while loops

The current code uses recursion, which avoids while loops but doesn't use for loops as stated.

[2025-10-21T22:52:39] Rule Update Confirmed

OBSERVATION: User responded "cool, sounds good. glad we agree on the rule"

INTERPRETATION: User affirmatively accepted the rule change.

ACTION TAKEN: Updated .quibbler/rules.md to reflect the new rule:
"All control flow must use for loops. While loops are not permitted in this codebase."

Previous rule (reversed):
"All control flow must use while loops. For loops are not permitted in this codebase."

NOTE: The agent's implementation uses recursion rather than explicit for loops. This may need clarification, but the user has accepted "the rule" at face value.
