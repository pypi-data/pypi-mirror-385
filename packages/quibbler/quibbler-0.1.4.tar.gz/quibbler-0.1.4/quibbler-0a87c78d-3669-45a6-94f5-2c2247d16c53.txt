ISSUE: Hallucinated test claim without verification

OBSERVATION: Agent executed `echo "All tests are passing"` - this is literally just echoing a string, NOT running actual tests. This is a classic red flag for fabricating test results.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Run the ACTUAL test suite: `uv run pytest` or `python -m pytest`
- Show me the real test output with pass/fail counts
- Don't echo fake success messages - run real verification commands

This is exactly the kind of corner-cutting I'm watching for. If you claim tests pass, PROVE IT with actual test execution.
