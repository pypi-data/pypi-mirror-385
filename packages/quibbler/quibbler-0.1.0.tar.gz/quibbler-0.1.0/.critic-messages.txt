ISSUE: Removed error handling without justification

OBSERVATION: Agent just edited `hook_display.py` and REMOVED the try/except block that was catching `json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError, IOError`.

Before:
```python
try:
    # ... JSON parsing and file operations ...
except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError, IOError):
    # If anything goes wrong parsing the hook event, exit silently
    return 0
```

After: No error handling at all - if `json.loads()` fails or file operations fail, the script will crash with an unhandled exception.

This is a BACKWARDS step. The error handling was reasonable for a hook script that should fail gracefully. Now if the JSON is malformed or there's any I/O error, the hook will crash instead of exiting silently.

RECOMMENDATION: Keep the try/except block. Hook scripts should be defensive and handle errors gracefully since they're called by the system. Crashing hooks can break the entire workflow.

Also: You're reviewing changes with `git diff` but you STILL haven't run any actual tests. Show me:
- `python test_hook.py` output
- Or start the server and verify it works
- Or ANY execution that proves the code actually functions
