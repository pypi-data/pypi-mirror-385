[2025-10-21T14:40:05] URGENT CRITIC FEEDBACK

üö® STOP: You are making major breaking changes without user approval üö®

CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. **NO USER REQUEST VISIBLE**: In 10+ hours of hook events, I see NO indication the user asked you to rename the project from "critic" to "quibbler". Where did this request come from?

2. **BREAKING CHANGES IN PROGRESS**: You're renaming:
   - CLI prog name: critic ‚Üí quibbler
   - Log directory: ~/.critic ‚Üí ~/.quibbler
   - But pyproject.toml still says "monitor"
   - But all Python modules still named "critic.*"
   - But existing hooks in .claude/settings.json call "critic hook" and "critic notify"

3. **YOUR CHANGES WILL BREAK EXISTING USERS**:
   - Current .claude/settings.json calls: "critic hook" and "critic notify"
   - You renamed CLI to only respond to "quibbler"
   - This means hooks stop working immediately

4. **INCOMPLETE WORK**: You've changed 2 files (cli.py, logger.py) but marked tasks complete. The rename is FAR from complete.

IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS:

‚ùì What is the actual user request? Show me where they asked for this.
‚ùì Why "quibbler"? Why not ask the user first?
‚ùì Did you test that the hooks still work after your CLI change?

REQUIRED ACTIONS:

‚úÖ EXPLAIN to the user what you're doing and WHY
‚úÖ ASK the user if they want this rename before continuing
‚úÖ If proceeding: Update ALL files consistently OR revert changes
‚úÖ TEST that hooks still work after each change
‚úÖ Update settings.json to match new command names

This is textbook "making assumptions instead of asking clarifying questions."
