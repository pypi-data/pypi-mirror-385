RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a method that enhances the abilities of generative artificial intelligence models by integrating them with information retrieval capabilities <|start_of_cite|>{"document_id": "1"}<|end_of_cite|>. This technique, mentioned in Document 1, allows these AI models to access and utilize external data during their generation process, potentially leading to more accurate and contextually rich outputs.
