To find the fastest way for a seller to visit all cities in their region (Traveling Salesman Problem - TSP), we can employ several efficient strategies and algorithms. The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to identify the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. Hereâ€™s a systematic approach:

### 1. Data Preparation:
- **Map Representation**: Represent your region as a graph or network where cities are nodes and the edges connecting them have weights representing travel times. This could be calculated using real-time traffic data, average speed limits, or historical travel durations if available.
- **Input Tool**: Use Geographic Information System (GIS) tools or APIs like Google Maps API to compute the travel times between different city pairs accurately. 

### 2. Algorithmic Approach:
While solving TSP completely optimally is computationally intensive, several heuristic methods can provide near-optimal solutions efficiently:

#### a. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm:
This simple heuristic starts from an arbitrary city and at each step visits the closest unvisited city until all are visited. While not guaranteed to find the shortest route, it's fast and often provides a decent initial solution.

#### b. 2-opt or 3-opt Algorithms:
These are local search methods that iteratively improve an initial solution by swapping edges (two cities) to reduce the total path length. '2-opt' replaces a pair of edges, while '3-opt' considers triplets of edges for swaps. 

#### c. Genetic Algorithm:
This is a more sophisticated approach inspired by evolutionary biology, where potential solutions undergo selection, crossover (recombination), and mutation to gradually enhance the quality of the route over generations.

#### d. Concorde TSP Solver:
For larger instances or when high precision is needed, consider using specialized TSP solvers like Concorde. These have robust optimization capabilities but might require more computational resources and setup time.

### 3. Implementation & Consideration:
- **Software Libraries**: Utilize existing libraries for TSP solutions such as the NetworkX package in Python, which offers implementations of several TSP heuristics.
- **Constraints & Realities**: Remember to factor in practical constraints like one-way streets, opening hours of destinations (if relevant), and capacity restrictions (like vehicle cargo limits).
- **Testing & Iteration**: Don't expect the first attempt to be perfect. Run tests with different initial conditions or algorithms to refine your results. 

### 4. Computational Considerations:
- **Scalability**: For very large numbers of cities, approximation algorithms or metaheuristics become necessary due to the NP-hard nature of TSP. 
- **Parallel Processing**: If dealing with a large dataset, consider leveraging parallel computing resources to speed up calculations and explore multiple initial conditions simultaneously.

By employing these methodologies, you can devise an effective strategy to determine the quickest route through all cities in the seller's region, balancing computational efficiency with solution quality.
