      know, when you have money that grown big after your piggy bank, some people

      call them tax planners or accountants). \n\nGenerally, they will tell you that
      it''s good if you keep a few special coins in your piggy bank for ''tax time''.
      This way, when big adults ask about it during their counts, they might give
      you some extra toys. (This is like deductions and credits in taxes). \n\nBut

      are different! It''s smartest to talk to a mature helper who knows these rules
      (tax professional) for the best answer.","index":0,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":84,"completion_tokens":183,"total_tokens":267}}
