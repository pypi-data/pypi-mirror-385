      good! Rex must love exploring outside, while Lucy probably enjoys her cozy indoor
      life.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>user<|end_of_role|>But is he more likely

      Given the conversation history above and the specific query provided in the
      ''query_to_rewrite'' role, rewrite that query into a standalone question that
      captures the user''s intent without requiring the conversation context. If the
      query is already clear and standalone, output it as is.\nYour output should
      be a JSON structure with the rewritten question:\n```json\n{\n    \"rewritten_question\":
      \"YOUR_REWRITTEN_QUESTION_HERE\"\n}\n```<|end_of_role|>","max_tokens":256,"seed":42,"temperature":0.0,"guided_regex":"```json\\n\\{\\s*\\\"rewritten_question\\\"\\s*:\\s*\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\"\\s*\\}\\n```"}'
