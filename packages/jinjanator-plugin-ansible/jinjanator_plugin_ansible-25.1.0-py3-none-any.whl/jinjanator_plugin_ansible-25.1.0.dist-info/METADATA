# *jinjanator-plugin-ansible*: Makes Ansible's filters and tests available in jinjanator



This plugin makes all of the filters and tests from the Ansible 'core'
collection available to templates being rendered using the jinjanator
tool.

## Installation

```
pip install jinjanator-plugin-ansible
```

## Usage

The Ansible filters and tests can be used in templates using the same
names that would be used if the template was rendered by Ansible
itself.
## Release Information
### Backwards-incompatible Changes

- Support for Python 3.9 has been removed, and support for Python 3.14
  has been added. Since the minimum supported version is now 3.10, the
  code has been updated to use features introduced in that version.
  
- Upgraded to version 25.1.0 of jinjanator-plugins.
  


### Additions

- Added testing against Python 3.13 (again).
