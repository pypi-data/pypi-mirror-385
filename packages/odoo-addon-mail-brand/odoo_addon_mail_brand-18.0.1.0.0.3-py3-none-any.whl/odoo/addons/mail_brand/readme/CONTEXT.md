**In summary:**

The module prioritizes automatic branding based on the originating
record. If no brand is associated with the record, or if you need to
override it, you can manually select a brand in the "Compose Email"
wizard. Ensure your brands are correctly configured with linked partners
and logos for the branding to appear in your outgoing emails.
