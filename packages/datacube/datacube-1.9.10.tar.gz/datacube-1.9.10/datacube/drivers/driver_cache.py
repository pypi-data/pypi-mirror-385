    Load available drivers for a given group name.

    Gracefully handles:

     - Driver module not able to be imported
     - Driver init function throwing an exception or returning None

     By having driver entry_points pointing to a function, we defer loading the driver
     module or running any code until required.

    :param group: Name of the entry point group e.g. "datacube.plugins.io.read"
