Versalign is a naive alignment tool for lists of arbitrary objects. Versalign is able to perform pairwise sequence alignments and star-based multiple sequence alignments, based on custom scoring functions. Versalign is primarily designed to align short-ish sequences.

Versalign is a Python library and has no command line interface.

Pairwise alignments, which is the core of this library, is built around Biopython's `PairwiseAligner` class.

## Installation

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/moltools/versalign.git
```

The latest stable release can be installed from PyPI with:

```shell
pip install versalign
```

Versalign has been developed for Linux and MacOS.

## Getting started

See the [examples](examples/) folder for some basic usage examples.
