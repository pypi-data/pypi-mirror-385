        The relative paths to files or folders inside the LOCAL_PATH that will be uploaded. Paths are provided with support for Unix shell-style wildcards.

        You can only provide either --include-paths or --exclude-paths,  not both.

        Supported wildcards:
        \* - matches any number of characters
        ? - matches any single character

        E.g. taskName/out?/\*.txt matches any .txt file in folders taskName/out1, taskName/out2, etc.

        E.g. taskName???/folder/file.txt matches taskName001/folder/file.txt, taskName123/folder/file.txt, etc.

        To specify multiple paths, this option may be provided multiple times or deliminated by a comma (``,``). To escape a comma, use two commas (``,,``).

        E.g. --include-paths "path1" --include-paths "path2"
