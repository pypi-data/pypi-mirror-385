cyndilib
########

A Python wrapper for `NDI®`_ written in `Cython`_


Description
***********

NDI® allows video and audio to be reliably sent and received over IP with
minimal latency and very high quality. For more information see https://ndi.video.

This project aims to wrap most functionality of the `NDI® SDK`_ for use in
Python. Due to the real-time nature of audio and video, nearly all of this
library is written in `Cython`_ for performance purposes. By design, "cyndilib"
may be used within other Cython code.

Installation
************


From PyPI
=========

This project is available on PyPI with pre-built wheels for most
platforms. Installing via `pip`_ would be the simplest method of
installation::

    pip install cyndilib

All of the necessary headers and Cython ``.pxd`` files will be included
in the distribution. This will allow for direct integration if using
Cython in your application using the ``cimport`` statement.
See the `Cython documentation <https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/sharing_declarations.html>`_
for more details.


Building from Source
====================

This may be necessary if a pre-built wheel is not available for
your platform or Python version.

First clone or download the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/nocarryr/cyndilib.git
    cd cyndilib


The project can then be installed with::

    pip install .


All of the dependencies for building and installation should be automatically
detected and installed (assuming your system supports the `build metadata`_
specifications introduced `PEP 517`_).

.. note::

    The ``.`` in the above command implies that you are in the root directory
    of the cloned project.  For other uses, the path to the project root may
    be used instead.


Parallel Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are quite a few sources to compile and by default, they will be compiled
one at a time.  There is currently not a direct way to tell pip to use multiple
threads when compiling.

An environment variable ``CYNDILIB_BUILD_PARALLEL`` may be used to work around
this however.  Its value can be either a specific number of threads to use
or ``"auto"`` to use all available cores::

    CYNDILIB_BUILD_PARALLEL=auto pip install .


Further Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

More information on compilation and development can be found on the
`development page <https://cyndilib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html>`_
of the project documentation.


Usage
*****

Documentation can be found at https://cyndilib.readthedocs.io.
Since this project is still in its early stages of development however,
a look at the example code and tests in the repository might be more useful.

`NDI® SDK Documentation`_.
