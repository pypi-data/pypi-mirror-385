leanclient is a thin Python wrapper around the native Lean 4 language server.
It enables interaction with a Lean 4 language server instance running in a subprocess.

Check out the [documentation](https://leanclient.readthedocs.io) for more information.

## Key Features

- **Interact**: Query and change lean files via the [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/).
- **Thin wrapper**: Directly expose the [Lean Language Server](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/src/Lean/Server).
- **Fast**: Typically more than 95% of time is spent waiting.
- **Parallel**: Easy batch processing of files using all your cores.

## Quickstart

The best way to get started is to check out this minimal example in Google Colab:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/oOo0oOo/leanclient/blob/main/examples/getting_started_leanclient.ipynb)

Or try it locally:

1) Setup a new lean project or use an existing one. See the [colab notebook](examples/getting_started_leanclient.ipynb) for a basic Ubuntu setup.

2) Install the package:

```bash
pip install leanclient
# Or with uv:
uv pip install leanclient
```

3) In your python code:

```python
import leanclient as lc

# Start a new client, point it to your lean project root (where lakefile.toml is located).
PROJECT_PATH = "path/to/your/lean/project/root/"
client = lc.LeanLSPClient(PROJECT_PATH)

# Query a lean file in your project
file_path = "MyProject/Basic.lean"
result = client.get_goal(file_path, line=0, character=2)
print(result)

# Use a SingleFileClient for simplified interaction with a single file.
sfc = client.create_file_client(file_path)
result = sfc.get_term_goal(line=0, character=5)
print(result)

# Make a change to the document.
change = lc.DocumentContentChange(text="-- Adding a comment at the head of the file\n", start=[0, 0], end=[0, 0])
sfc.update_file(changes=[change])

# Check the document content as seen by the LSP (changes are not written to disk).
print(sfc.get_file_content())
```

### Implemented LSP Interactions

See the [documentation](https://leanclient.readthedocs.io) for more information on:

- Opening and closing files.
- Updating (adding/removing) code from an open file.
- Diagnostic information: Errors, warnings and information.
- Goals and term goal.
- Hover information.
- Document symbols (theorems, definitions, etc).
- Semantic tokens, folding ranges, and document highlights.
- Locations of definitions and type definitions.
- Locations of declarations and references.
- Completions, completion item resolve.
- Getting code actions, resolving them, then applying the edits.
- Get InfoTrees of theorems (includes rudimentary parsing).

### Missing LSP Interactions

- "Call hierarchy" is currently not reliable.

Might be implemented in the future:

- `workspace/symbol`, `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`, `workspace/applyEdit`, ...
- `textDocument/prepareRename`, `textDocument/rename`

Internal Lean methods:

- `$/lean/rpc/connect`, `$/lean/rpc/call`, `$/lean/rpc/release`, `$/lean/rpc/keepAlive`
- Interactive diagnostics
- `$/lean/staleDependency`

### Potential Features

- Better Windows support
- Choose between `lean --server` and `lake serve`
- Automatic testing (lean env setup) for non Debian-based systems

## Benchmarks

See [documentation](https://leanclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks.html) for more information.

## Testing

```bash
make install            # Installs python package and dev dependencies with uv
make test               # Run all tests, also installs fresh lean env if not found
make test-profile       # Run all tests with cProfile
```
