# WorkOS Python Library

![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/workos)
[![Build Status](https://workos.semaphoreci.com/badges/workos-python/branches/main.svg?style=shields&key=9e4cb5bb-86a4-4938-9ec2-fc9f9fc512be)](https://workos.semaphoreci.com/projects/workos-python)

The WorkOS library for Python provides convenient access to the WorkOS API from applications written in Python, [hosted on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/workos/)

## Documentation

See the [API Reference](https://workos.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) for Python usage examples.

## Installation

To install from PyPi, run the following:

```
pip install workos
```

To install from source, clone the repo and run the following:

```
python setup.py install
```

## Configuration

The package will need to be configured with your [api key and client ID](https://dashboard.workos.com/api-keys).

```python
from workos import WorkOSClient

workos_client = WorkOSClient(
    api_key="sk_1234", client_id="client_1234"
)
```

The SDK also provides asyncio support for some SDK methods, via the async client:

```python
from workos import AsyncWorkOSClient

async_workos_client = AsyncWorkOSClient(
    api_key="sk_1234", client_id="client_1234"
)
```

## SDK Versioning

For our SDKs WorkOS follows a Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) process where all releases will have a version X.Y.Z (like 1.0.0) pattern wherein Z would be a bug fix (e.g., 1.0.1), Y would be a minor release (1.1.0) and X would be a major release (2.0.0). We permit any breaking changes to only be released in major versions and strongly recommend reading changelogs before making any major version upgrades.

## Beta Releases

WorkOS has features in Beta that can be accessed via Beta releases. We would love for you to try these
and share feedback with us before these features reach general availability (GA). To install a Beta version,
please follow the [installation steps](#installation) above using the Beta release version.

> Note: there can be breaking changes between Beta versions. Therefore, we recommend pinning the package version to a
> specific version. This way you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are
> intentionally looking for the latest Beta version.

We highly recommend keeping an eye on when the Beta feature you are interested in goes from Beta to stable so that you
can move to using the stable version.
