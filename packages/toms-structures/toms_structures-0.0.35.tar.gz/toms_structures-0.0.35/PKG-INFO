## Description

A library of structural engineering calculations which are commonly calculated using either excel spreadsheets or by hand.
This project aims to fill the gap between expensive full blown industry software (e.g. FEA tools such as spacegass/ETABS/etc) which are reliable and correct but not warranted on smaller scale projects,
and the world of excel spreadsheets and hand calculations, which are often difficult to maintain, program, version, and test accurately but used extensively for small projects or isolated checking.

This project is currently in early alpha.
