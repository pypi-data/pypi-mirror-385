    GraphPass Utility to modify QcQuantizeOp from ConnectedGraph

    Flow:
        1. Iterate over each Op in ConnectedGraph
        2. Check for pattern match
            - Specified by `match_pattern`
            - User to inherit `SupergroupGraphPass` and specify `match_pattern` for specific sub-graph
        3. If pattern matches, calls `disable_quantizers`
            - This by default disables quantization for all collected quantizer names
            - If intent is to set quantization options differently, override `disable_quantizers`

    How to use SupergroupGraphPass?
        1. Inherit SupergroupGraphPass and implement `match_pattern` to capture
            - Pattern of interest
            - Ops to disable output quantizers
        2. If disabling output quantization for intermediate ops, you are done and can skip 3.
        3. If need special handling for quantizers, override `disable_quantizers`
            - In this case, you can capture more variables in `match_pattern` as required
