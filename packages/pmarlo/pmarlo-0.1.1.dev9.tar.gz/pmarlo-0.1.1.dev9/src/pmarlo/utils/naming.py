"""Helpers for reproducible naming of remaps and permutations.

These functions provide small cached layers that convert array shapes and
permutation mappings into deterministic strings.  By caching the results
we ensure that repeated calls across a workflow yield identical objects,
which simplifies logging and makes debugging across passes repeatable.
