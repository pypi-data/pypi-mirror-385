    """Apply the stored output whitening transform when available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Y:
        Raw collective variable projections ``(n_frames, n_cvs)``.
    mean:
        Per-component mean recorded during training.  Accepts any sequence-like
        object convertible to ``float``.
    W:
        Whitening matrix (typically the inverse Cholesky factor of the output
        covariance).  Accepts array-likes convertible to ``float``.
    already_applied:
        Flag indicating whether the transform has already been applied.  When
        ``True`` the input array is returned unchanged.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Transformed CVs with unit variance when the metadata is available.

    Notes
    -----
    All whitening metadata must be present.  Missing ``mean`` or ``W`` values
    raise a ``ValueError`` so callers surface configuration issues immediately.
    Shape mismatches likewise raise a ``ValueError`` to avoid silently
    continuing with inconsistent transforms.  After applying the transform the
    outputs are re-centered using float64 precision to eliminate tiny residual
    mean drift that accumulates for large batches.  When enough frames are
    available the function also performs a final whitening pass against the
    observed batch covariance so the returned projections have unit variance
    even when the stored metadata came from a different sample.
