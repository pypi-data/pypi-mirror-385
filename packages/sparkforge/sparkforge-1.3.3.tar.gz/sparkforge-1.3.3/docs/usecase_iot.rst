IoT Data Processing Use Case
============================

This guide demonstrates building an IoT sensor data pipeline using SparkForge for real-time analytics and monitoring.

Overview
--------

Process high-volume sensor data from IoT devices to create real-time dashboards and predictive analytics.

Key Features
------------

- **Stream Processing**: Handle high-frequency sensor data
- **Real-time Analytics**: Process data as it arrives
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecast equipment failures

Pipeline Components
------------------

**Bronze Layer**: Raw sensor data ingestion
**Silver Layer**: Data cleaning and feature engineering
**Gold Layer**: Analytics and alerts
