"""
Dependency analysis system for the framework pipelines.

This package provides a unified dependency analysis system that replaces
both DependencyAnalyzer and UnifiedDependencyAnalyzer with a single,
more maintainable solution.

Key Features:
- Single analyzer for all step types
- Dependency graph construction
- Cycle detection and resolution
- Execution group optimization
- Performance analysis
