Progressive Examples
====================

This guide provides step-by-step examples that build complexity gradually, from simple pipelines to advanced use cases.

Learning Path
-------------

**Level 1: Basic Pipeline**
- Simple Bronze validation
- Single Silver transformation
- Basic Gold aggregation

**Level 2: Intermediate Pipeline**
- Multiple Bronze sources
- Silver dependencies
- Complex transformations

**Level 3: Advanced Pipeline**
- Parallel execution
- Incremental processing
- Error handling and recovery

**Level 4: Production Pipeline**
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and alerting
- Scalable architecture

Example Structure
-----------------

Each example includes:
- **Objective**: What you'll learn
- **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge
- **Code**: Complete working example
- **Explanation**: How it works
- **Next Steps**: How to extend it
