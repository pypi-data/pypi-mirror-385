Writer Module - Refactored with Modular Architecture

Enhanced log writer for PipelineBuilder reports with full framework integration.
This module provides a comprehensive logging and reporting system for pipeline
execution results, integrating seamlessly with the existing the ecosystem.

Architecture:
- Core: Main LogWriter class that orchestrates all components
- Operations: Data processing and transformation operations
- Storage: Delta Lake and table management operations
- Monitoring: Performance tracking and metrics collection
- Analytics: Data quality analysis and trend detection

Key Features:
- Full integration with framework models (StepResult, ExecutionResult, PipelineMetrics)
- Enhanced type safety with proper TypedDict definitions
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Flexible configuration system
- Delta Lake integration for persistent logging
- Modular architecture for better maintainability

Classes:
    LogWriter: Main writer class for pipeline log operations
    DataProcessor: Handles data processing and transformations
    StorageManager: Manages Delta Lake storage operations
    PerformanceMonitor: Tracks performance metrics
    AnalyticsEngine: Provides analytics and trend analysis
    DataQualityAnalyzer: Analyzes data quality metrics
    TrendAnalyzer: Analyzes execution trends

Functions:
    flatten_execution_result: Convert ExecutionResult to log rows
    create_log_schema: Create Spark schema for log tables
    validate_log_data: Validate log data before writing

Example:
    from the framework.writer import LogWriter, WriterConfig
    from the framework.models import ExecutionResult

    # Configure writer
    config = WriterConfig(
        table_schema="analytics",
        table_name="pipeline_logs",
        write_mode=WriteMode.APPEND
    )

    # Create writer
    writer = LogWriter(spark, config)

    # Write execution result
    result = writer.write_execution_result(execution_result)
