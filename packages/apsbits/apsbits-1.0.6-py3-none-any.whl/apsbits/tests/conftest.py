Pytest fixtures for instrument tests.

This module provides fixtures for initializing the RunEngine with devices,
allowing tests to operate with device-dependent configurations without relying
on the production startup logic.

Fixtures:
    runengine_with_devices: A RunEngine object in a session with devices configured.
