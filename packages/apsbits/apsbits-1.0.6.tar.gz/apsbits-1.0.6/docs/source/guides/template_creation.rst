   Alternatively, you can open the template in a codespace and publish your work to a new repository later. For more information, see `Creating a codespace from a template <https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-from-a-template>`_.

4. Use the Owner dropdown menu to select the account you want to own the repository.
