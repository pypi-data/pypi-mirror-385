    Breaking Changes
    ----------------

    * **Callback file renaming**: Demo callback files renamed to follow `_demo` naming convention:

      * ``nexus_data_file_writer.py`` → ``demo_nexus_callback.py``
      * ``spec_data_file_writer.py`` → ``demo_spec_callback.py``

      Import paths updated in startup.py. Direct imports of these modules will need updating.

    * **DM plans removed**: The ``dm_plans.py`` file has been removed to reduce apstools dependency.
      DM configuration infrastructure remains in iconfig.yml and startup.py.

    * **StoredDict implementation**: Now uses local implementation instead of ``apstools.utils.StoredDict``.
      This reduces external dependencies while maintaining full compatibility.

    Enhancements
    ------------

    * **Improved error handling**: Enhanced error messages with specific exception types and detailed context across core modules (device loading, configuration parsing, RunEngine initialization, databroker catalog setup).

    * **Complete type annotations**: Added comprehensive type annotations to all public APIs for better IDE support and code maintainability.

    * **Code quality improvements**: Added ``py.typed`` marker for mypy support and improved code formatting compliance.

* make_devices() is noisy
* Why does make_devices() add all ophyd.sim simulator objects to ophyd registry?

* QS restart does not restart when QS was running
