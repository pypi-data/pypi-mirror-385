"""
Concatenates the measures from two or more scores into another score.

The purpose of this script is to allow you to work on a section of a very long
composition, without "lag" slowing you down. When MuseScore has to interpret
and render a very long score, it gets a little slow. Breaking a long
composition down into parts gets around that, making your composing experience
more pleasant.

Note that all sources MUST have the same part / instrument structure.
