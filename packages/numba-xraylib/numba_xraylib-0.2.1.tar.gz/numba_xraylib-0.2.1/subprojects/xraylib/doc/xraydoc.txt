This x-ray transition table provides the energies (in eV) for K transitions  connecting the K shell (n = 1) to the shells with principal quantum numbers  n = 2 to 4 and L transitions connecting the L1, L2, and L3 shells (n = 2) to the shells with principal quantum numbers n = 3 and 4. The elements covered  include Z = 10, neon to Z = 100, fermium.
