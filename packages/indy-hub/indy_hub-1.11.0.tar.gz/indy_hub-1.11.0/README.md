## Quick Install

1. `pip install django-eveuniverse` and `pip install indy_hub`

- `EVEUNIVERSE_LOAD_TYPE_MATERIALS = True`
- `EVEUNIVERSE_LOAD_MARKET_GROUPS = True`

1. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

1. Populate EveUniverse with industry data `python manage.py eveuniverse_load_data types --types-enabled-sections industry_activities type_materials`.

## Configuration

These settings are optional and let you tune background behaviour:

- `INDY_HUB_DISCORD_DM_ENABLED` (bool, default: `True`): enable Discord DM notifications via `aadiscordbot`, falling back to `discordnotify` when available.
- `INDY_HUB_MANUAL_REFRESH_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` (int, default: `3600`): minimum delay (in seconds) before the same user can trigger another manual sync for blueprints or jobs.
- `INDY_HUB_BULK_UPDATE_WINDOW_MINUTES` (int, default: `720`): maximum window (in minutes) used to stagger large background synchronisations. You can further refine the cadence with:
  - `INDY_HUB_BLUEPRINTS_BULK_WINDOW_MINUTES` (default: `720`, twelve hours).
  - `INDY_HUB_INDUSTRY_JOBS_BULK_WINDOW_MINUTES` (default: `120`, two hours).

Scheduled tasks are automatically created or updated on startup:

- `indy-hub-update-all-blueprints` runs daily at 03:00 UTC and spreads user refreshes across the configured window.
- `indy-hub-update-all-industry-jobs` runs every two hours and staggers its workload across the job window.

After upgrading, restart your Celery workers and Celery Beat to apply the new schedule.

- Assign the `indy_hub.can_manage_corporate_assets` permission to directors who should access the corporation dashboard and manage cross-corporation sharing.
- The corporation dashboard now exposes per-corporation copy sharing settings backed by `CorporationSharingSetting`.
