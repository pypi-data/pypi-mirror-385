## **About the author**
Hi, I'm Jaime. I wrote Mann.rs during my PhD on dynamic wind farm modelling. At the time, I needed to generate extremely large, high-resolution turbulence boxes—but no existing software could handle that scale efficiently. So I revisited the Mann turbulence model and implemented several numerical optimizations which significantly improved the memory and computational efficiency of the model.

Mann.rs is the result of that work. It’s designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to integrate into simulation workflows. I’m happy to share it with the world as open source code, and I hope it proves useful to others working in wind energy, atmospheric modeling, or anywhere where synthetic turbulence is needed.
