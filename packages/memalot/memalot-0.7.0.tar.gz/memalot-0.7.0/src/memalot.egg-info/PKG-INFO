Memalot finds [memory leaks](#definition-of-a-leak) in Python programs. Memalot prints suspected leaks to the console by default, and also has a [CLI](#cli) and an [MCP server](#mcp-server) for analyzing memory leaks.  

For example, here is a Python program which creates a string object every half-second and stores these in a list:

```python
from time import sleep
import memalot

memalot.start_leak_monitoring(max_object_lifetime=1.0)

def my_function():
    my_list = []
    for i in range(100000):
        my_list.append(f"Object {i}")
        sleep(0.5)

my_function()
```

In this example, the `memalot.start_leak_monitoring(max_object_lifetime=1.0)` line tells Memalot to find objects that have lived for longer than one second and identity them as potential leaks. After a short delay, Memalot will print a report like this to the console:

<img width="541" height="584" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca07a085-aaee-4332-96bf-6a43d98fa161" />

Memalot has identified that some string objects are leaking, and has printed details about the first object, including its referrers (the references to the object that are keeping it alive), its size and its string representation. 

**Note**: Memalot may slow down your program, so be wary of using it in a production system.

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip3 install memalot
```

## Getting Started

Memalot can identify suspected memory leaks in one of these ways:

- [Time-based Leak Discovery](#time-based-leak-discovery). Identifies objects that have lived for more than a certain amount of time without being garbage collected. This is most suitable for web servers and other programs that process short-lived requests, and multithreaded programs. 
- [Function-based Leak Discovery](#iteration-based-leak-discovery). Identifies objects that have been created while a specific function is being called, but have not yet been garbage collected. This is most suitable for single-threaded batch processing systems or other long-lived jobs.

### Time-based Leak Discovery

To get started with time-based leak discovery, call this code after your Python program starts:

```python
import memalot

memalot.start_leak_monitoring(max_object_lifetime=60.0)
```

This will periodically print out potential memory leaks to the console. An object is considered a potential leak if it lives for more than `max_object_lifetime` seconds (in this case, 60 seconds).

By default, Memalot has a warm-up period equal to `max_object_lifetime` seconds. Objects created during the warm-up period will not be identified as leaks. You can control the warm-up period using the `warmup_period` parameter.

### Function-based Leak Discovery

To get started with function-based leak discovery, wrap your code in the `@leak_monitor` decorator:

```python
from memalot import leak_monitor

@leak_monitor
def function_that_leaks_memory():
    # Code that leaks memory here
```

When the function exits, Memalot will print out potential memory leaks. That is, objects created while the function was being called, which cannot be garbage collected.

You can also ask Memalot to only consider objects that have lived for more than a certain number of calls to the function. For example: 

```python
from memalot import leak_monitor

@leak_monitor
def function_that_leaks_memory(max_object_age_calls=2):
    # Code that leaks memory here
```

In this case the `max_object_age_calls=2` parameter asks Memalot to only consider _objects that have been created while the function was being called, and have survived two calls to the function_.

Function-based leak discovery may not be accurate if other threads are creating objects outside the function while it is being called. Memalot cannot detect objects that are created _within_ a specific function, only _while the function is being called_. If this causes problems for you, use [time-based Leak Discovery](#time-based-leak-discovery) instead.

Note: you should *not* call `memalot.start_leak_monitoring` when using function-based leak discovery.

## Filtering

Memalot can be used to filter the types of objects that are considered leaks. This can speed up leak discovery significantly if you know what types of objects are likely to be leaks.

To filter object types, pass the `included_type_names` parameter with the type names that you wish to include. For example:

```python
memalot.start_leak_monitoring(max_object_lifetime=60.0, included_type_names={"mypackage.MyObject", "OtherObject"})
```

This will only include objects with `mypackage.MyObject` or `OtherObject` in their fully qualified type name. Matching is based on substrings, so `mypackage.MyObject` will match `mypackage.MyObjectSubclass` as well.

You can also exclude certain types of objects from being considered as leaks. Use the `excluded_type_names` option for this. For example:

```python
memalot.start_leak_monitoring(max_object_lifetime=60.0, included_type_names={"builtins"}, excluded_type_names={"dict"})
```

This will include all built-in types except for `dict`.

One efficient way to use Memalot is to generate a report with `check_referrers=False` to see which types of objects might be leaking, and then generate further reports with `check_referrers=True` and `included_type_names` set to the types of objects that you think may be leaking. Since finding referrers is slow, this can speed up leak discovery.

## Console Output

By default, Memalot prints out suspected leaks to the console. However, you can specify the `output_func` option to send the output to a different location. For example, to send the output to a Python logger:

```python
LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)
memalot.start_leak_monitoring(max_object_lifetime=60.0, output_func=LOG.info)
```

## Saved Reports

Memalot saves leak reports to disk, which can be inspected later via the [CLI](#cli) or [MCP server](#mcp-server). By default reports are saved to the `.memalot/reports` directory in the user's home directory, but this can be changed by setting the `report_directory` option.

Reports can be copied between machines by copying the contents of the `report_directory` to the other machine (using, for example, `scp` or `rsync`). This is useful if, for example, you are running Memalot in your test environment but want to inspect reports on your local machine.

For example, to copy the report with ID `rcf1-6kks` from a remote machine to your local machine:

```bash
scp alice@remote_host:/home/alice/.memalot/reports/memalot_report_rcf1-6kks /home/alice/.memalot/reports/
```

Or to rsync all reports from a remote machine to your local machine:

```bash
rsync -avh --progress alice@remote_host:/home/alice/.memalot/reports/ /home/alice/.memalot/reports/
```

There is a small chance of report ID collisions if you copy reports between machines (although this is relatively unlikely, since report IDs are 8 alphanumeric characters). To avoid report collisions, use a different `report_directory` for each machine you copy reports from.

## CLI

Memalot has a basic CLI that can be used to analyze memory leaks.

To list leaks, run:

```bash
memalot list
```

To print a report for a specific leak, run:

```bash
memalot print <report_id>
```

To get help, run a command with the `--help` flag. For example:

```bash
memalot print --help
```

## MCP Server

TODO: Write this section.

## Options

Memalot has a number of options that can be used to customize its behavior. Pass these options to `start_leak_monitoring` or `@leak_monitor`. For example:

```python
memalot.start_leak_monitoring(max_object_lifetime=60.0, force_terminal=True, max_object_details=50)
```

### Type Filtering

- **`included_type_names`** (set of strings, default: empty set): The types of objects to include in the report. By default all types are checked, but this can be limited to a subset of types. Inclusion is based on substring matching of the fully-qualified type name (the name of the type and its module). For example, if `included_type_names` is set to `{"numpy"}`, all NumPy types will be included in the report.

- **`excluded_type_names`** (set of strings, default: empty set): The types of objects to exclude from the report. By default no types are excluded. Exclusion is based on substring matching of the fully-qualified type name (the name of the type and its module). For example, if `excluded_type_names` is set to `{"numpy"}`, all NumPy types will be excluded from the report.

### Leak Report Options

- **`max_types_in_leak_summary`** (int, default: 500): The maximum number of types to include in the leak summary.

- **`compute_size_in_leak_summary`** (bool, default: False): Computes the (shallow) size of all objects in the leak summary. Note: the shallow size of an object may not be particularly meaningful, since most objects refer to other objects, and often don't contain much data themselves.

- **`max_object_details`** (int, default: 30): The maximum number of objects for which to print details. We try to check at least one object for each object type, within this limit. If the number of types exceeds this limit, then we check only the most common types. If the number of types is less than this limit, then we will check more objects for more common types.

### Referrer Tracking Options

- **`check_referrers`** (bool, default: True): Whether to check for referrers of leaked objects. This option may cause a significant slow-down (but provides useful information). Try setting this to `False` if Memalot is taking a long time to generate object details. Then, when you have an idea of what types of objects are leaking, you can generate reports with `check_referrers=True` and `included_type_names` set to the types of objects that you think may be leaking.

- **`referrers_max_depth`** (int or None, default: 50): The maximum depth to search for referrers. Specify `None` to search to unlimited depth (but be careful with this: it may take a long time).

- **`referrers_search_timeout`** (float or None, default: 300.0): The maximum time in seconds to spend searching for referrers for an individual object. If this time is exceeded, a partial graph is displayed and the referrer graph will contain a node containing the text "Timeout of N seconds exceeded". Note that this timeout is approximate, and may not be effective if the search is blocked by a long-running operation. The default is 5 minutes (300 seconds). Setting this to `None` will disable the timeout.

- **`single_object_referrer_limit`** (int or None, default: 100): The maximum number of referrers to include in the graph for an individual object instance. If the limit is exceeded, the referrer graph will contain a node containing the text "Referrer limit of N exceeded". Note that this limit is approximate and does not apply to all referrer types. Specifically, it only applies to object references. Additionally, this limit does not apply to immortal objects.

- **`referrers_module_prefixes`** (set of strings or None, default: None): The prefixes of the modules to search for module-level variables when looking for referrers. If this is not specified, the top-level package of the calling code is used.

- **`referrers_max_untracked_search_depth`** (int, default: 30): The maximum depth to search for referrers of untracked objects. This is the depth that referents will be searched from the roots (locals and globals). If you are missing referrers of untracked objects, you can increase this value.

### Report Storage Options

- **`save_reports`** (bool, default: True): Whether to save reports to disk. This is useful for inspecting them later. Reports are written to the `report_directory`, or the default directory if this is not specified.

- **`report_directory`** (Path or None, default: None): The directory to write the report data to. Individual report data is written to a subdirectory of this directory. If this is `None` (the default), the default directory will be used. This is the `.memalot/reports` directory in the user's home directory. To turn off saving of reports entirely, use the `save_reports` option.

### Output Options

- **`str_func`** (callable or None, default: None): A function for outputting the string representation of an object. The first argument is the object and the second argument is the length to truncate the string to, as specified by `str_max_length`. If this is not supplied the object's `__str__` is used.

- **`str_max_length`** (int, default: 100): The maximum length of object string representations, as passed to `str_func`.

- **`force_terminal`** (bool or None, default: None): Forces the use of terminal control codes, which enable colors and other formatting. Defaults to `False`, as this is normally detected automatically. Set this to `True` if you are missing colors or other formatting in the output, as sometimes (like when running in an IDE) the terminal is not detected correctly. This must be set to `False` if `output_func` is set and `tee_console` is `False`.

- **`output_func`** (callable or None, default: None): A function that writes reports. If this is not provided reports are printed to the console. This option can be used to, for example, write reports to a log file. If this option is specified then output is not written to the console, unless `tee_console` is set to `True`.

- **`tee_console`** (bool, default: False): If this is set to `True`, output is written to the console as well as to the function specified by `output_func`. If `output_func` is not specified (the default) then this option has no effect.

- **`color`** (bool, default: True): Specifies whether colors should be printed to the console. Note: in certain consoles (like when running in an IDE), colors are not printed by default. Try setting `force_terminal` to `True` if this happens.

### Other Options

- **`max_untracked_search_depth`** (int, default: 3): The maximum search depth when looking for leaked objects that are not tracked by the garbage collector. Untracked objects include, for example, mutable objects and collections containing only immutable objects in CPython. This defaults to 3, which is enough to find most untracked objects. However, this may not be sufficient to find some untracked objects, like nested tuples. Increase this if you have nested collections of immutable objects (like tuples). However, note that increasing this may impact speed.

## Context Manager

Memalot _can_ be used as a context manager. However, it is generally recommended to use the `@leak_monitor` decorator instead, unless this is not possible.

To use Memalot as a context manager, call `create_leak_monitor` once, and then use the returned object as a context manager each time you want to monitor memory leaks. For example:

```python
monitor = create_leak_monitor()

with monitor:
    # Code that leaks memory here
```

Note: it is important to call `create_leak_monitor` only once and reuse the returned object each time you want to monitor memory leaks.

## Definition of a Leak

Memalot defines a memory leak as _an object that has lived for longer than is necessary_.

However, note that Memalot cannot distinguish between objects that live for a long time when this is _necessary_ (for example, you want to cache some objects for speed) and when this is _unnecessary_ (for example, you forget to evict stale objects from your cache). It's up to you to make this distinction.

## Known Limitations

- Memalot is slow. Be wary of using it in a production system.
- Memalot does not guarantee to find *all* leaking objects. If you have leaking objects that are
  created very rarely, Memalot may not detect them. Specifically:
  - Memalot does not find objects that are created while the leak report is being generated. This is mostly applicable to time-based leak discovery.
  - If the `max_object_age_calls` parameter is set to greater than 1 during function-based leak discovery, Memalot will not find objects that are created on some calls to the function.
