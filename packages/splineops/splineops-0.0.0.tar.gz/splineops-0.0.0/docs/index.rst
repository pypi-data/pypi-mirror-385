SplineOps: Spline Operations
============================

**SplineOps** is an open-source software library written in Python. It provides efficient signal-processing tools based on splines. 
Adapted and built on the algorithms developed through the years by the `Biomedical Imaging Group at EPFL <https://bigwww.epfl.ch/>`_ (Lausanne, Switzerland), 
SplineOps is in active development and supports modern computational demands.

With a focus on the handling of large datasets, SplineOps deploys both CPU and GPU computations and offers tools for data smoothing, interpolation, 
and other applications. The library aims to integrate with the PyData ecosystem and supports a variety of research and engineering needs.

By leveraging modern computing architectures, SplineOps seeks to enhance computational workflows while maintaining the rigor and reliability of the original algorithms.
