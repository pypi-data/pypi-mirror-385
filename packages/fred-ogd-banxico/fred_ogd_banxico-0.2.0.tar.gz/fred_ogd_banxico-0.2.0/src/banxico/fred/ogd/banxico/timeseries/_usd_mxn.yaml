      According to Banxico:
      This historical series is published only for analysis and as reference material.
      It is not intended to be used as an official rate or to settle legal matters,
      therefore Banco de México does not take any responsibility for its use.
      The series is calculated in current or "nuevos pesos" (new pesos).
      The validity of the peso currently in use, came into effect starting January 1, 1993
      and one peso is equivalent of 1,000 (one thousand) of those pesos issued before that date.
      The purpose of this series is to provide information about the conditions prevalent
      in the foreign exchange market in the respective dates. Therefore, it is possible that
      for some periods the monthly average for this series does not exactly match other
      monthly series published, which may use the exchange rate to settle liabilities that apply
      in that specific day.
