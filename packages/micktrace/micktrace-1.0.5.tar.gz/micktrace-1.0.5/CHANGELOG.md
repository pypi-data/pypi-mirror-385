### Changed
- **Handler Type Support** - Added support for `"gcp"` handler type in configuration (in addition to existing `"stackdriver"`)
- **New Handler Files** - Created `gcp.py` and `async_gcp.py` modules for better discoverability and remove CNAME from the root repository
- **Acknowledgments** - Added professional acknowledgments section for integration mentions in README

### Fixed
- **README Examples** - Updated Google Cloud Logging examples to use `"gcp"` handler type instead of `"stackdriver"`
- **Handler Exports** - Updated `handlers/__init__.py` to export GCP handler aliases

- **Automated linting workflow** - GitHub Actions workflow for autopep8 linting on push and pull requests
  - Runs autopep8 checks automatically on `main` and `add-autopep8-wf` branches
  - Provides helpful PR comments with fix instructions when linting fails
  - Includes pip dependency caching for faster CI runs
  - Confirms successful linting with positive feedback comments

### Changed
- Enhanced CI/CD pipeline with automated code quality checks
- Improved developer feedback loop with actionable linting messages

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-10 - Datadog Integration & Packaging
### Added
- Built-in Datadog integration: `DatadogHandler` added to `micktrace.handlers` for easy logs forwarding to Datadog Logs Intake (HTTP).
- Optional extra `datadog` in `pyproject.toml` now installs `datadog` and `requests` when users run `pip install micktrace[datadog]`.
- Example: `examples/datadog_example.py` demonstrating how to configure `micktrace` to send structured logs to Datadog using `DATADOG_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Changed
- Logger factory now recognizes handler type `datadog` when provided in configuration dictionaries.

### Fixed
- Cleanup of temporary test artifacts and improved import-safety for optional integrations.
