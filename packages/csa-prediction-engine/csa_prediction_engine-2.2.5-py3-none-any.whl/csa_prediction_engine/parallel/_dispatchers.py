"""
CSA Relevance Engine: Dispatcher Module for parallel task execution

This module provides dispatcher functions to facilitate the execution of 
prediction tasks in a parallel computing environment. Each dispatcher function 
wraps a specific worker function and allows arguments to be passed in a format 
suitable for multi-threaded or multi-process execution.

Available Dispatcher Functions:
    - dispatch_predict_task: Dispatches a single prediction task to a worker.
    - dispatch_maxfit_task: Dispatches a maximum fit prediction task to a worker.
    - dispatch_grid_task: Dispatches a Grid model prediction task to a worker.
    - dispatch_grid_singularity_task: Dispatches a singularity task for the Grid model.
