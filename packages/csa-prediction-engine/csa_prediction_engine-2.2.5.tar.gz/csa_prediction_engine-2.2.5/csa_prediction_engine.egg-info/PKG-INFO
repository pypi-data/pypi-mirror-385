## 🔍 Key Features

- **Single Task Predictions**: Support for predictions with one dependent variable and one set of circumstances.
- **Multi-y Predictions**: Perform predictions with multiple dependent variables and a single set of circumstances.
- **Multi-theta Predictions**: Perform predictions with one dependent variable and multiple sets of circumstances.
- **Relevance-Based Grid Predictions**: Generate optimal predictions by evaluating all thresholds and variable combinations.
- **Grid Singularity Predictions**: Analyze grid predictions to find the singular optimal solution.
- **MaxFit Predictions**: Find the best-fit model based on adjusted relevance.

## 🚀 Installation
