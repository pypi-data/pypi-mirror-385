  # This test is broken on FreeBSD when running split, but not when running on the controller (2.19 and earlier).
  # On the controller, 'foo-unarchive-777.txt' is extracted as 0755, and the test never verifies it should be 0777.
  # The unarchive module expects the permissions to be 0755 in this case, so does not report it as changed.
  # When split, it is extracted as 0777, which causes the test to fail because it is reported as changed.
  # This appears to be due to faulty logic in unarchive around the permissions expected on BSD.
