In a similar way to invoices, this module adds the possibility to include sections and notes in Bills of Materials.
It adds a new page in the BoM form view that includes both components and sections.

This module depends on the account module, since the widget section_and_note is defined in section_and_note_fields_backend.js within the account module.
