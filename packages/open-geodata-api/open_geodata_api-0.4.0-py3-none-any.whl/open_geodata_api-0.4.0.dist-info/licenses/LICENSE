2. Any changes to third-party API terms of service or licensing
3. Any costs, fees, or charges imposed by third-party API providers
4. Any data licensing restrictions imposed by third-party providers
5. Any service interruptions, data losses, or damages resulting from third-party services

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK: Users of this software acknowledge that they use 
third-party APIs at their own risk and are solely responsible for compliance

===============================================================================
USER RESPONSIBILITIES
===============================================================================

By using this software, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with all third-party API 
   terms of service and data licensing agreements

2. You will not hold the authors or contributors of this software liable for

===============================================================================
DATA LICENSING COMPLEXITY WARNING
===============================================================================

⚠️  CRITICAL NOTICE: Geospatial data licensing can be complex and varies 
significantly between datasets, even within the same API service.

Common licensing scenarios you may encounter:
- Public Domain (no restrictions)
- Creative Commons (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, etc. - require attribution)
- Commercial restrictions (research/non-commercial use only)
- Government/institutional use restrictions
- Temporal restrictions (embargo periods)
- Geographic restrictions (country-specific licensing)

ALWAYS CHECK INDIVIDUAL DATASET LICENSING before using data in your projects.
The APIs may provide licensing information in dataset metadata, but it is YOUR
responsibility to verify and comply with these requirements.

Failure to comply with data licensing terms may result in legal consequences
that are entirely your responsibility.

===============================================================================
COMMERCIAL USE WARNING
===============================================================================

If you plan to use this software or accessed data for commercial purposes:

1. Verify that your intended use complies with all third-party API terms
2. Check individual dataset licenses for commercial use restrictions
3. Consider whether you need commercial API agreements with providers
4. Ensure proper data attribution and licensing compliance in your products
5. Consult with legal counsel if uncertain about licensing requirements

===============================================================================
RECOMMENDED BEST PRACTICES
===============================================================================

1. Always review API terms of service before using any third-party service
2. Check individual dataset metadata for specific licensing requirements
3. Implement proper error handling for API availability issues
4. Cache data appropriately while respecting API terms and data licensing
5. Provide proper attribution for all data sources in your applications
6. Monitor API usage to avoid exceeding rate limits or quotas
7. Keep your API credentials secure and never commit them to version control
8. Regularly review third-party terms for updates or changes
