#### Description

Modular computer vision library developed by the [PCR-UPM](https://pcr-upm.github.io/) group for high-performance image processing tasks. 
Designed with research and engineering in mind, the framework provides reusable components for image preprocessing, and model evaluation. 
It is built on top of widely adopted libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Rasterio.

#### System Requirements

This package requires GDAL. It is recommended to install it using Conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
```
