Gaia Engine is a lightweight Python framework for creating interactive visual simulations, designed to be easy to learn and use. With a top-down perspective, animated 2D sprites, and a 3D terrain heightmap, it lets audiences explore dynamic systems in an environment inspired by real-time strategy video games. The project is still in development and not ready for release
