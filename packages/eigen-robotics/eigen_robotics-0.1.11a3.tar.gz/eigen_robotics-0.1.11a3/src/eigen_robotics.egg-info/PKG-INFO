## üß≠ Overview

**Eigen Robotics** is a **Python-first robotics framework** built to make **developing, training, and deploying robots** dramatically simpler and faster. It **unifies simulation and real-world operation** under a single, consistent codebase, removing the need to rebuild tasks across different simulators or hardware setups. With a **lightweight, modular architecture** and seamless **Python integration**, Eigen allows researchers and engineers to move from **idea to working robot** in a fraction of the time, enabling a workflow that feels as intuitive and flexible as **modern machine-learning frameworks like PyTorch**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ **Unified Codebase** ‚Äî Run the same task in PyBullet, MuJoCo, or on the real robot.
- üîå **Extensible Drivers** ‚Äî Integrate any robot or sensor through a simple interface.
- üß† **ML-Native Design** ‚Äî Plug directly into PyTorch, imitation learning, and RL pipelines.
- üß© **Plug-and-Play Architecture** ‚Äî Add robots, sensors, and simulators via YAML configs.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Cross-Platform** ‚Äî Works seamlessly on macOS and Ubuntu.
- üß∞ **CLI + GUI Tools** ‚Äî Launch graphs, monitor data, and visualize systems in real time.


---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Install from PyPI
```bash
pip install eigen-robotics
```

### Develop from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eigen-Robotics/Eigen-Robotics.git
cd Eigen-Robotics
uv sync --extra default
```
Supports Python 3.11+ on macOS and Ubuntu.

---

## üß™ Quick Example

### Python API
```python
import eigen

env = eigen.make("franka_pickplace", backend="pybullet")
env.reset()
env.step([0.1, -0.2, 0.3])
```

### CLI Workflow
```bash
eigen graph launch examples/franka_pickplace.yaml
```
