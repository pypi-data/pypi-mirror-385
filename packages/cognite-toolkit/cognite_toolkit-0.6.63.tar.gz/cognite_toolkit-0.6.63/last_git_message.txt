[CDF-25921] ðŸ—„ Create data plugin (#2102)

# Description

This PR adds the alpha flag `v07` which we will use to put all `v07`
features behind. This will make it easy to make the minor PR when the
time comes.

It also introduce a `data` app and puts `download/upload/purge` behind
it. I removed download and upload from the entry app as they are both
alpha, but purge cannot be removed until the actual release is done.
