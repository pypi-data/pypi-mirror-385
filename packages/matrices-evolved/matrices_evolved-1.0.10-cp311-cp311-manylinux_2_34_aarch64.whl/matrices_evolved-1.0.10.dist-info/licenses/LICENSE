4. Redistribution and Pass‑Through
Any redistribution of the Licensed Work or Modifications must be solely for Non‑Commercial Use and must include a complete, verbatim copy of this License, copyright notices, and any attribution notices provided by the Licensor.
The Licensee must not impose additional terms that conflict with or dilute the restrictions herein, and must not sublicense under different terms.
Any downstream recipient automatically becomes a “Licensee” under this License and must accept it prior to use or receipt.
5. Source Availability and Network Use
If the Licensed Work or Modifications are made available to third parties in object code or are used to provide functionality over a network to third parties (including via web services, APIs, or hosted interfaces), the complete corresponding source code for the provided functionality must be made available to those third parties at no charge under this same License.
“Corresponding source” means all source files and build scripts necessary to generate, install, and run the distributed or network‑accessible components, excluding general‑purpose tools and unmodified third‑party dependencies distributed under their own licenses.
6. Attribution, Notices, and NOTICE File
Copyright and license notices provided by the Licensor must be preserved in source distributions and, where technically feasible, in user‑visible notices for object/hosted deployments.
If a NOTICE file is provided, all redistributions in object or hosted form must include a readable copy of the NOTICE file with attribution text unmodified except for formatting.

6A. Non‑Affiliation, No‑Endorsement, and Trademarks
The Licensor is a private party and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or acting on behalf of any government, ministry, agency, military, intelligence, defense organization, or government‑controlled entity, and no Licensee may state or imply any sponsorship, approval, affiliation, or endorsement by the Licensor or any government.
No license to any trademark, trade name, or service mark of the Licensor is granted under this License, and such marks must not be used to endorse or promote derivative projects or services without prior written permission.

7. Third‑Party Software
The Licensed Work may include or interface with third‑party components that are licensed under their own terms, which govern such components, and nothing in this License grants rights to third‑party intellectual property.
8. Support, Issues, and Verification
Any voluntary support, issue triage, or feature requests (if offered) are available exclusively through the Licensor’s designated public issue tracker for this project; currently, the Support Channel is only the project’s GitHub Issues page at https://github.com/alessblaze/Matrices-Evolved/issues.
Issue submitters must provide their full legal name; anonymous or pseudonymous requests may be declined.
Requests submitted by or on behalf of Prohibited Parties, or attempts to route support through intermediaries, agents, or alternative channels, may be refused at the Licensor’s discretion.
Support is discretionary and not a contractual obligation.
9. Compliance Assurance
On reasonable written request, the Licensee must provide a short, good‑faith written attestation describing Non‑Commercial Use and confirming that neither the Licensee nor known downstream recipients are Prohibited Parties and that the Licensed Work is not used for Prohibited Purposes or government use.
The Licensor may decline or terminate distribution, updates, keys, or access to new versions upon credible evidence of non‑compliance.
10. Term and Termination
This License is effective upon first access to or use of the Licensed Work and continues unless terminated.
All rights under this License terminate automatically and without notice if any term is breached, including but not limited to any Commercial Use, any government use, use by or for Prohibited Parties, or use for Prohibited Purposes.
Upon termination, all use must cease, and all copies (including Modifications) must be destroyed or permanently deleted; sections that by their nature should survive (including 3–7 and 9–15) shall survive.
Any reinstatement is solely at the Licensor’s written discretion.
11. No Warranty

Licensees shall screen end users and destinations, refrain from dealings with sanctioned parties, and not export or divert the Licensed Work for WMD‑related end uses or users.

The Licensed Work is not designed to process regulated personal data unless expressly stated by the Licensor; the Licensee is solely responsible for compliance with applicable data‑protection laws in any deployment.
15. Injunctive Relief
Breach of Sections 3–6A constitutes irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be inadequate; the Licensor is entitled to seek immediate injunctive or equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.
16. Governing Law and Forum
This License is governed by the laws of India, without regard to conflicts of law principles, and courts located in India shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over all disputes arising out of or relating to this License.
17. Severability; No Waiver
If any provision is held unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder shall continue in effect, and failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver.
18. Assignment
The Licensee may not assign, delegate, or transfer this License, by operation of law or otherwise, without the Licensor’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment is void.
19. Entire Agreement; Changes
This License is the entire agreement concerning the Licensed Work and supersedes all prior understandings related to its subject matter, and the Licensor may publish updated versions for new releases; existing releases remain under the version accompanying that release unless the Licensor permits re‑licensing.
20. Compliance with Laws
Use of the Licensed Work must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to dual‑use technologies and end‑use restrictions.
21. Source Identification (SPDX)
To facilitate compliance tooling and SBOMs, redistributed sources should include an SPDX header identifying this License using a custom SPDX identifier, for example: “SPDX‑License‑Identifier: LicenseRef‑Aless‑SA‑NC‑NM‑NG‑1.0”.
