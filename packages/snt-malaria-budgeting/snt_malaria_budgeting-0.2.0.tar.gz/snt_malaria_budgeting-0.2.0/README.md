# SNT Malaria Budgeting

A Python library for calculating malaria intervention budgets across different countries and time periods.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install snt-malaria-budgeting
```

### Development Installation

For development, clone the repository and install with development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This installs the package in editable mode along with all development tools (pytest, ruff, mypy, etc.).

## Example usage

To fetch budgets for a given country and years:

```python
from snt_malaria_budgeting.core.budget_calculator import get_budget
from snt_malaria_budgeting.models import (
    DEFAULT_COST_ASSUMPTIONS,
    InterventionDetailModel,
)

start_year = 2025
end_year = 2027
interventions = [InterventionDetailModel(name="iptp", type="SP", places=[1])]
settings = DEFAULT_COST_ASSUMPTIONS

budgets = []

for year in range(start_year, end_year + 1):
    print(f"Fetching budget for year: {year}")
    budgets.append(
        get_budget(
            year=year,
            interventions_input=interventions,
            settings=settings,
            cost_df=cost_df, # refer to unit tests for an example
            population_df=population_df, # refer to unit tests for an example
            spatial_planning_unit="key",
            local_currency="EUR",
            cost_overrides=[], # optional
        )
    )

print(budgets)
```

## Development

### Running Tests

After installing with development dependencies, run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
pytest -v # verbose output
pytest --cov=snt_malaria_budgeting --cov-report=html # with coverage report

# specific test files or methods:
pytest tests/core/test_budget_calculator.py
pytest tests/core/test_budget_calculator.py::TestBudgetCalculator::test_iptp_quantification
```

## Acknowledgements

This library is a Python port of the [PATH Budget Generation Function](https://github.com/PATH-Global-Health/budget-generation-function) (R implementation).
