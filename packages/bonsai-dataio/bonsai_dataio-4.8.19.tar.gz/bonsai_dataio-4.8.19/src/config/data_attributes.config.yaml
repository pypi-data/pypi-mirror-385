# REVISION OF CHEMICAL PRODUCTION
#
# a way to estimate the production of chemicals is via the input of heat (as combusted fuels)
# reported in IEA.
# in order to determine the supply, two parameters are inserted:
#    1. heat_coeff: LCI coeff on the use of heat per unit of supplied chemicals;
#                          --> estimated_value: input of heat/heat_coeff.
#
#    2. allowed_distance: the production estimated via heat_coeff is divided by this factor:
#                          --> replacing_value: estimated_value/allowed_distance.
#
# a value is replaced if old_value < estimated_value/allowed_distance
chem_dist: 2  # allowed_distance, arbitrary
heat_chem: 0.008  # heat_coeff, source: from value seen in DE - to be improved
