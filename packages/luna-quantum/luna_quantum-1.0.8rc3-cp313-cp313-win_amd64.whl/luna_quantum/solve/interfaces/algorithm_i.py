        ----------
        model: Optimization
            An instance of the `Optimization` class representing the problem
            to be solved, including any constraints or objectives.
        name: Optional[str]
            If provided, the name of the job. Defaults to None.
        backend: Optional[BACKEND_TYPE]
            If provided, the backend to use for the solver. If no backend is provided,
            the default backend for the solver will be used.

        Returns
        -------
        SolveJob
            A `SolveJob` object representing the results of the solve_job process,
            including the solve_job state and related metadata.
