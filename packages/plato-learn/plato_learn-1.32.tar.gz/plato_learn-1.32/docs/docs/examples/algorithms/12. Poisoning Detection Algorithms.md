### AsyncFilter

AsyncFilter is proposed to defend against untargeted poisoning attacks in asynchronous federated learning with a server filter. With statistical analysis, AsyncFilter identifies potential poisoned model updates and filters them out before the server aggregation stage.

```bash
cd examples/detector
uv run detector.py -c asyncfilter_fashion_6.yml
```
