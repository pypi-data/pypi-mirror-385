Changelog
=========

0.11.0 (2025-10-20)
===================

* Support specifying ``deprecated`` as a string by displaying the string as part of the
  generated YAML example documentation

0.10.0 (2025-10-09)
===================

* Make sure ``ConfigModel`` fields that have ``deprecated=True`` are marked as deprecated
  in generated YAML example documentation

0.9.0 (2025-09-03)
==================

* [#78] Added ``value_from`` construct for dynamic environment variable substitution
  in YAML configuration. Supports optional defaults and graceful fallback to model
  defaults when environment variables are missing.

0.8.2 (2025-06-04)
==================

* [#76] The bundled configuration for the Sites framework no longer suppresses database
  level validation errors, which now bubble up and get properly reported by the
  management command. This helps decipher validation errors arising from constraints
  that couldn't be captured at the configuration model level.

0.8.1 (2025-05-12)
==================

**Bugfixes**

* [#71] The fix for incorrect annotations for the default value in blank fields,
  introduced in 0.8.0, was not properly fixed for unmapped Django field types. This
  release addresses the issue so that the default type is properly accounted for also
  for unmapped field types.

0.8.0 (2025-05-08)
==================

**Bugfixes**

* [#68] Fix an issue whereby the annotation for Django fields would be incorrectly
  generated and raise an exception when ``blank=True`` and ``default=bool|None``.
  Defaults will now always be validated according to the field's base annotation, which
  will be expanded if necessary to accommodate the default.

0.7.2 (2025-03-24)
==================

**Maintenance**

* [#open-zaak/open-zaak#1856] Allow Django 5 as a dependency.

0.5.0 (2024-12-13)
==================

* Fixed an issue (#27) whereby empty strings would not be part of the string literal
  inferred from a string-based field's ``options`` when using a Django field ref.
* Added a generic configuration step for the Django sites module.
* Slug fields are now explicitly validated in Django field refs.

0.4.0 (2024-11-28)
==================

💥 **NOTE**: This release contains a number of significantly breaking changes. 💥

* The core API of the configuration steps has been changed to rely on Pydantic-based
  configuration models, and to rely solely on an ``execute`` hook, with ``is_configured``
  and ``test_results`` being deprecated. Details of the new API can be found in the
  README.
* The ``generate_config_docs`` command has been disabled until it can amended to work
  with the new API, which is planned for an upcoming release.

0.3.0 (2024-07-15)
==================

* added option ``--dry-run`` for ``generate_config_docs`` management command to check that docs are
  up-to-date without creating them.

0.2.0 (2024-07-11)
==================

* ``generate_config_docs`` management command added to autogenerate documentation based on configurationsteps

0.1.0 (2024-03-21)
==================

First release. Features:

* ``setup_configuration`` management command
* ``BaseConfigurationStep`` base class.
