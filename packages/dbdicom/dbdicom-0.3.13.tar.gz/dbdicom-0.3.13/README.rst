A python interface for reading and writing DICOM databases
----------------------------------------------------------

- **Documentation:** https://openmiblab.github.io/dbdicom/
- **Source code:** https://github.com/openmiblab/dbdicom


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

    pip install dbdicom


Aim
---

Simplify import and export of medical imaging data in DICOM format, 
increase the transparancy of post-processing pipelines for medical 
imaging biomarkers and improving standardization by avoiding the 
need for multiple data formats.

Status
------

`dbdicom` version 0.2 (lates 0.2.6) is stable and has been rolled 
out in image processing pipelines of ongoing studies 
`iBEAt <https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01901-x>`_
and
`AFiRM <ttps://www.uhdb.nhs.uk/afirm-study/>`_,
but is no longer supported and will be phased out.

Version 0.3 is a major rewrite based on these experiences aiming to 
simplify the code base and the API, and improve efficiency and 
coverage of DICOM SOP classes. Version 0.3 is currently *work in 
progress* and changes are not backwards compatible with version 0.2.

The API reference shows version 0.3 functionality but the user guide 
is for version 0.2. Updates are expected shortly.
