# Long-Range Dependence Estimators: A Comprehensive Survey of Classical, Machine Learning, and Neural Network Approaches

## Abstract

Long-range dependence (LRD) in time series, characterized by the Hurst exponent, represents a fundamental property across diverse fields including hydrology, finance, neuroscience, and geophysics. This comprehensive survey examines the evolution from classical statistical methods to modern machine learning and neural network approaches for Hurst exponent estimation. We provide detailed mathematical formulations, statistical properties, and comparative analysis of temporal domain methods (Rescaled Range Analysis, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Higuchi Method), spectral domain techniques (wavelet-based methods, periodogram approaches, Local Whittle estimation), multifractal extensions (MFDFA, Generalized Hurst Exponent), machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees), and neural network architectures (CNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer). Our analysis reveals that while classical methods provide theoretical foundations and interpretability, modern deep learning approaches offer superior accuracy and robustness, particularly for noisy and short time series. The survey concludes with practical guidelines for method selection and identifies emerging trends in the field.

## 1. Introduction

The Hurst exponent, introduced by Harold Edwin Hurst in 1951, serves as a fundamental measure of long-range dependence (LRD) and self-similarity in time series data. Originally developed for optimizing dam sizing on the Nile River, the concept has found widespread application across numerous disciplines, from financial market analysis to biomedical signal processing. The parameter H quantifies the relative tendency of a time series to exhibit persistence (H > 0.5), anti-persistence (H < 0.5), or short-range dependence (H = 0.5).

Mathematically, for a time series X(t), the Hurst exponent relates to the scaling behavior of the variance:

$$\text{Var}(X(t+τ) - X(t)) \sim τ^{2H} \text{ as } τ \to \infty$$

This fundamental relationship has driven the development of numerous estimation techniques, each with distinct advantages and limitations. The evolution of computational capabilities has enabled the transition from classical statistical approaches to sophisticated machine learning and neural network methods.

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of Hurst exponent estimation techniques, organized into three main categories: classical methods, machine learning approaches, and neural network architectures. For each method, we present detailed mathematical formulations, statistical properties, computational complexity, and practical considerations.

## 2. Classical Methods

### 2.1 Temporal Domain Methods

#### 2.1.1 Rescaled Range (R/S) Analysis

The Rescaled Range (R/S) analysis represents the foundational method for Hurst exponent estimation, directly implementing Hurst's original approach.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Given a time series {X_t}_{t=1}^n, the R/S statistic for a subseries of length τ is defined as:

$$R/S(τ) = \frac{1}{S(τ)} \left[ \max_{1 \leq k \leq τ} \sum_{i=1}^k (X_i - \bar{X}_τ) - \min_{1 \leq k \leq τ} \sum_{i=1}^k (X_i - \bar{X}_τ) \right]$$

where:
- $\bar{X}_τ = \frac{1}{τ} \sum_{i=1}^τ X_i$ is the sample mean
- $S(τ) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{τ} \sum_{i=1}^τ (X_i - \bar{X}_τ)^2}$ is the sample standard deviation

The Hurst exponent is estimated from the scaling relationship:

$$E[R/S(τ)] \sim cτ^H$$

where the exponent H is obtained through log-log regression: $\log(R/S(τ)) \sim H \log(τ) + \log(c)$.

**Statistical Properties:**
- Asymptotic distribution: For large τ, $R/S(τ)$ follows a distribution related to the Brownian bridge
- Bias: Systematic overestimation for H < 0.72 and underestimation for H > 0.72
- Variance: High variance, particularly for short time series
- Sample size requirements: Typically requires n > 2000 for 5% accuracy

**Computational Complexity:** O(n²) for complete analysis across all subseries lengths.

#### 2.1.2 Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)

DFA addresses the limitations of R/S analysis by incorporating explicit detrending, making it robust to non-stationarities.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

1. **Integration:** Convert the time series to a profile:
   $$Y(k) = \sum_{i=1}^k [X_i - \bar{X}]$$

2. **Segmentation:** Divide Y(k) into non-overlapping segments of length s.

3. **Local detrending:** For each segment ν, fit a polynomial $P_ν(k)$ of order m and calculate:
   $$F²(ν,s) = \frac{1}{s} \sum_{k=1}^s [Y((ν-1)s + k) - P_ν(k)]²$$

4. **Fluctuation function:** Compute the average fluctuation:
   $$F(s) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_s} \sum_{ν=1}^{N_s} F²(ν,s)}$$

   where $N_s = \lfloor n/s \rfloor$ is the number of segments.

5. **Scaling:** The Hurst exponent is obtained from:
   $$F(s) \sim s^H$$

**Extensions:**
- **DFA-m:** Uses polynomial detrending of order m (DFA-1: linear, DFA-2: quadratic)
- **Bidirectional DFA:** Processes both forward and backward directions to handle edge effects

**Statistical Properties:**
- Consistency: Proven consistent for stationary processes with 0 < H < 1
- Robustness: Less sensitive to trends compared to R/S analysis
- Finite-size effects: Systematic bias for small segment sizes
- Optimal range: Typically 10 ≤ s ≤ n/4 for reliable estimation

**Computational Complexity:** O(n log n) with efficient implementation.

#### 2.1.3 Higuchi Method

The Higuchi method estimates the Hurst exponent through fractal dimension analysis, exploiting the relationship D + H = 2.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

1. **Curve construction:** For time lag k and starting point m, construct:
   $$X_m^{(k)} = \{X_m, X_{m+k}, X_{m+2k}, ..., X_{m+\lfloor(n-m)/k\rfloor k}\}$$

2. **Length calculation:** Compute the curve length:
   $$L_m(k) = \frac{1}{k} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor(n-m)/k\rfloor} |X_{m+ik} - X_{m+(i-1)k}| \right] \cdot \frac{n-1}{\lfloor(n-m)/k\rfloor k}$$

3. **Average length:** Calculate the mean length over all starting points:
   $$L(k) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{m=1}^k L_m(k)$$

4. **Scaling:** The fractal dimension D is obtained from:
   $$L(k) \sim k^{-D}$$

5. **Hurst exponent:** $H = 2 - D$

**Statistical Properties:**
- Efficiency: Computationally efficient, suitable for real-time applications
- Bias: Tendency to overestimate H, particularly for short series
- Noise sensitivity: Performance degrades with increasing noise levels
- Sample size: Effective with relatively small datasets (n > 100)

**Computational Complexity:** O(n log n)

### 2.2 Spectral Domain Methods

#### 2.2.1 Wavelet-Based Methods

Wavelet-based estimators leverage the multi-resolution properties of wavelet transforms to analyze scaling behavior across different time scales.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

For a mother wavelet ψ with vanishing moments, the continuous wavelet transform is:

$$W(a,b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(t) \psi\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right) dt$$

**Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) Approach:**

1. **Decomposition:** Compute wavelet coefficients at scale j:
   $$d_{j,k} = \sum_{t} X_t \psi_{j,k}(t)$$

2. **Variance estimation:** Calculate the sample variance at each scale:
   $$\hat{\mu}_j² = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} d_{j,k}²$$

3. **Scaling relationship:** The Hurst exponent follows:
   $$E[\hat{\mu}_j²] \sim 2^{j(2H+1)}$$

4. **Log-linear regression:** Estimate H from:
   $$\log_2(\hat{\mu}_j²) \sim (2H+1)j + \text{constant}$$

**Wavelet Variance Estimator (VVL):**

$$\hat{H}_{VVL} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j \log_2(\hat{\mu}_j²) - \frac{1}{J} \sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j \sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} \log_2(\hat{\mu}_j²)}{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j² - \frac{1}{J} \left(\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j\right)²} - 1 \right]$$

where J = j₂ - j₁ + 1 is the number of scales used.

**Statistical Properties:**
- Robustness: Automatic elimination of polynomial trends up to the wavelet's vanishing moment order
- Multi-resolution: Simultaneous analysis across multiple scales
- Edge effects: Potential artifacts at series boundaries
- Wavelet choice: Daubechies wavelets commonly used; minimal impact on H estimation

**Computational Complexity:** O(n) using fast wavelet transform algorithms.

#### 2.2.2 Periodogram Methods

Periodogram-based methods exploit the theoretical relationship between the power spectral density and the Hurst exponent.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

For a long-range dependent process, the spectral density near zero frequency follows:

$$f(λ) \sim C|λ|^{1-2H} \text{ as } λ \to 0^+$$

**Standard Periodogram:**

1. **Periodogram computation:**
   $$I(λ_j) = \frac{1}{2πn} \left| \sum_{t=1}^n X_t e^{-iλ_j t} \right|²$$

   where $λ_j = 2πj/n$ are the Fourier frequencies.

2. **Log-periodogram regression:**
   $$\log I(λ_j) \sim \log C + (1-2H) \log λ_j + \epsilon_j$$

**Modified Periodogram (Reeves):**

Uses a refined approximation of the spectral density:

$$\log I(λ_j) \sim \log C + (1-2H) \log \left| 2\sin\left(\frac{λ_j}{2}\right) \right| + \epsilon_j$$

**Statistical Properties:**
- Theoretical foundation: Well-established asymptotic theory
- Bandwidth selection: Critical parameter affecting bias-variance tradeoff
- Frequency range: Typically uses low frequencies j = 1, ..., m where m = O(n^δ) with 0 < δ < 1
- Consistency: Consistent under regularity conditions

**Computational Complexity:** O(n log n) using FFT.

#### 2.2.3 Local Whittle Estimation

The Local Whittle estimator provides a maximum likelihood approach in the frequency domain with strong theoretical properties.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

**Objective Function:**

$$Q_m(G,d) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \left[ \log(Gλ_j^{-2d}) + \frac{λ_j^{2d}}{G} I(λ_j) \right]$$

where:
- m is the number of low frequencies used
- d = H - 1/2 is the long-memory parameter
- G is a scale parameter

**Estimation:**

Minimizing with respect to G yields:

$$\hat{G}(d) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m λ_j^{2d} I(λ_j)$$

The Local Whittle estimator is:

$$\hat{d} = \arg\min_{d \in [Δ₁,Δ₂]} R(d)$$

where:

$$R(d) = \log \hat{G}(d) - \frac{2d}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \log λ_j$$

**Statistical Properties:**
- Consistency: Consistent for d ∈ (-1/2, 1/2) under regularity conditions
- Asymptotic normality: $\sqrt{m}(\hat{d} - d_0) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, 1/4)$
- Efficiency: Achieves optimal convergence rate

**Computational Complexity:** O(n log n + m²) where typically m << n.

### 2.3 Multifractal Methods

MFDFA extends DFA to capture the multifractal properties of time series by analyzing different statistical moments.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Following the DFA procedure up to computing F²(ν,s), MFDFA calculates:

1. **q-order fluctuation function:**
   $$F_q(s) = \left\{ \frac{1}{N_s} \sum_{ν=1}^{N_s} [F²(ν,s)]^{q/2} \right\}^{1/q}$$

   For q = 0: $F_0(s) = \exp\left\{ \frac{1}{2N_s} \sum_{ν=1}^{N_s} \ln[F²(ν,s)] \right\}$

2. **Generalized Hurst exponent:**
   $$F_q(s) \sim s^{h(q)}$$

   where h(q) is the generalized Hurst exponent.

3. **Multifractal spectrum:**
   $$τ(q) = qh(q) - 1$$

   $$f(α) = q(α)α - τ(q(α))$$

   where α is the Hölder exponent and f(α) is the multifractal spectrum.

**Statistical Properties:**
- Multifractal characterization: Captures higher-order statistical properties
- Moment orders: Typically q ∈ [-5, 5] to avoid numerical instabilities
- Spectrum width: Δα = α_max - α_min indicates multifractal strength
- Computational intensity: Significantly more computationally demanding than DFA

**Computational Complexity:** O(qn log n) where q is the number of moment orders.

#### 2.3.2 Generalized Hurst Exponent (GHE)

The GHE method analyzes the scaling behavior of different moments directly from the time series.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

1. **Increments:** Compute increments at scale τ:
   $$ΔX_τ(i) = X(i+τ) - X(i)$$

2. **q-th moment:** Calculate:
   $$M_q(τ) = \left\langle |ΔX_τ(i)|^q \right\rangle^{1/q}$$

3. **Scaling:** The generalized Hurst exponent is obtained from:
   $$M_q(τ) \sim τ^{H(q)}$$

**Ensemble Prediction:**

$$\hat{H}_{RF}(x) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B T_b(x)$$

**Tree Construction:** Each tree uses:

### 3.3 Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT)

GBT builds an ensemble of weak learners sequentially, where each new model corrects errors made by previous models.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

**Sequential Learning:** At iteration m, fit a new tree T_m to residuals:

$$r_{i,m} = H_i - F_{m-1}(x_i)$$

where $F_{m-1}$ is the ensemble after m-1 iterations.

**Gradient Descent in Function Space:**

$$F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + η \cdot T_m(x)$$

where η is the learning rate.

## 10. Conclusion

The field of Hurst exponent estimation has evolved dramatically from Hurst's original rescaled range analysis to sophisticated neural network architectures. This survey has presented a comprehensive overview of methods spanning classical statistical approaches, machine learning algorithms, and deep neural networks.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Classical methods** remain valuable for their interpretability and theoretical foundations, with DFA emerging as the most versatile approach
2. **Machine learning methods** offer excellent performance with proper feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning
3. **Neural network approaches** achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly for complex, noisy, or short time series
4. **Ensemble methods** combining multiple approaches often yield the best performance
5. **Method selection** should be driven by data characteristics, computational constraints, and application requirements

**Future Outlook:**

The integration of classical statistical insights with modern computational methods shows great promise. Hybrid approaches that combine the interpretability of classical methods with the power of deep learning represent a particularly exciting direction. Additionally, the development of specialized architectures for time series analysis, uncertainty quantification methods, and automated model selection frameworks will further advance the field.

**Recommendations:**

For practitioners, we recommend:
- Starting with DFA as a reliable baseline
- Exploring neural network approaches for challenging datasets
- Using ensemble methods for critical applications
- Considering computational constraints in method selection
- Validating results across multiple methods when possible

The choice of method should ultimately depend on the specific characteristics of the data, the required accuracy, computational resources, and the need for interpretability in the particular application domain.
