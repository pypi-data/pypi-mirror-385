## 1. Introduction

The characterization of long-range dependence (LRD) in time series through the Hurst exponent H has become fundamental across numerous scientific disciplines. While classical methods such as rescaled range analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis provide valuable approaches to LRD estimation, wavelet-based methods offer unique advantages through their natural multi-scale decomposition capabilities and theoretical robustness properties.

Wavelet analysis provides a natural framework for studying scale-dependent phenomena, making it particularly well-suited for analyzing the power-law scaling behaviors that characterize long-range dependent processes. The ability of wavelets to simultaneously localize information in both time and frequency domains, combined with their vanishing moment properties, enables effective separation of long-range correlations from local trends and artifacts.

This comprehensive survey examines the mathematical foundations of wavelet-based LRD estimators, from the pioneering Abry-Veitch method to modern robust approaches using non-decimated transforms and trimean estimators. We provide detailed mathematical formulations, statistical properties, and practical considerations for each method, serving both theoretical researchers and practitioners applying these techniques to real data.

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundations

Long-range dependence manifests in the slow power-law decay of the autocorrelation function:

$$r(\tau) = \text{Cov}(X_t, X_{t+\tau}) \sim C\tau^{-(2-2H)} \text{ as } \tau \to \infty$$

where $0 < H < 1$ is the Hurst exponent. Equivalently, in the spectral domain:

$$S(f) \sim C_f |f|^{-(2H-1)} \text{ as } f \to 0^+$$

These scaling relationships form the theoretical basis for wavelet-based estimation approaches, which exploit the natural scale-analysis capabilities of wavelet transforms to extract the Hurst parameter from the scaling behavior of wavelet coefficients.

## 2. Multiresolution Analysis and Wavelet Transforms

### 2.1 Mathematical Framework

A multiresolution analysis (MRA) consists of a collection of nested subspaces $\{V_j\}_{j \in \mathbb{Z}}$ satisfying:

1. $V_j \subset V_{j+1}$ for all $j \in \mathbb{Z}$
2. $\overline{\bigcup_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} V_j} = L^2(\mathbb{R})$
3. $\bigcap_{j=-\infty}^{\infty} V_j = \{0\}$
4. $f(x) \in V_j \Leftrightarrow f(2x) \in V_{j+1}$

The scaling function $\phi(x)$ and mother wavelet $\psi(x)$ generate orthonormal bases for the approximation and detail subspaces respectively:

$$\phi_{j,k}(x) = 2^{j/2}\phi(2^j x - k)$$
$$\psi_{j,k}(x) = 2^{j/2}\psi(2^j x - k)$$

### 2.2 Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

The discrete wavelet transform decomposes a signal $X(t)$ into approximation and detail coefficients:

$$s_{j,k} = \langle X, \phi_{j,k} \rangle = \int X(t)\phi_{j,k}(t)dt$$
$$d_{j,k} = \langle X, \psi_{j,k} \rangle = \int X(t)\psi_{j,k}(t)dt$$

The fast DWT algorithm implements this decomposition through a cascade of high-pass and low-pass filters followed by downsampling, with computational complexity $O(N)$ for a signal of length $N$.

### 2.3 Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)

The continuous wavelet transform provides a more flexible analysis framework:

$$W(a,b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(t) \psi^*\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right) dt$$

where $a > 0$ is the scale parameter, $b \in \mathbb{R}$ is the translation parameter, and $\psi^*$ denotes the complex conjugate of the analyzing wavelet.

### 2.4 Non-Decimated Wavelet Transform (NDWT)

The non-decimated wavelet transform eliminates the downsampling step, producing a redundant but translation-invariant representation:

$$d_{j,k}^{(nd)} = \sum_{n} X_n h_j[k-n]$$

where $h_j$ are the upsampled wavelet filters. The NDWT generates $N \times (J+1)$ coefficients for a signal of length $N$ with $J$ decomposition levels, providing improved statistical properties for parameter estimation.

## 3. Classical Wavelet-Based Estimators

### 3.1 The Abry-Veitch Estimator

The Abry-Veitch (AV) method represents the foundational approach to wavelet-based Hurst estimation, introduced in 1998.

#### 3.1.1 Mathematical Formulation

**Step 1: Wavelet Coefficient Variance Estimation**

At each decomposition level $j$, compute the sample variance of wavelet coefficients:

$$\hat{\mu}_j^2 = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} d_{j,k}^2$$

where $n_j$ is the number of available coefficients at level $j$ (typically $n_j \approx N/2^j$ for an $N$-point signal).

**Step 2: Theoretical Scaling Relationship**

For a long-range dependent process with Hurst parameter $H$, the expected variance follows:

$$\mathbb{E}[\hat{\mu}_j^2] = \sigma^2 2^{j(2H+1)} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\hat{\psi}(2^j \omega)|^2 |\omega|^{1-2H} d\omega$$

where $\hat{\psi}(\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the analyzing wavelet.

**Step 3: Bias Correction**

The integral in the scaling relationship can be simplified using the vanishing moment property. For a wavelet with $N_0$ vanishing moments, if $N_0 > H - 1/2$:

$$\mathbb{E}[\hat{\mu}_j^2] \approx C 2^{j(2H+1)}$$

where $C$ is a constant independent of scale $j$.

**Step 4: Linear Regression**

Taking logarithms yields the linear relationship:

$$\log_2(\hat{\mu}_j^2) = \log_2(C) + j(2H+1) + \epsilon_j$$

The Hurst exponent is estimated via weighted least squares:

$$\hat{H}_{AV} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j j \log_2(\hat{\mu}_j^2) - \frac{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j j \sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j \log_2(\hat{\mu}_j^2)}{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j}}{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j j^2 - \frac{(\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j j)^2}{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j}} - \frac{1}{2}\right]$$

where the weights $w_j$ are chosen as the inverse of the theoretical asymptotic variance of $\log_2(\hat{\mu}_j^2)$.

#### 3.1.2 Statistical Properties

**Bias Properties:**
- Asymptotically unbiased under general conditions
- Finite sample bias depends on the choice of scale range $[j_1, j_2]$
- Vanishing moment requirement: $N_0 > H - 1/2$ ensures convergence

**Variance and Efficiency:**
The asymptotic variance of the AV estimator is:

$$\text{Var}(\hat{H}_{AV}) = \frac{1}{4 \ln^2(2)} \left[\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j (j - \bar{j})^2\right]^{-1}$$

where $\bar{j} = \frac{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j j}{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} w_j}$.

**Confidence Intervals:**
Under Gaussian assumptions, confidence intervals are given by:

$$\hat{H}_{AV} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\text{Var}(\hat{H}_{AV})}$$

where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the $(1-\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.

#### 3.1.3 Robustness to Trends

A key advantage of the AV estimator is its robustness to polynomial trends. For a signal $Y(t) = X(t) + p(t)$ where $p(t)$ is a polynomial of degree $m < N_0$:

$$d_{j,k}^{(Y)} = d_{j,k}^{(X)} + d_{j,k}^{(p)}$$

Since wavelets with $N_0$ vanishing moments satisfy $\int t^m \psi(t) dt = 0$ for $m < N_0$, we have $d_{j,k}^{(p)} = 0$, ensuring that polynomial trends do not affect the estimation.

### 3.2 Soltani-Simard-Boichu (SSB) Method

The SSB method introduces a mid-energy approach to improve the statistical properties of wavelet-based estimation.

#### 3.2.1 Mathematical Formulation

**Step 1: Mid-Energy Definition**

Instead of using individual squared coefficients, the SSB method computes mid-energies:

$$D_{j,k} = \frac{d_{j,k}^2 + d_{j,k+n_j/2}^2}{2}$$

for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n_j/2$, assuming $n_j$ is even.

**Step 2: Logarithmic Transform and Averaging**

Compute the level-wise average of logarithmic mid-energies:

$$\hat{\mu}_{j}^{(SSB)} = \frac{1}{n_j/2} \sum_{k=1}^{n_j/2} \log(D_{j,k})$$

**Step 3: Theoretical Foundation**

Under the assumption that $d_{j,k}$ and $d_{j,k+n_j/2}$ are independent Gaussian variables with variance $\sigma_j^2 = \sigma^2 2^{-j(2H+1)}$, the mid-energy $D_{j,k}$ follows an exponential distribution:

$$D_{j,k} \sim \text{Exp}(\sigma_j^2)$$

with density $f(x) = \sigma_j^{-2} \exp(-x/\sigma_j^2)$.

**Step 4: Expected Value Calculation**

The expected value of the logarithmic mid-energy is:

$$\mathbb{E}[\log(D_{j,k})] = \log(\sigma_j^2) + \gamma$$

where $\gamma \approx 0.5772$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

**Step 5: Linear Regression**

This leads to the linear relationship:

$$\hat{\mu}_{j}^{(SSB)} = \log(\sigma^2) + \gamma - j(2H+1)\log(2) + \epsilon_j$$

The Hurst exponent is estimated as:

$$\hat{H}_{SSB} = -\frac{1}{2\log(2)}\hat{\beta} - \frac{1}{2}$$

where $\hat{\beta}$ is the slope from regressing $\hat{\mu}_{j}^{(SSB)}$ on $j$.

#### 3.2.2 Statistical Properties

**Asymptotic Normality:**
The SSB estimator is asymptotically normal with:

$$\sqrt{n}(\hat{H}_{SSB} - H) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, \sigma_{SSB}^2)$$

where the asymptotic variance $\sigma_{SSB}^2$ depends on the number of levels used in regression.

**Bias Characteristics:**
- Lower bias compared to direct variance methods
- Reduced sensitivity to boundary effects
- Improved performance for short time series

### 3.3 Variance-Versus-Level (VVL) Method

The VVL method provides a direct wavelet-based implementation focusing on the variance scaling across decomposition levels.

#### 3.3.1 Mathematical Formulation

**Step 1: Level-wise Variance Computation**

$$\hat{\sigma}_j^2 = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{k=1}^{n_j} d_{j,k}^2$$

**Step 2: Scaling Relationship**

For fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$:

$$\mathbb{E}[\hat{\sigma}_j^2] = C \cdot 2^{j(2H+1)}$$

**Step 3: Log-Log Regression**

$$\log_2(\hat{\sigma}_j^2) = \log_2(C) + j(2H+1)$$

The Hurst exponent estimate is:

$$\hat{H}_{VVL} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j \log_2(\hat{\sigma}_j^2) - \frac{1}{J} \sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j \sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} \log_2(\hat{\sigma}_j^2)}{\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j^2 - \frac{1}{J}(\sum_{j=j_1}^{j_2} j)^2} - 1\right)$$

where $J = j_2 - j_1 + 1$ is the number of scales used.

#### 3.3.2 Wavelet Selection Considerations

**Daubechies Wavelets:**
For Hurst estimation, Daubechies wavelets are commonly chosen due to:
- Compact support (finite time support)
- Controllable number of vanishing moments
- Orthogonality properties
- Efficient implementation

The number of vanishing moments $N_0$ should satisfy $N_0 \geq \max(1, \lceil H + 1/2 \rceil)$ to ensure unbiased estimation.

**Performance Comparison:**
Empirical studies show that Daubechies-2 (Haar) and Daubechies-4 wavelets often provide optimal performance for Hurst estimation, balancing bias reduction with variance minimization.

## 4. Non-Decimated Wavelet Transform Methods

### 4.1 Theoretical Advantages of NDWT

The non-decimated wavelet transform offers several advantages for Hurst estimation:

1. **Translation Invariance:** Eliminates dependency on signal alignment
2. **Redundancy:** Increased coefficient availability improves statistical properties
3. **Arbitrary Signal Length:** No power-of-2 length requirement
4. **Reduced Boundary Effects:** Better handling of finite-length signals

### 4.2 NDWT Mathematical Framework

In a $J$-level NDWT decomposition of a signal of length $N$, the transform produces $N \times (J+1)$ coefficients, with $N$ coefficients at each level $j$.

**Filter Implementation:**
$$d_{j,k}^{(nd)} = \sum_{n=0}^{L-1} h_j[n] X_{(k-n) \bmod N}$$

where $h_j[n]$ are the upsampled wavelet filters:
$$h_j[n] = h[n] \text{ if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2^j}, \text{ and } 0 \text{ otherwise}$$

### 4.3 Mid-Energy Approach with NDWT

Following the SSB framework, mid-energies are computed as:

$$D_{j,k} = \frac{(d_{j,k}^{(nd)})^2 + (d_{j,k+N/2}^{(nd)})^2}{2}$$

for $k = 1, 2, \ldots, N/2$.

**Independence Assumption:**
While $d_{j,k}^{(nd)}$ and $d_{j,k+N/2}^{(nd)}$ are not truly independent due to the redundancy of NDWT, their correlation is sufficiently weak for large $N$ to justify the exponential distribution assumption for $D_{j,k}$.

## 5. Robust Trimean-Based Estimators

### 5.1 General Trimean Estimator Theory

The general trimean estimator addresses the non-smooth behavior of the median while maintaining robustness against outliers.

#### 5.1.1 Mathematical Definition

For a random sample $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ with sample quantiles $Y_p$, the general trimean estimator is:

$$\hat{\mu}_{trimean} = \frac{\alpha}{2} Y_p + (1-\alpha) Y_{1/2} + \frac{\alpha}{2} Y_{1-p}$$

where $p \in (0, 1/2)$ and $\alpha \in [0, 1]$.

#### 5.1.2 Asymptotic Distribution

The asymptotic distribution of sample quantiles provides the foundation for trimean estimator theory:

$$\sqrt{n}((Y_{p_1}, Y_{p_2}, \ldots, Y_{p_r}) - (\xi_{p_1}, \xi_{p_2}, \ldots, \xi_{p_r})) \xrightarrow{d} MVN(0, \Sigma)$$

where $\Sigma = (\sigma_{ij})_{r \times r}$ with:

$$\sigma_{ij} = \frac{p_i(1-p_j)}{f(\xi_{p_i})f(\xi_{p_j})} \text{ for } i \leq j$$

**General Trimean Distribution:**
$$\hat{\mu}_{trimean} \sim N(E[\hat{\mu}_{trimean}], \text{Var}(\hat{\mu}_{trimean}))$$

with:
- $E[\hat{\mu}_{trimean}] = A \cdot \xi$ where $A = [\alpha/2, 1-\alpha, \alpha/2]$
- $\text{Var}(\hat{\mu}_{trimean}) = \frac{1}{n} A \Sigma A^T$

### 5.2 Tukey's Trimean Estimator

**Parameters:** $\alpha = 1/2$, $p = 1/4$

**Formula:** 
$$\hat{\mu}_T = \frac{1}{4}Y_{1/4} + \frac{1}{2}Y_{1/2} + \frac{1}{4}Y_{3/4}$$

**Asymptotic Properties:**
$$\hat{\mu}_T \sim N\left(A_T \cdot \xi_T, \frac{1}{n} A_T \Sigma_T A_T^T\right)$$

where $A_T = [1/4, 1/2, 1/4]$ and $\xi_T = [\xi_{1/4}, \xi_{1/2}, \xi_{3/4}]^T$.

### 5.3 Gastwirth Estimator

**Parameters:** $\alpha = 0.6$, $p = 1/3$

**Formula:**
$$\hat{\mu}_G = 0.3 Y_{1/3} + 0.4 Y_{1/2} + 0.3 Y_{2/3}$$

**Asymptotic Properties:**
$$\hat{\mu}_G \sim N\left(A_G \cdot \xi_G, \frac{1}{n} A_G \Sigma_G A_G^T\right)$$

where $A_G = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]$ and $\xi_G = [\xi_{1/3}, \xi_{1/2}, \xi_{2/3}]^T$.

### 5.4 Application to Hurst Estimation

#### 5.4.1 General Trimean of Mid-Energy (GTME) Method

**Step 1: Grouping Strategy**
To address correlation in NDWT coefficients, divide the $N/2$ mid-energies at each level $j$ into $M$ groups by sampling every $M$-th point:

Group $i$: $\{D_{j,i}, D_{j,i+M}, D_{j,i+2M}, \ldots, D_{j,(N/2-M+i)}\}$

**Step 2: Trimean Application**
Apply the general trimean estimator $\hat{\mu}_{j,i}$ to each group $i$ at level $j$.

**Step 3: Theoretical Distribution**
For exponentially distributed mid-energies $D_{j,k} \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_j^{-1})$ with $\lambda_j = \sigma^2 \cdot 2^{-(2H+1)j}$:

$$\hat{\mu}_{j,i} \sim N\left(c(\alpha, p) \lambda_j, \frac{2M}{N} f(\alpha, p) \lambda_j^2\right)$$

where:
- $c(\alpha, p) = \frac{\alpha}{2} \log\left(\frac{1}{p(1-p)}\right) + (1-\alpha) \log 2$
- $f(\alpha, p) = \frac{\alpha(1-2p)(\alpha-4p)}{4p(1-p)} + 1$

**Step 4: Hurst Estimation**
$$\hat{H}_{GTME} = -\frac{\bar{\beta}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}$$

where $\bar{\beta} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M \hat{\beta}_i$ and $\hat{\beta}_i$ are slopes from regressing $\log_2(\hat{\mu}_{j,i})$ on $j$.

**Step 5: Optimal Parameters**
Minimizing the asymptotic variance yields:
- $\hat{p} = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.3$
- $\hat{\alpha} = 2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 0.6$

These parameters closely match the Gastwirth estimator specifications.

#### 5.4.2 General Trimean of Logarithm of Mid-Energy (GTLME) Method

**Step 1: Logarithmic Transform**
Apply the general trimean estimator to logged mid-energies:
$$L_{j,k} = \log(D_{j,k})$$

**Step 2: Distribution of Logged Mid-Energies**
For $D_{j,k} \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_j^{-1})$, the logged values have:
- PDF: $f(y) = \lambda_j^{-1} e^{-\lambda_j^{-1} e^y} e^y$
- CDF: $F(y) = 1 - e^{-\lambda_j^{-1} e^y}$

**Step 3: Quantiles**
The $p$-quantile is: $\xi_p = \log(-\lambda_j \log(1-p))$

**Step 4: Asymptotic Distribution**
$$\hat{\mu}_{j,i} \sim N\left(c(\alpha, p) + \log(\lambda_j), \frac{2M}{N} f(\alpha, p)\right)$$

where:
- $c(\alpha, p) = \frac{\alpha}{2} \log\left(\log\frac{1}{1-p} \cdot \log\frac{1}{p}\right) + (1-\alpha) \log(\log 2)$
- $f(\alpha, p) = \frac{\alpha^2}{4g_1(p)} + \frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{2g_2(p)} + \frac{(1-\alpha)^2}{(\log 2)^2}$

**Step 5: Hurst Estimation**
$$\hat{H}_{GTLME} = -\frac{1}{2\log 2}\bar{\beta} - \frac{1}{2}$$

where $\bar{\beta}$ comes from regressing $\hat{\mu}_{j,i}$ on $j$.

**Step 6: Optimal Parameters**
Numerical optimization yields:
- $\hat{p} = 0.24$
- $\hat{\alpha} = 0.5965$

These parameters are close to Tukey's trimean but place slightly more weight on the median.

## 6. Multivariate Wavelet Estimators

### 6.1 Multivariate Fractional Brownian Motion

For multivariate fractional Brownian motion (mfBm) with Hurst parameter vector $\mathbf{H} = [H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_d]^T$, the covariance structure is:

$$\mathbb{E}[X_i(t)X_j(s)] = \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{2}(|t|^{H_i+H_j} + |s|^{H_i+H_j} - |t-s|^{H_i+H_j})$$

### 6.2 Eigenvalue Regression Method

**Step 1: Wavelet Decomposition**
Apply NDWT to each component of the multivariate signal, obtaining coefficient matrices $\mathbf{D}_j$ at each level $j$.

**Step 2: Covariance Matrix Estimation**
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_j = \frac{1}{n_j} \mathbf{D}_j \mathbf{D}_j^T$$

**Step 3: Eigenvalue Computation**
Compute eigenvalues $\{\hat{\lambda}_{j,k}\}_{k=1}^d$ of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_j$.

**Step 4: Scaling Relationship**
For mfBm, the eigenvalues scale as:
$$\mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{j,k}] \sim C_k \cdot 2^{j(2H_k+1)}$$

**Step 5: Individual Hurst Estimation**
$$\hat{H}_k = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial \log_2(\hat{\lambda}_{j,k})}{\partial j} - 1\right)$$

### 6.3 Statistical Properties

**Consistency:**
Under regularity conditions, the multivariate wavelet estimator is consistent:
$$\hat{\mathbf{H}} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbf{H}$$

**Asymptotic Normality:**
$$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\mathbf{H}} - \mathbf{H}) \xrightarrow{d} N(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_H)$$

where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_H$ depends on the cross-correlation structure of the multivariate process.

## 7. Continuous Wavelet Transform Approaches

### 7.1 CWT-Based Hurst Estimation

**Step 1: Continuous Wavelet Transform**
$$W(a,b) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(t) \psi^*\left(\frac{t-b}{a}\right) dt$$

**Step 2: Scale-Dependent Energy**
$$E(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |W(a,b)|^2 db$$

**Step 3: Scaling Relationship**
For fractional Brownian motion:
$$\mathbb{E}[E(a)] \sim C \cdot a^{2H+1}$$

**Step 4: Log-Log Regression**
$$\log E(a) = \log C + (2H+1) \log a + \epsilon$$

The CWT-based Hurst estimate is:
$$\hat{H}_{CWT} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial \log E(a)}{\partial \log a} - 1\right)$$

### 7.2 Wavelet Choice in CWT

**Morlet Wavelet:**
$$\psi(t) = e^{i\omega_0 t} e^{-t^2/2}$$

Commonly used with $\omega_0 = 6$ to satisfy the admissibility condition.

**Mexican Hat Wavelet:**
$$\psi(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}\pi^{1/4}} (1-t^2) e^{-t^2/2}$$

**Complex Morlet Wavelets:**
Provide both amplitude and phase information, useful for analyzing oscillatory components in LRD signals.

### 7.3 Computational Considerations

**FFT Implementation:**
The CWT can be efficiently computed using FFT:
$$W(a,b) = \sqrt{a} \cdot \text{IFFT}[\hat{X}(\omega) \hat{\psi}^*(a\omega)]$$

**Scale Discretization:**
Commonly use dyadic scales $a_j = 2^j$ or finer discretizations $a_j = 2^{j/v}$ for $v > 1$.

## 8. Statistical Properties and Performance Analysis

### 8.1 Bias Analysis

**Finite Sample Bias:**
Most wavelet-based estimators exhibit finite sample bias due to:
- Boundary effects
- Limited scale range
- Discretization effects

**Bias Correction Methods:**
1. **Analytical Corrections:** Based on known bias formulas
2. **Bootstrap Corrections:** Empirical bias estimation
3. **Jackknife Corrections:** Leave-one-out bias estimation

### 8.2 Variance Properties

**Asymptotic Variance:**
For most wavelet estimators:
$$\text{Var}(\hat{H}) \sim \frac{C}{J}$$

where $J$ is the number of scales used in regression and $C$ depends on the specific method.

**Variance-Bias Tradeoff:**
- More scales reduce variance but may increase bias
- Fewer scales increase variance but reduce bias
- Optimal scale selection balances this tradeoff

### 8.3 Efficiency Comparison

**Relative Efficiency:**
Wavelet methods generally achieve efficiency close to the Cramér-Rao bound under Gaussian assumptions.

**Robustness-Efficiency Tradeoff:**
- Classical methods (AV, SSB): High efficiency, moderate robustness
- Median-based methods: Lower efficiency, high robustness
- Trimean methods: Balanced efficiency and robustness

### 8.4 Confidence Intervals

**Asymptotic Confidence Intervals:**
$$\hat{H} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\widehat{\text{Var}}(\hat{H})}$$

**Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:**
More robust to departures from asymptotic assumptions:
1. Generate $B$ bootstrap samples
2. Compute $\hat{H}^{(b)}$ for each bootstrap sample
3. Use bootstrap quantiles for confidence bounds

**Empirical Coverage:**
Simulation studies show that bootstrap intervals generally provide better coverage properties than asymptotic intervals for finite samples.

## 9. Practical Implementation Considerations

### 9.1 Scale Selection

**Automatic Scale Selection:**
- **Visual Inspection:** Plot $\log_2(\hat{\mu}_j^2)$ vs. $j$ and identify linear region
- **Goodness-of-Fit:** Use $R^2$ or residual analysis to determine optimal range
- **Information Criteria:** AIC/BIC-based selection of scale range

**Common Guidelines:**
- Start from scale $j_1 = 2$ or $j_1 = 3$ to avoid high-frequency noise
- End at scale $j_2$ where $n_{j_2} \geq 10$ for reliable statistics
- Ensure at least 3-4 scales for stable regression

### 9.2 Wavelet Selection

**Vanishing Moments:**
Choose $N_0 \geq \max(1, \lceil H + 1/2 \rceil)$ to ensure bias control.

**Support Length:**
Balance between:
- Shorter support: Better time localization, more boundary effects
- Longer support: Better frequency localization, fewer boundary effects

**Orthogonality:**
Orthogonal wavelets (Daubechies) generally preferred for statistical estimation due to decorrelation properties.

### 9.3 Boundary Correction

**Periodic Extension:**
Assume signal is periodic for DWT computation. Simple but may introduce artifacts.

**Symmetric Extension:**
Extend signal symmetrically at boundaries. Reduces artifacts but may affect long-range properties.

**Wavelets on Interval:**
Use specially constructed wavelets that handle boundaries exactly. Computationally more complex but theoretically optimal.

### 9.4 Computational Complexity

**DWT-Based Methods:** $O(N)$ for signal length $N$
**NDWT-Based Methods:** $O(N \log N)$ for signal length $N$  
**CWT-Based Methods:** $O(N \log N)$ with FFT implementation

**Memory Requirements:**
- DWT: $O(N)$ 
- NDWT: $O(NJ)$ where $J$ is decomposition depth
- CWT: $O(NA)$ where $A$ is number of scales

## 10. Applications and Case Studies

### 10.1 Financial Time Series

**Characteristics:**
- High noise levels
- Non-Gaussian distributions
- Volatility clustering
- Non-stationarity

**Recommended Approaches:**
- Robust trimean estimators for noise resilience
- NDWT for translation invariance
- Multiple wavelet analysis for validation

**Example Results:**
Studies of financial returns typically find $H \approx 0.5$ (efficient market hypothesis) while volatility series often exhibit $H > 0.5$ (long memory in volatility).

### 10.2 Physiological Signals

**EEG Analysis:**
- Multi-channel recordings require multivariate methods
- Different frequency bands may have different scaling properties
- Clinical applications for seizure detection and brain state classification

**Heart Rate Variability:**
- Circadian rhythms create non-stationarity

### 15.4 Final Remarks

Wavelet-based methods have established themselves as the gold standard for Hurst exponent estimation, offering a powerful combination of theoretical rigor, computational efficiency, and practical robustness. The evolution from classical Abry-Veitch estimation to modern robust NDWT approaches with trimean estimators represents significant progress in addressing real-world challenges of noise, non-stationarity, and computational constraints.

The choice among available methods should be guided by specific application requirements, data characteristics, and computational resources. While no single method dominates across all scenarios, the trimean-based NDWT approaches (particularly GTLME and TTME) provide excellent general-purpose solutions that balance accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

As the field continues to evolve, the integration of machine learning techniques, development of adaptive algorithms, and extension to high-dimensional problems promise to further enhance the capabilities of wavelet-based LRD analysis. The solid theoretical foundations established over the past two decades provide a strong basis for these future developments.
