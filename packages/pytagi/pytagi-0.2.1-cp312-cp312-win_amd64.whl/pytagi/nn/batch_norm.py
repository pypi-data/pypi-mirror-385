    Applies 2D Batch Normalization.

    Batch Normalization normalizes the inputs of a layer by re-centering and
    re-scaling them.

    Args:
        num_features (int): The number of features in the input tensor.
        eps (float): A small value added to the variance to avoid division by zero.
                     Defaults to 1e-5.
        momentum (float): The momentum for the running mean and variance.
                          Defaults to 0.9.
        bias (bool): Whether to include a learnable bias term. Defaults to True.
        gain_weight (float): Initial value for the gain (scale) parameter. Defaults to 1.0.
        gain_bias (float): Initial value for the bias (shift) parameter. Defaults to 1.0.
