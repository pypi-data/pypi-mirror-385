## Version:1.0.0-rc.1 -- 11 Jun 2025

**Conductor Submitter Redesign**
*   Introduced three dedicated nodes Solaris, Husk, and ROP to provide tailored solutions for diverse rendering tasks.
*   Each node offers customized parameters and processes, eliminating unnecessary complexity and focusing on specific user needs.

**Solaris Submitter**
*   Retrieves image output paths directly from the USD stage, prioritizing the outputimage attribute in the USD Render ROP 
and falling back to productName in the first ancestor Render Product Node if unset.
*   Implemented logic to derive a common image output path when multiple render products are present in the USD stage.
*   Added validation checks to flag image output paths that are too shallow such as root level directories.

**Husk Submitter**
*   Refined USD dependency scraping for more reliable and accurate asset resolution.
*   Optimized the submission process by removing unnecessary extra files from uploads, reducing transfer times.

**ROP Submitter & General ROP Handling**
*   Dedicated ROP submitter

**General Fixes and Improvements**
*   Enhanced nearest-version selection algorithm for host software and drivers
*   Disabled deprecated image-path parameters

* 
* Version 1.0.0-beta.1
* Conductor Submitter Redesign: 
* Introducing 3 New Nodes — Solaris, Husk, and ROP Nodes
* We undertook a comprehensive redesign of the Houdini Conductor Submitter to elevate its functionality and user experience. 
* The updated design focuses on streamlining workflows, enhancing usability, and providing tailored solutions for diverse rendering tasks.
* By introducing distinct submitter nodes with customized parameters and workflows, we’ve ensured that users can focus on their specific needs without unnecessary clutter or complexity.


## Version:0.7.15 -- 20 Aug 2024
* LOPs node reference is now included in scraping
* Added instance type best fit logic
* Evaluates variable values, such as HIP in the output path parameter, ensuring they are dynamically resolved instead of being treated as literal strings.
* Removed redundant Not a drive letter. Skipping messages to streamline output and improve clarity.
* Enhanced the submitter to comprehensively print all potential output paths for each ROP, including direct parameters, USD stage attributes, environment variables, custom logic, and various dynamic cases. This ensures that all possible output locations are identified and displayed for complex rendering setups.
