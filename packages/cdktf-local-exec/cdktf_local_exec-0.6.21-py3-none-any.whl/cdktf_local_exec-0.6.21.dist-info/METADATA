A simple construct that executes a command locally. This is useful to run build steps within your CDKTF Program or to run a post action after a resource is created.

*cdktf-local-exec* is in technical preview, which means it's a community supported project. It still requires extensive testing and polishing to mature into a HashiCorp officially supported project. Please [file issues](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-local-exec/issues/new/choose) generously and detail your experience while using the library. We welcome your feedback.

## Compatibility

* `cdktf` >= 0.21.0
* `constructs` >= 10.4.2

## How It Works

The construct uses the null provider to achieve this so it can be trusted to only run after all dependencies are met.

## Usage

```python
import { Provider, LocalExec } from "cdktf-local-exec";

// LocalExec extends from the null provider,
// so if you already have the provider initialized you can skip this step
new Provider(this, "local-exec");

const frontend = new LocalExec(this, "frontend-build", {
  // Will copy this into an asset directory
  cwd: "/path/to/project/frontend",
  command: "npm install && npm build",
});

const pathToUpload = `${frontend.path}/dist`;

new LocalExec(this, "frontend-upload", {
  cwd: pathToUpload,
  command: `aws s3 cp --recursive ${pathToUpload} s3://${bucket.name}/frontend`,
});

new LocalExec(this, "backend-build", {
  cwd: "/path/to/project/backend",
  copyBeforeRun: false, // can not run remotely since the runner has no docker access
  command: "docker build -t foo . && docker push foo",
});
```

### Options

* `cwd`: The working directory to run the command in. It will be copied before execution to ensure the asset can be used in a remote execution environment.
* `command`: The command to execute.
* `copyBeforeRun`: If true, the command will copy the `cwd` directory into a tmp dir and run there. If false, the command will be executed in the `cwd` directory.
