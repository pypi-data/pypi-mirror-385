    Notes
    -----
    - Trips that lack start or end times are ignored, so the the
      aggregate ``num_trips`` across the day could be less than the
      ``num_trips`` column of :func:`compute_route_stats_0`
    - All trip departure times are taken modulo 24 hours.
      So routes with trips that end past 23:59:59 will have all
      their stats wrap around to the early morning of the time series,
      except for their ``num_trip_ends`` indicator.
      Trip endings past 23:59:59 are not binned so that resampling the
      ``num_trips`` indicator works efficiently.
    - Note that the total number of trips for two consecutive time bins
      t1 < t2 is the sum of the number of trips in bin t2 plus the
      number of trip endings in bin t1.
      Thus we can downsample the ``num_trips`` indicator by keeping
      track of only one extra count, ``num_trip_ends``, and can avoid
      recording individual trip IDs.
    - All other indicators are downsampled by summing.
