# grpctunnel-py

A Python port of [grpctunnel](https://github.com/jhump/grpctunnel) - a library for carrying gRPC over gRPC.

## About

This library enables tunneling gRPC connections through other gRPC connections. This provides two primary use cases:

1. **Forward Tunnels**: Pin multiple RPC calls to a single server backend, providing session affinity even when
   connecting through load balancers.

2. **Reverse Tunnels**: Allow servers to send RPC requests back to connected clients, enabling rich "server push"
   capabilities and allowing servers behind NAT/firewalls to be accessed.

## Attribution

This is a Python port of the original Go implementation created by **Joshua Humphries**.

This Python port maintains compatibility with the original Go implementation, allowing Python and Go clients/servers to
interoperate seamlessly.

## Installation

```bash
pip install grpctunnel
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add grpctunnel
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
