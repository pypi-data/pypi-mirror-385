# Mech-Eye Python Interface

This is the official Python interface for Mech-Eye cameras.

Please select the proper version corresponding to the camera firmware version.

## Features

With these interfaces, you can easily control your Mech-Eye cameras with Python programs. The features are as follows:

* Connect to your camera in your LAN.
* Set and get camera parameters such as exposure time, ROI, and so on.
* Capture color images, depth maps, and point clouds.

## Installation

### Dependencies

We ran and tested these interfaces on Python3.7 - Python3.11.

The `numpy` library is needed:

you can install numpy with pip using the following command:

```Python
pip install numpy
```

### Installing official version from PyPI using PIP

Use PIP to fetch the latest official version from PyPI:

```Python
pip install MechEyeAPI
```

On some systems Python3's `pip` is called `pip3`. In this guide we assume it is called `pip`. If you are using PIP with version 19 or higher, build dependencies are handled automatically.
