### ðŸ“‹ MR Summary
This merge request introduces an optional feature to the context generator that fetches and analyzes official CI/CD documentation for GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, providing up-to-date context for code reviews.

- **Key Changes:**
  - Adds `CIDocsProvider` and `CIDocsSection` to fetch and process CI/CD documentation.
  - Introduces the `--enable-ci-docs` CLI flag and a corresponding `CIDocsConfig` Pydantic model.
  - Updates the context template, configuration loading logic, and documentation to support the new feature.
- **Impact:**
  - Affects the `context_generator` tool by adding a new, optional "CI/CD Configuration Guide" section to the generated context file.
  - The feature is disabled by default, so there is no impact on existing workflows unless explicitly enabled.
- **Risk Level:** Low - This is an additive feature that is off by default and includes robust error handling and comprehensive tests.

### Detailed Code Review
This is a high-quality contribution that is well-designed, thoroughly tested, and clearly documented. The new feature integrates seamlessly into the existing architecture of sections and providers. The decision to make it opt-in is sensible for managing token costs. The prompt engineering in `ci_docs_section.py` is excellent, providing clear and specific instructions to the LLM.

The addition of unit tests for the new components significantly increases confidence in their reliability. The updates to user-facing documentation and the web UI are comprehensive and helpful.

A minor area for improvement is the repeated configuration loading logic in the CLI, which could be consolidated.

<summary><strong>ðŸ“„ `src/context_generator/cli.py`</strong> - Repetitive configuration loading logic</summary>

- **[Suggestion]** The logic for loading and overriding configuration for `Context7Config` and `CIDocsConfig` is nearly identical. This could be refactored into a generic helper function to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

  ```python
  # Example of a potential helper
  def _load_feature_config(
      model_cls: type[BaseSettings],
      yaml_config: dict[str, Any],
      config_key: str,
      cli_overrides: dict[str, Any]
  ) -> BaseSettings:
      # ... logic to load from env, then yaml, then cli ...
      pass
  ```

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ“„ `src/context_generator/providers/ci_docs_provider.py`</strong> - Hardcoded URLs</summary>

- **[Review]** The hardcoded URLs point to the `master`/`main` branches of the respective repositories. This is generally fine but could become a maintenance item if the file paths change in the upstream projects. This is an acceptable trade-off for simplicity. No action is required, but it's worth noting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸ“„ `src/context_generator/sections/context7_section.py`</strong> - CI/CD prompt is specific to GitLab</summary>

- **[Review]** The prompt enhancement in `_create_context7_prompt` is a great idea to get more specific CI/CD context. However, the added instructions are very specific to GitLab CI (e.g., mentioning `.gitlab-ci.yml files`). Since `CI_SYSTEM_CONTEXT7_LIBRARIES` also supports GitHub Actions, the prompt could be made more generic or conditional based on the detected `ci_system` to be accurate for both platforms.

  For example, instead of:
  > The documentation contains extensive YAML configuration examples for .gitlab-ci.yml files.

  It could be:
  > The documentation contains extensive YAML configuration examples for CI/CD workflow files (e.g., .gitlab-ci.yml, .github/workflows/*.yml).

</details>

### âœ… Summary
- **Overall Assessment:** Excellent. The MR is a well-executed, valuable addition. The code is clean, robust, and adheres to project standards. The inclusion of comprehensive tests and documentation is exemplary.
- **Priority Issues:** None.
- **Minor Suggestions:**
  - Refactor the duplicated configuration loading logic in `src/context_generator/cli.py`.
  - Generalize the CI/CD-specific prompt in `src/context_generator/sections/context7_section.py` to apply to both GitLab and GitHub Actions.
