Here's a step-by-step guide to assist you in your search:\n\n**Step 1: Determine Your Location**\nTo find a cardiologist, you'll need to know your location. This will help narrow down your search to cardiologists in your area. You can use online directories or search engines to find cardiologists near you.\n\n**Step 2: Check Your Insurance**\nBefore searching for a cardiologist, it's essential to check if your insurance plan covers cardiology services. You can contact your insurance provider to confirm their network of cardiologists and any specific requirements for referrals or pre-authorizations.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Your Needs**\nConsider what type of cardiologist you need. Are you looking for a pediatric cardiologist for a child, or an interventional cardiologist for a specific procedure? Knowing your needs will help you find a cardiologist with the right expertise.\n\n**Step 4: Search Online Directories**\nYou can use online directories like:\n- American Heart Association (AHA) DoctorFinder\n- American College of Cardiology (ACC) DoctorFinder\n- Healthgrades\n- Zocdoc\n- RateMDs\n\nThese directories allow you to search for cardiologists by location, insurance, and specialty.\n\n**Step 5: Check Reviews and Ratings**\nOnce you have a list of potential cardiologists, check their reviews and ratings on websites like Healthgrades, Zocdoc, or RateMDs. This will give you an idea of their reputation and patient satisfaction.\n\n**Step 6: Contact the Cardiologist's Office**\nAfter narrowing down your options, contact the cardiologist's office to ask about their availability, wait times, and any specific requirements for appointments.\n\n**Step 7: Schedule an Appointment**\nOnce you've found a cardiologist you're comfortable with, schedule an appointment to discuss your heart health concerns.\n\nAdditional Tips:\n\n- Ask your primary care physician for a referral to a cardiologist.\n- Check if the cardiologist is board-certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) or the American Board of Cardiovascular Medicine (ABCM).\n- Consider factors like office location, parking, and wait times when choosing a cardiologist.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to find a cardiologist who meets your needs and provides quality care.", 'reference_reply': 'When would you like to schedule your appointment?', 'generated_metadata': {'appointment_type': 'Cardiology', 'date': 'next Monday', 'time': '10 AM'}, 'reference_metadata': {}, 'guardrail_details': False, 'evaluation_results': {'judge_evaluations': {'openai': {'provider': 'openai', 'score': 0, 'label': 'Poor', 'justification': "The AGENT completely fails to address the user's request for scheduling an appointment, providing irrelevant and excessive information instead.", 'evidence': {'covered_points': [], 'missing_or_wrong': ['Scheduling an appointment', 'Response to user need', 'Conciseness']}, 'metadata': {'input_tokens': 775, 'output_tokens': 59}}, 'ionos': {'provider': 'ionos', 'score': 0, 'label': 'Poor', 'justification': "AGENT's reply is lengthy and does not directly address the user's request to see a cardiologist, instead providing a generic guide on how to find one.", 'evidence': {'covered_points': [], 'missing_or_wrong': ['direct scheduling or referral', "addressing user's immediate need", 'brevity and relevance']}, 'metadata': {'input_tokens': 776, 'output_tokens': 85}}}, 'metadata_evaluation': {}, 'guardrail_flag': 1}}, {'user_message': 'I would like to book it for next Monday morning.', 'generated_reply': "To better assist you with booking for next Monday morning, I need a bit more information.
