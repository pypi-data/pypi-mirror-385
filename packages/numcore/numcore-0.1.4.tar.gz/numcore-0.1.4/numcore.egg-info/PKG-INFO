# üßÆ numcore

A comprehensive mathematics library built from scratch by a first-year student. Currently in active development with a goal of **250+ functions**.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/numcore.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/numcore/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install numcore
```

## üìñ Usage

```python
from numcore import mean, median, analyze_list, factorial, is_prime, gcd

# Statistical analysis
data = [23, 45, 67, 45, 89, 34, 78, 98, 54, 55]
print(mean(data))      # 58.8
print(median(data))    # 54.5

# Comprehensive analysis
analysis = analyze_list(data)
print(analysis['mean'])
print(analysis['variance'])

# Number theory
print(factorial(5))           # 120
print(is_prime(17))          # True
print(gcd(48, 18))           # 6
print(prime_factorization(100))  # [2, 2, 5, 5]
```
