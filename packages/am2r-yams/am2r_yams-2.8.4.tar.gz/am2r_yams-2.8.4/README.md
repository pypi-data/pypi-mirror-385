# Yet Another Metroid2 Shuffler (YAMS)

A patcher for providing a different randomization experience to AM2R different to what the game has built-in. It was primarily designed for [Randovania](https://github.com/randovania/randovania), but it's also usable as a standalone patcher.  
Usage:  
`./YAMS-CLI [path-to-original-data-file] [path-to-output-data-file] [path-to-json-file]`

The API/Schema for the input json file will soon be documented. In the meantime, one can look at [this source file](https://github.com/randovania/YAMS/blob/main/YAMS-LIB/SeedObject.cs).
