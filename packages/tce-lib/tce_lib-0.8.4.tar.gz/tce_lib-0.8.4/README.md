## üîé What is tce-lib?

`tce-lib` is a library for creating and deploying tensor cluster expansion models of concentrated alloys following
our work on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04686). The core philosophy of `tce-lib` is to respect the 
[strategy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) as core to the library's functionality. This design
pattern stages workflows as sequences of strategies, of which the user can override each. This allows for the majority 
of users to plug-and-play for an ordinary workflow, while still supporting fine-grained autonomy for more advanced 
users.
