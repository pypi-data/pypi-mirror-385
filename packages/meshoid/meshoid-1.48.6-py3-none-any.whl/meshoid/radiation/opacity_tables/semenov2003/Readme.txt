The monochromatic dust opacity \kappa_lambda [cm^2/g] computed by 
Semenov et al. 2003 for the case of the "normal" silicate mineralogy. 
The folder names can be translated as follows:

Comp_aggregates - composite aggregate model of dust grains,
Hom_aggregates - homogeneous aggregate model of dust grains,
Hom_spheres - homogeneous spherical grains,
Comp_spheres - composite spherical grains,
Multishell_spheres - multishell spherical grains,
Porous_comp_spheres - porous composite spherical grains,
Porous_multishell_spheres - porous multishell spherical grains.

Each folder contains opacity data files for erey temperature region.
That is, "1.dat" corresponds to the first temperature region and so on.
