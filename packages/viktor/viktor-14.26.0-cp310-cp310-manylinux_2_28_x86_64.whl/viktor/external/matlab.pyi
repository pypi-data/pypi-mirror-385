class MatlabAnalysis(GenericAnalysis):
    ''' ::version(14.17.0)

    MatlabAnalysis can be used to evaluate a matlab script on third-party infrastructure. The script is expected
    to be blocking, i.e. if the executable is invoked from command prompt, it should wait until the script is
    finished. For security purposes the executable that should be called has to be defined in the configuration file
    of the worker.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        files = [
            (\'input1.txt\', file1),
            (\'input2.txt\', file2)
        ]
        analysis = MatlabAnalysis(files=files, output_filenames=["output.txt"])
        analysis.execute(timeout=60)
        output_file = analysis.get_output_file("output.txt")

    Exceptions which can be raised during calculation:

        - :class:`viktor.errors.LicenseError`: no license available
        - :class:`viktor.errors.ExecutionError`: generic error. Error message provides more information
