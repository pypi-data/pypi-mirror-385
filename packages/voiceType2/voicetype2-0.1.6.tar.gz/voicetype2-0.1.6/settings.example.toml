# VoiceType Configuration File - Example
# Copy this file to settings.toml and customize as needed

# =============================================================================
# PIPELINE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Pipelines define sequences of stages that process voice input.
# Multiple pipelines can be configured with different hotkeys.

# Example 1: Default voice-to-text pipeline
[[pipelines]]
name = "default"
enabled = true
hotkey = "<pause>"  # Pause/Break key

[[pipelines.stages]]
stage = "RecordAudio"
minimum_duration = 0.25  # Minimum audio duration in seconds

[[pipelines.stages]]
stage = "Transcribe"
provider = "local"  # Use local faster-whisper model

[[pipelines.stages]]
stage = "TypeText"


# Example 2: Alternative pipeline with different hotkey (commented out)
# [[pipelines]]
# name = "alt_transcribe"
# enabled = false
# hotkey = "<f12>"
#
# [[pipelines.stages]]
# stage = "RecordAudio"
#
# [[pipelines.stages]]
# stage = "Transcribe"
# provider = "litellm"  # Use cloud-based transcription
#
# [[pipelines.stages]]
# stage = "TypeText"


# =============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION NOTES
# =============================================================================
#

#   - Regular keys: a, b, 1, 2, etc.
#
# Provider Options:
#   - "local": Uses faster-whisper for local transcription (faster, offline)
#   - "litellm": Uses cloud-based transcription (requires API key)
#
# File Locations (searched in order):
#   1. ./settings.toml (current directory)
