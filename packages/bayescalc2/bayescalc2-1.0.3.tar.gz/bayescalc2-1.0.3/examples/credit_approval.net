# Simple Credit Approval Bayesian Network
# Models factors involved in credit approval decisions
#
# Network Structure:
#
#  Income     CreditHistory
#     \           /
#      \         /
#       v       v
#      CreditRisk
#          |
#          v
#    ApprovalChance
#
# Characteristics:
# - Mix of binary and multi-valued variables
# - Models financial decision process
# - Demonstrates practical application of Bayesian networks
# - Good for sensitivity analysis (how changes in income/credit history affect approval)
# - Simple structure suitable for explaining to non-technical stakeholders
