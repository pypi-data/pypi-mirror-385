# Plant Growth Network
# Simple model of factors influencing plant growth
#
# Network Structure:
#
#   Sunlight     Water
#       \         /
#        \       /
#         v     v
#     Plant Growth
#
# Characteristics:
# - Very simple 3-variable network with multi-valued variables
# - Good example for beginners to understand basic Bayesian networks
# - Demonstrates converging connections
# - Multi-valued variables show more complex relationships
# - Perfect for explaining joint probability distributions
