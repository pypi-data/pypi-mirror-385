# Naive Bayes Text Classification Network
# Models document classification based on word presence
#
# Network Structure:
#
#           Document Class
#        /       |       \
#       /        |        \
#      v         v         v
#   Word1      Word2     Word3
#
# Characteristics:
# - Classic naive Bayes structure
# - All Boolean variables
# - Demonstrates conditional independence assumptions
# - Good for explaining text classification
# - Shows how naive Bayes models work in practice
# - Simple enough for manual calculations
