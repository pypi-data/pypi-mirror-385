# Weather Prediction Network
# Simple model for weather forecasting
#
# Network Structure:
#
#  Pressure      Season
#      \          /
#       \        /
#        v      v
#      Temperature
#           |
#           v
#      Precipitation
#
# Characteristics:
# - 4-variable weather prediction network
# - Multi-valued variables
# - Shows seasonal dependencies
# - Good for demonstrating forward and backward inference
# - Models common sequential causal relationships
# - Practical application of Bayesian networks
