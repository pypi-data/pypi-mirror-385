# Classic Alarm Bayesian Network (Simplified)
# A canonical example often taught in introductory Bayesian network courses
#
# Network Structure:
#
#    Burglary     Earthquake
#       \             /
#        \           /
#         v         v
#          Alarm
#         /    \
#        v      v
#    JohnCalls  MaryCalls
#
# Characteristics:
# - All Boolean variables 
# - Demonstrates causal inference (causes -> effects)
# - Shows explaining away: observing Alarm makes Burglary and Earthquake dependent
# - Models noisy relationships between events
# - Common introductory example with intuitive scenario
