# Earthquake-Burglar-Alarm with Sensors Bayesian Network
# Extended version of the alarm network with reliability sensors
#
# Network Structure:
#
#   Burglary    Earthquake
#     \            /
#      \          /
#       v        v
#        Alarm
#       /     \
#      v       v
#   Sensor1   Sensor2
#
# Characteristics:
# - All Boolean variables 
# - Models noisy sensors (allows false positives/negatives)
# - Shows how multiple sensors increase detection reliability
# - Good for explaining sensor fusion concepts
# - Demonstrates reliability through redundancy
# - Simple enough for manual probability calculations
