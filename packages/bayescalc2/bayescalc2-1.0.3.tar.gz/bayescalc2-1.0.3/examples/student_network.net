# Student Example Bayesian Network
# Classic example used in teaching Bayesian networks
# 
# Network Structure:
#
#         Difficulty      Intelligence
#            |  \            /  \
#            |   \          /    \
#            |    v        v      v
#            |   Grade     SAT    Letter
#            |
#
# Characteristics:
# - Demonstrates converging connection (D,I -> G)
# - Shows how letter recommendation depends on grade
# - Contains mix of direct causal relationships
# - Good for explaining explaining away: observing G makes D and I dependent
# - Shows value of multi-valued variables in modeling academic scenarios
