## üîç Verification

After installation, verify SDG Hub is working correctly:

```python
# Test basic imports
from sdg_hub.core.flow import FlowRegistry
from sdg_hub.core.blocks import BlockRegistry

# Discover available components
FlowRegistry.discover_flows()
BlockRegistry.discover_blocks()

print("‚úÖ SDG Hub installed successfully!")
print(f"Available flows: {len(FlowRegistry.list_flows())}")
print(f"Available blocks: {len(BlockRegistry.list_blocks())}")
```
