    Extract all important named entities from the following text and organize them by category:

    Text to analyze:
    {{text}}

    Identify and categorize entities into:
    - **people**: Names of individuals, titles, roles
    - **organizations**: Companies, institutions, agencies, groups
    - **locations**: Cities, countries, regions, landmarks, addresses

    Rules:
    - Only include entities explicitly mentioned in the text
    - Use exact names as they appear
    - Focus on the most important entities (3-8 per category max)

    Provide your response in exactly this format:
    [ENTITIES]
    {
      "people": ["Person 1", "Person 2"],
      "organizations": ["Org 1", "Org 2"],
      "locations": ["Location 1"]
    }
    [/ENTITIES]

    If no entities are found for a category, use an empty list: []
    If no entities are found at all, respond with:
    [ENTITIES]
    {
      "people": [],
      "organizations": [],
      "locations": []
    }
    [/ENTITIES]
