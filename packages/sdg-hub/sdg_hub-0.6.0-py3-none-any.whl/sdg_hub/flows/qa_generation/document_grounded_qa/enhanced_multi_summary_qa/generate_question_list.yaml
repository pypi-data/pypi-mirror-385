    Develop a series of educational questions from a chapter in a {{domain}} textbook. 

    The questions should:
    * Self-contained – understandable without needing to reference tables, figures, or specific text sections.
    * Focus on the provided example and follow the format and style of the provided examples.
    * Relevant to the subject – based on the textbook’s domain (e.g., legal, scientific, etc.).
    * Independently answerable – avoid direct references to theorems, figures, or text numbers.
    * Varied in difficulty - Make difficult same as the provided examples.
    * Use same format as the provided examples.

    Strictly follow this format for each question your generate while responding

    [QUESTION]
    <Insert question here>
    [END]

    Each question and answer pair should stand alone as a mini-lesson, encapsulating a key concept or idea from the chapter in a way that is accessible and informative without requiring the reader to refer back to the textbook.

    Here are some examples of questions:

    [Document]
    {{icl_document}}

    [QUESTION]
    {{icl_query_1}}
    [END]

    [QUESTION]
    {{icl_query_2}}
    [END]

    [QUESTION]
    {{icl_query_3}}
    [END]

    Now, here is the document:
    [DOCUMENT]
    {{document_outline}}
    {{document}}
