# PyAstronomy

What is it?
-----------

  PyAstronomy is a collection of astronomy-related
  packages written in Python.

  Currently, the following subpackages are available:

    funcFit:    A convenient fitting package providing support
                for minimization and MCMC sampling.

    modelSuite: A Set of astrophysical models (e.g., transit
                light-curve modeling), which can be used
                stand-alone or with funcFit.

    AstroLib:   A set of useful routines including a number
                of ports from IDL's astrolib.

    Constants:  The package provides a number of often-needed
                constants.

    Timing:     Provides algorithms for timing analysis such as
                the Lomb-Scargle and the Generalized Lomb-Scargle
                periodogram

    pyaGUI:     A collection of GUI tools for interactive work.
