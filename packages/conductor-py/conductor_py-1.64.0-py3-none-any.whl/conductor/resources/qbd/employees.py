        NOTE: QuickBooks Desktop does not support
        pagination for employees; hence, there is no `cursor` parameter. Users typically
        have few employees.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          ids: Filter for specific employees by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return.

              **IMPORTANT**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
              employees. This parameter will limit the response size, but you cannot fetch
              subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the name-range parameters
              instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all employees without
              limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because employees typically have low record counts.

          name_contains: Filter for employees whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for employees whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          names: Filter for specific employees by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for an employee.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          name_starts_with: Filter for employees whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for employees that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for employees updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the following
              ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for employees updated on or before this date/time. Accepts the following
              ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

        NOTE: QuickBooks Desktop does not support
        pagination for employees; hence, there is no `cursor` parameter. Users typically
        have few employees.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          ids: Filter for specific employees by their QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return.

              **IMPORTANT**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
              employees. This parameter will limit the response size, but you cannot fetch
              subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the name-range parameters
              instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all employees without
              limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because employees typically have low record counts.

          name_contains: Filter for employees whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for employees whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          names: Filter for specific employees by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for an employee.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          name_starts_with: Filter for employees whose `name` starts with this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for employees whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for employees that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for employees updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the following
              ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for employees updated on or before this date/time. Accepts the following
              ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.
