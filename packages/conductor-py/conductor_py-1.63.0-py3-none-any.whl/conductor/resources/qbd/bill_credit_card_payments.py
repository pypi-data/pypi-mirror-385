        Each bill allocation must
        supply a payment amount, discount, or credit, and you have to use the same
        accounts payable account that’s on the bills being closed.

        Args:
          apply_to_transactions: The bills to be paid by this bill credit card payment. This will create a link
              between this bill credit card payment and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          credit_card_account_id: The credit card account to which this bill credit card payment is being charged.
              This bill credit card payment will decrease the balance of this account.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill credit card payment, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this bill credit card payment is paying and
              who will receive this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill credit card payment's currency and
              the home currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as
              a decimal value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home
              currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill credit card payment.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill credit card payment is
              assigned, used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop
              will use its default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill credit card payment is linked to other transactions,
              this A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other
              transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill credit card
              payment, which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value
              is not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks
              user. When left blank in this create request, this field will be left blank in
              QuickBooks (i.e., it does _not_ auto-increment).

          account_ids: Filter for bill credit card payments associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for bill credit card payments in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Do not include this parameter on the first call. Use the

              request will return an error.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith`
              or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal
              to this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the
              list. Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits;
              otherwise, uses a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bill credit card payments by their ref-number(s),
              case-sensitive. In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can
              be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `refNumber` starts with this
              substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or

          ref_number_to: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to
              this value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `date` field is on or after this
              date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **start of the
              specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g.,
              `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `date` field is on or before this
              date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified
              day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` →
              `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).

          updated_after: Filter for bill credit card payments updated on or after this date/time. Accepts
              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for bill credit card payments updated on or before this date/time.
              Accepts the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

        Each bill allocation must
        supply a payment amount, discount, or credit, and you have to use the same
        accounts payable account that’s on the bills being closed.

        Args:
          apply_to_transactions: The bills to be paid by this bill credit card payment. This will create a link
              between this bill credit card payment and the specified bills.

              **IMPORTANT**: In each `applyToTransactions` object, you must specify either
              `paymentAmount`, `applyCredits`, `discountAmount`, or any combination of these;
              if none of these are specified, you will receive an error for an empty
              transaction.

              **IMPORTANT**: The target bill must have `isPaid=false`, otherwise, QuickBooks
              will report this object as "cannot be found".

          credit_card_account_id: The credit card account to which this bill credit card payment is being charged.
              This bill credit card payment will decrease the balance of this account.

          transaction_date: The date of this bill credit card payment, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent the bill(s) that this bill credit card payment is paying and
              who will receive this payment.

              **IMPORTANT**: This vendor must match the `vendor` on the bill(s) specified in
              `applyToTransactions`; otherwise, QuickBooks will say the `transactionId` in
              `applyToTransactions` "does not exist".

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this bill credit card payment's currency and
              the home currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as
              a decimal value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home
              currency).

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          memo: A memo or note for this bill credit card payment.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this bill credit card payment is
              assigned, used to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop
              will use its default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this bill credit card payment is linked to other transactions,
              this A/P account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other
              transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this bill credit card
              payment, which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value
              is not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks
              user. When left blank in this create request, this field will be left blank in

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`

          ref_number_from: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal

              list. Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits;
              otherwise, uses a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific bill credit card payments by their ref-number(s),
              case-sensitive. In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can
              be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the

              this value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `date` field is on or after this
              date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **start of the
              specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g.,
              `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for bill credit card payments whose `date` field is on or before this
              date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified
              day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` →
              `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).

          updated_after: Filter for bill credit card payments updated on or after this date/time. Accepts
              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for bill credit card payments updated on or before this date/time.
              Accepts the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
