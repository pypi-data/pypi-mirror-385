        """Creates an item receipt to record inventory received from a vendor.

        You can link
        it to a purchase order during creation to pull in the order's lines
        automatically and update quantities, but that link can't be added later with an
        update.

        Args:
          transaction_date: The date of this item receipt, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this item receipt for goods or services purchased.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this item receipt's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expense_lines: The item receipt's expense lines, each representing one line in this expense.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          item_group_lines: The item receipt's item group lines, each representing a predefined set of items
              bundled together because they are commonly purchased together or grouped for
              faster entry.

          item_lines: The item receipt's item lines, each representing the purchase of a specific item
              or service.

          link_to_transaction_ids: IDs of existing purchase orders that you wish to link to this item receipt. Note
              that this links entire transactions, not individual transaction lines. If you
              want to link individual lines in a transaction, instead use the field
              `linkToTransactionLine` on this item receipt's lines, if available.

              Transactions can only be linked when creating this item receipt and cannot be
              unlinked later.

              You can use both `linkToTransactionIds` (on this item receipt) and
              `linkToTransactionLine` (on its transaction lines) as long as they do NOT link
              to the same transaction (otherwise, QuickBooks will return an error). QuickBooks
              will also return an error if you attempt to link a transaction that is empty or
              already closed.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the item
              receipt and check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of
              item receipts, you must also specify the parameter
              `includeLinkedTransactions=true` to see the `linkedTransactions` response field.

          memo: A memo or note for this item receipt.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this item receipt is assigned, used
              to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this item receipt is linked to other transactions, this A/P
              account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this item receipt, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.
              When left blank in this create request, this field will be left blank in
              QuickBooks (i.e., it does _not_ auto-increment).

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this item receipt, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. If set, this overrides any sales-tax codes defined on the vendor.
              This can be overridden on the item receipt's individual lines.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through
        the results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for item receipts associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for item receipts in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Do not include this parameter on the first call. Use the
              `nextCursor` value returned in the previous response to request subsequent
              results.

          ids: Filter for specific item receipts by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding item receipt.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` contains this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith`
              or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` ends with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific item receipts by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for item receipts whose `date` field is on or after this date, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **start of the
              specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g.,
              `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for item receipts whose `date` field is on or before this date, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified
              day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` →
              `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).

          updated_after: Filter for item receipts updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for item receipts updated on or before this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

        update.

        Args:
          transaction_date: The date of this item receipt, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this item receipt for goods or services purchased.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this item receipt's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expense_lines: The item receipt's expense lines, each representing one line in this expense.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          item_group_lines: The item receipt's item group lines, each representing a predefined set of items
              bundled together because they are commonly purchased together or grouped for
              faster entry.

          item_lines: The item receipt's item lines, each representing the purchase of a specific item
              or service.

          link_to_transaction_ids: IDs of existing purchase orders that you wish to link to this item receipt. Note
              that this links entire transactions, not individual transaction lines. If you
              want to link individual lines in a transaction, instead use the field
              `linkToTransactionLine` on this item receipt's lines, if available.

              Transactions can only be linked when creating this item receipt and cannot be
              unlinked later.

              You can use both `linkToTransactionIds` (on this item receipt) and
              `linkToTransactionLine` (on its transaction lines) as long as they do NOT link
              to the same transaction (otherwise, QuickBooks will return an error). QuickBooks
              will also return an error if you attempt to link a transaction that is empty or
              already closed.

              **IMPORTANT**: By default, QuickBooks will not return any information about the
              linked transactions in this endpoint's response even when this request is
              successful. To see the transactions linked via this field, refetch the item
              receipt and check the `linkedTransactions` response field. If fetching a list of
              item receipts, you must also specify the parameter
              `includeLinkedTransactions=true` to see the `linkedTransactions` response field.

          memo: A memo or note for this item receipt.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this item receipt is assigned, used
              to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this item receipt is linked to other transactions, this A/P
              account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this item receipt, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.
              When left blank in this create request, this field will be left blank in
              QuickBooks (i.e., it does _not_ auto-increment).

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this item receipt, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. If set, this overrides any sales-tax codes defined on the vendor.
              This can be overridden on the item receipt's individual lines.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

        Updates an existing item receipt.

        Args:
          id: The QuickBooks-assigned unique identifier of the item receipt to update.

          revision_number: The current QuickBooks-assigned revision number of the item receipt object you
              are updating, which you can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most
              recent `revisionNumber` to ensure you're working with the latest data;
              otherwise, the update will return an error.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          clear_expense_lines: When `true`, removes all existing expense lines associated with this item
              receipt. To modify or add individual expense lines, use the field `expenseLines`
              instead.

          clear_item_lines: When `true`, removes all existing item lines associated with this item receipt.
              To modify or add individual item lines, use the field `itemLines` instead.

          exchange_rate: The market exchange rate between this item receipt's currency and the home
              currency in QuickBooks at the time of this transaction. Represented as a decimal
              value (e.g., 1.2345 for 1 EUR = 1.2345 USD if USD is the home currency).

          expense_lines: The item receipt's expense lines, each representing one line in this expense.

              **IMPORTANT**:

              1. Including this array in your update request will **REPLACE** all existing
                 expense lines for the item receipt with this array. To keep any existing
                 expense lines, you must include them in this array even if they have not
                 changed. **Any expense lines not included will be removed.**

              2. To add a new expense line, include it here with the `id` field set to `-1`.

              3. If you do not wish to modify any expense lines, omit this field entirely to
                 keep them unchanged.

          item_group_lines: The item receipt's item group lines, each representing a predefined set of items
              bundled together because they are commonly purchased together or grouped for
              faster entry.

              **IMPORTANT**:

              1. Including this array in your update request will **REPLACE** all existing
                 item group lines for the item receipt with this array. To keep any existing
                 item group lines, you must include them in this array even if they have not
                 changed. **Any item group lines not included will be removed.**

              2. To add a new item group line, include it here with the `id` field set to
                 `-1`.

              3. If you do not wish to modify any item group lines, omit this field entirely
                 to keep them unchanged.

          item_lines: The item receipt's item lines, each representing the purchase of a specific item
              or service.

              **IMPORTANT**:

              1. Including this array in your update request will **REPLACE** all existing
                 item lines for the item receipt with this array. To keep any existing item
                 lines, you must include them in this array even if they have not changed.
                 **Any item lines not included will be removed.**

              2. To add a new item line, include it here with the `id` field set to `-1`.

              3. If you do not wish to modify any item lines, omit this field entirely to keep
                 them unchanged.

          memo: A memo or note for this item receipt.

          payables_account_id: The Accounts-Payable (A/P) account to which this item receipt is assigned, used
              to track the amount owed. If not specified, QuickBooks Desktop will use its
              default A/P account.

              **IMPORTANT**: If this item receipt is linked to other transactions, this A/P
              account must match the `payablesAccount` used in those other transactions.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this item receipt, which
              can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

          sales_tax_code_id: The sales-tax code for this item receipt, determining whether it is taxable or
              non-taxable. If set, this overrides any sales-tax codes defined on the vendor.
              This can be overridden on the item receipt's individual lines.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          transaction_date: The date of this item receipt, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          vendor_id: The vendor who sent this item receipt for goods or services purchased.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

        Use the `cursor` parameter to paginate through
        the results.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for item receipts associated with these accounts.

          currency_ids: Filter for item receipts in these currencies.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the
              `limit` parameter. Do not include this parameter on the first call. Use the
              `nextCursor` value returned in the previous response to request subsequent
              results.

          ids: Filter for specific item receipts by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          include_linked_transactions: Whether to include linked transactions in the response. Defaults to `false`. For
              example, a payment linked to the corresponding item receipt.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` contains this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith`
              or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` ends with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list. Uses
              a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific item receipts by their ref-number(s), case-sensitive. In
              QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can be arbitrarily
              changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for item receipts whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this value.
              If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for item receipts whose `date` field is on or after this date, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **start of the
              specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g.,
              `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for item receipts whose `date` field is on or before this date, in ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified
              day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` →
              `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).

          updated_after: Filter for item receipts updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for item receipts updated on or before this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
