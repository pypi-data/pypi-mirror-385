        Creates a new time tracking activity.

          duration: The time spent performing the service during this time tracking activity, in ISO
              8601 format for time intervals (PTnHnMnS). For example, 1 hour and 30 minutes is
              represented as PT1H30M.

              **NOTE**: Although seconds can be specified when creating a time tracking
              activity, they are not returned in responses since QuickBooks Desktop's UI does
              not display seconds.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field is required for updating time tracking activities,
              even if the field is not being modified, because of a bug in QuickBooks itself.

          entity_id: The employee, vendor, or person on QuickBooks's "Other Names" list whose time is
              being tracked in this time tracking activity. This cannot refer to a customer -
              use the `customer` field to associate a customer or customer-job with this time
              tracking activity.

          transaction_date: The date of this time tracking activity, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          billing_status: The billing status of this time tracking activity.

              **IMPORTANT**: When this field is set to "billable" for time tracking
              activities, both `customer` and `serviceItem` are required so that an invoice
              can be created.

          class_id: The time tracking activity's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects
              into meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          customer_id: The customer or customer-job to which this time tracking activity could be
              billed. If `billingStatus` is set to "billable", this field is required.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          note: A note or comment about this time tracking activity.

          payroll_wage_item_id: The payroll wage item (e.g., Regular Pay, Overtime Pay) to use for this time
              tracking activity. This field can only be used for time tracking if: (1) the
              person specified in `entity` is an employee in QuickBooks, and (2) the "Use time
              data to create paychecks" preference is enabled in their payroll settings.

          service_item_id: The type of service performed during this time tracking activity, referring to
              billable or purchasable services such as specialized labor, consulting hours,
              and professional fees.

              **NOTE**: This field is not required if no `customer` is specified. However, if
              `billingStatus` is set to "billable", both this field and `customer` are
              required.

              date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified

              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for time tracking activities updated on or before this date/time. Accepts
              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the

              **IMPORTANT**: This field is required for updating time tracking activities,

          billing_status: The billing status of this time tracking activity.

              **IMPORTANT**: When this field is set to "billable" for time tracking
              activities, both `customer` and `serviceItem` are required so that an invoice
              can be created.

          class_id: The time tracking activity's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects
              into meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          customer_id: The customer or customer-job to which this time tracking activity could be
              billed. If `billingStatus` is set to "billable", this field is required.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              data to create paychecks" preference is enabled in their payroll settings.

              billable or purchasable services such as specialized labor, consulting hours,
              and professional fees.

              **NOTE**: This field is not required if no `customer` is specified. However, if

              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for time tracking activities whose `date` field is on or after this date,
              in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **start of the
              specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g.,
              `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for time tracking activities whose `date` field is on or before this
              date, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified
              day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` →
              `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).

          updated_after: Filter for time tracking activities updated on or after this date/time. Accepts
              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for time tracking activities updated on or before this date/time. Accepts
              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.
