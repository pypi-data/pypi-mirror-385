          name: The case-insensitive unique name of this other-name, unique across all
              other-names.

              **NOTE**: Other-names do not have a `fullName` field because they are not
              hierarchical objects, which is why `name` is unique for them but not for objects
              that have parents.

              Maximum length: 31 characters.

              set and retrieved through the API.

          alternate_contact: The name of a alternate contact person for this other-name.

          alternate_phone: The other-name's alternate telephone number.

              invoices, checks, and other forms.

          contact: The name of the primary contact person for this other-name.

          email: The other-name's email address.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking

              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,

        NOTE: QuickBooks Desktop does not support
        pagination for other-names; hence, there is no `cursor` parameter. Users
        typically have few other-names.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          ids: Filter for specific other-names by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return.

              **IMPORTANT**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
              other-names. This parameter will limit the response size, but you cannot fetch
              subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the name-range parameters
              instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all other-names without
              limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because other-names typically have low record counts.

          name_contains: Filter for other-names whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for other-names whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for other-names whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          names: Filter for specific other-names by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for an other-name.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          name_starts_with: Filter for other-names whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for other-names whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for other-names that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for other-names updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the following
              ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for other-names updated on or before this date/time. Accepts the

                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop

              instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all other-names without
              limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because other-names typically have low record counts.

          name_contains: Filter for other-names whose `name` contains this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for other-names whose `name` ends with this substring, case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for other-names whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or equal to
              this value.

          names: Filter for specific other-names by their name(s), case-insensitive. Like `id`,
              `name` is a unique identifier for an other-name.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          name_starts_with: Filter for other-names whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for other-names whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal to this
              value.

          status: Filter for other-names that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for other-names updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the following
              ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for other-names updated on or before this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.
