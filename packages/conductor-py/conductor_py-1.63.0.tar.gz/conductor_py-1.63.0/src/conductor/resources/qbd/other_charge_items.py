        Creates a new other charge item.

        Args:
          name: The case-insensitive name of this other charge item. Not guaranteed to be unique
              because it does not include the names of its hierarchical parent objects like
              `fullName` does. For example, two other charge items could both have the `name`
              "Overnight Delivery", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Shipping Charges:Overnight Delivery" and "Misc Fees:Overnight Delivery".

              Maximum length: 31 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          barcode: The other charge item's barcode.

          class_id: The other charge item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          is_active: Indicates whether this other charge item is active. Inactive objects are
              typically hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks. Defaults to `true`.

          parent_id: The parent other charge item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For
              example, if this other charge item has a `fullName` of "Shipping
              Charges:Overnight Delivery", its parent has a `fullName` of "Shipping Charges".
              If this other charge item is at the top level, this field will be `null`.

          sales_and_purchase_details: Details for other charge items that are both purchased and sold, such as
              reimbursable expenses or inventory items that are bought from vendors and sold
              to customers.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `salesAndPurchaseDetails` or
              `salesOrPurchaseDetails` when creating an other charge item, but never both
              because an item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_or_purchase_details: Details for other charge items that are exclusively sold or exclusively
              purchased, but not both. This typically applies to non-inventory items (like a
              purchased office supply that isn't resold) or service items (like consulting
              services that are sold but not purchased).

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `salesOrPurchaseDetails` or
              `salesAndPurchaseDetails` when creating an other charge item, but never both
              because an item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_tax_code_id: The default sales-tax code for this other charge item, determining whether it is
              taxable or non-taxable. This can be overridden at the transaction-line level.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales
              tax (via the "Do You Charge Sales Tax?" preference), it will assign the default
              non-taxable code to all sales.

          cursor: The pagination token to fetch the next set of results when paginating with the

          full_names: Filter for specific other charge items by their full-name(s), case-insensitive.

              the `name` "Overnight Delivery", its `fullName` would be "Shipping
              Charges:Overnight Delivery".

              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the

              request will return an error.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          name_contains: Filter for other charge items whose `name` contains this substring,
              case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for other charge items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for other charge items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or
              equal to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for other charge items whose `name` starts with this substring,

              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for other charge items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal
              to this value.

          status: Filter for other charge items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for other charge items updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              `fullName` does. For example, two other charge items could both have the `name`
              "Overnight Delivery", but they could have unique `fullName` values, such as
              "Shipping Charges:Overnight Delivery" and "Misc Fees:Overnight Delivery".

              Maximum length: 31 characters.

          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,

          barcode: The other charge item's barcode.

          class_id: The other charge item's class. Classes can be used to categorize objects into
              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default.

          external_id: A globally unique identifier (GUID) you, the developer, can provide for tracking
              this object in your external system. This field is immutable and can only be set
              during object creation.

              **IMPORTANT**: This field must be formatted as a valid GUID; otherwise,
              QuickBooks will return an error.

          is_active: Indicates whether this other charge item is active. Inactive objects are
              typically hidden from views and reports in QuickBooks. Defaults to `true`.

          parent_id: The parent other charge item one level above this one in the hierarchy. For
              example, if this other charge item has a `fullName` of "Shipping
              Charges:Overnight Delivery", its parent has a `fullName` of "Shipping Charges".
              If this other charge item is at the top level, this field will be `null`.

          sales_and_purchase_details: Details for other charge items that are both purchased and sold, such as
              reimbursable expenses or inventory items that are bought from vendors and sold
              to customers.

              **IMPORTANT**: You must specify either `salesAndPurchaseDetails` or
              `salesOrPurchaseDetails` when creating an other charge item, but never both
              because an item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_or_purchase_details: Details for other charge items that are exclusively sold or exclusively
              purchased, but not both. This typically applies to non-inventory items (like a
              purchased office supply that isn't resold) or service items (like consulting

              `salesAndPurchaseDetails` when creating an other charge item, but never both
              because an item cannot have both configurations.

          sales_tax_code_id: The default sales-tax code for this other charge item, determining whether it is
              taxable or non-taxable. This can be overridden at the transaction-line level.

              Default codes include "Non" (non-taxable) and "Tax" (taxable), but custom codes
              can also be created in QuickBooks. If QuickBooks is not set up to charge sales

              colons. For example, if an other charge item is under "Shipping Charges" and has
              the `name` "Overnight Delivery", its `fullName` would be "Shipping
              Charges:Overnight Delivery".

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          ids: Filter for specific other charge items by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return. Accepts values ranging from 1 to 150,
              defaults to 150. When used with cursor-based pagination, this parameter controls
              how many results are returned per page. To paginate through results, combine
              this with the `cursor` parameter. Each response will include a `nextCursor`
              value that can be passed to subsequent requests to retrieve the next page of
              results.

          name_contains: Filter for other charge items whose `name` contains this substring,
              case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameStartsWith` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_ends_with: Filter for other charge items whose `name` ends with this substring,
              case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameStartsWith`.

          name_from: Filter for other charge items whose `name` is alphabetically greater than or
              equal to this value.

          name_starts_with: Filter for other charge items whose `name` starts with this substring,
              case-insensitive.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `nameContains` or
              `nameEndsWith`.

          name_to: Filter for other charge items whose `name` is alphabetically less than or equal
              to this value.

          status: Filter for other charge items that are active, inactive, or both.

          updated_after: Filter for other charge items updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for other charge items updated on or before this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.
