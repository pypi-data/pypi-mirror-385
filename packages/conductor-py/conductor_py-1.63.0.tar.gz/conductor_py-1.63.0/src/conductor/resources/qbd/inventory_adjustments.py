              meaningful segments, such as department, location, or type of work. In
              QuickBooks, class tracking is off by default. A class defined here is

              inventory item's quantity, value, serial number, or lot number.

          memo: A memo or note for this inventory adjustment.

          ref_number: The case-sensitive user-defined reference number for this inventory adjustment,
              which can be used to identify the transaction in QuickBooks. This value is not
              required to be unique and can be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

        NOTE: QuickBooks Desktop does not
        support pagination for inventory adjustments; hence, there is no `cursor`
        parameter. Users typically have few inventory adjustments.

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these accounts.

          customer_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          item_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments containing these inventory items.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return.

              **IMPORTANT**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
              inventory adjustments. This parameter will limit the response size, but you
              cannot fetch subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the
              name-range parameters instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all inventory adjustments
              without limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because inventory adjustments typically have low record counts.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` contains this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith`
              or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their ref-number(s),
              case-sensitive. In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can
              be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `date` field is on or after this date, in
              ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **start of the
              specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g.,
              `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `date` field is on or before this date,
              in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified
              day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` →
              `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).

          updated_after: Filter for inventory adjustments updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for inventory adjustments updated on or before this date/time. Accepts
              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop

        Args:
          conductor_end_user_id: The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,
              `"Conductor-End-User-Id: {{END_USER_ID}}"`).

          account_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these accounts.

          customer_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments associated with these customers.

          ids: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their QuickBooks-assigned unique
              identifier(s).

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the

          include_line_items: Whether to include line items in the response. Defaults to `true`.

          item_ids: Filter for inventory adjustments containing these inventory items.

          limit: The maximum number of objects to return.

              **IMPORTANT**: QuickBooks Desktop does not support cursor-based pagination for
              inventory adjustments. This parameter will limit the response size, but you
              cannot fetch subsequent results using a cursor. For pagination, use the
              name-range parameters instead (e.g., `nameFrom=A&nameTo=B`).

              When this parameter is omitted, the endpoint returns all inventory adjustments
              without limit, unlike paginated endpoints which default to 150 records. This is
              acceptable because inventory adjustments typically have low record counts.

          ref_number_contains: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` contains this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberStartsWith`
              or `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_ends_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` ends with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberStartsWith`.

          ref_number_from: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is greater than or equal to
              this value. If omitted, the range will begin with the first number of the list.
              Uses a numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses
              a lexicographical comparison.

          ref_numbers: Filter for specific inventory adjustments by their ref-number(s),
              case-sensitive. In QuickBooks, ref-numbers are not required to be unique and can
              be arbitrarily changed by the QuickBooks user.

              **IMPORTANT**: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other
              query parameters for this request.

              **NOTE**: If any of the values you specify in this parameter are not found, the
              request will return an error.

          ref_number_starts_with: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` starts with this substring.

              **NOTE**: If you use this parameter, you cannot also use `refNumberContains` or
              `refNumberEndsWith`.

          ref_number_to: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `refNumber` is less than or equal to this
              value. If omitted, the range will end with the last number of the list. Uses a
              numerical comparison for values that contain only digits; otherwise, uses a
              lexicographical comparison.

          transaction_date_from: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `date` field is on or after this date, in
              ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **start of the
              specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g.,
              `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).

          transaction_date_to: Filter for inventory adjustments whose `date` field is on or before this date,
              in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

              **NOTE:** QuickBooks Desktop interprets this date as the **end of the specified
              day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` →
              `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).

          updated_after: Filter for inventory adjustments updated on or after this date/time. Accepts the
              following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **start of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's
                computer (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T00:00:00`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.

          updated_before: Filter for inventory adjustments updated on or before this date/time. Accepts
              the following ISO 8601 formats:

              - **date-only** (YYYY-MM-DD) - QuickBooks Desktop interprets the date as the
                **end of the specified day** in the local timezone of the end-user's computer
                (e.g., `2025-01-01` → `2025-01-01T23:59:59`).
              - **datetime without timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp in the local timezone of the end-user's computer.
              - **datetime with timezone** (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss±HH:mm) - QuickBooks Desktop
                interprets the timestamp using the specified timezone.
