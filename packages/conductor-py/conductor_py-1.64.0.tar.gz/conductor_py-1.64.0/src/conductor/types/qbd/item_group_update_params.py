    The current QuickBooks-assigned revision number of the item group object you are
    updating, which you can get by fetching the object first. Provide the most
    recent `revisionNumber` to ensure you're working with the latest data;
    otherwise, the update will return an error.

    The ID of the EndUser to receive this request (e.g.,

    Indicates whether to allow changing the item group's unit-of-measure set (using
    the `unitOfMeasureSetId` field) when the base unit of the new unit-of-measure
    set does not match that of the currently assigned set. Without setting this
    field to `true` in this scenario, the request will fail with an error; hence,
    this field is equivalent to accepting the warning prompt in the QuickBooks UI.

    NOTE: Changing the base unit requires you to update the item's
    quantities-on-hand and cost to reflect the new unit; otherwise, these values
    will be inaccurate. Alternatively, consider creating a new item with the desired
    unit-of-measure set and deactivating the old item.

    The case-insensitive unique name of this item group, unique across all item

    **NOTE**: Item groups do not have a `fullName` field because they are not
    hierarchical objects, which is why `name` is unique for them but not for objects
    that have parents.
