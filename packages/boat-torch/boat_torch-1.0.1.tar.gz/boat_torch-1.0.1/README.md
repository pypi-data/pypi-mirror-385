**BOAT** is a task-agnostic, gradient-based **Bi-Level Optimization (BLO)** Python library that focuses on abstracting the key BLO process into modular, flexible components. It enables researchers and developers to tackle learning tasks with hierarchical nested nature by providing customizable and diverse operator decomposition, encapsulation, and combination. BOAT supports specialized optimization strategies, including second-order or first-order, nested or non-nested, and with or without theoretical guarantees, catering to various levels of complexity.

To enhance flexibility and efficiency, BOAT incorporates the **Dynamic Operation Library (D-OL)** and the **Hyper Operation Library (H-OL)**, alongside a collection of state-of-the-art first-order optimization strategies. BOAT also provides multiple implementation versions:
- **[PyTorch-based](https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT)**: An efficient and widely-used version.
- **[Jittor-based](https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT/tree/boat_jit)**: An accelerated version for high-performance tasks.
- **[MindSpore-based](https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT/tree/boat_ms)**: Incorporating the latest first-order optimization strategies to support emerging application scenarios.

##  üöÄ **Why BOAT?**
Existing automatic differentiation (AD) tools primarily focus on specific optimization strategies, such as explicit or implicit methods, and are often targeted at meta-learning or specific application scenarios, lacking support for algorithm customization. 

In contrast, **BOAT** expands the landscape of Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) applications by supporting a broader range of problem-adaptive operations. It bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment, offering unparalleled flexibility to design, customize, and accelerate BLO techniques.


##  üè≠ **Applications**
BOAT enables efficient implementation and adaptation of advanced BLO techniques for key applications, including but not limited to:
- **Hyperparameter Optimization (HO)**
- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**
- **Adversarial Training (AT)**
- **Few-Shot Learning (FSL)**
- **Generative Adversarial Learning**
- **Transfer Attack**
- ...

##  üî® **Installation**
To install BOAT, use the following command:
```bash
pip install boat-torch 
or run 
git clone https://github.com/callous-youth/BOAT.git
cd BOAT
pip install -e .
```

##  ‚ö° **How to Use BOAT**

### **1. Load Configuration Files**
BOAT relies on two key configuration files:
- `boat_config.json`: Specifies optimization strategies and dynamic/hyper-gradient operations.
- `loss_config.json`: Defines the loss functions for both levels of the BLO process.

```python
import os
import json
import boat_torch as torch

# Load configuration files
with open("path_to_configs/boat_config.json", "r") as f:
    boat_config = json.load(f)

with open("path_to_configs/loss_config.json", "r") as f:
    loss_config = json.load(f)
```

### **2. Define Models and Optimizers**
You need to specify both the upper-level and lower-level models along with their respective optimizers.

```python
import torch

# Define models
upper_model = UpperModel(*args, **kwargs)  # Replace with your upper-level model
lower_model = LowerModel(*args, **kwargs)  # Replace with your lower-level model

# Define optimizers
upper_opt = torch.optim.Adam(upper_model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
lower_opt = torch.optim.SGD(lower_model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```

### **3. Customize BOAT Configuration**
Modify the boat_config to include your dynamic and hyper-gradient methods, as well as model and variable details.

```python
# Example dynamic and hyper-gradient methods Combination.
dynamic_method = ["NGD", "DI", "GDA"]  # Dynamic Methods (Demo Only)
hyper_method = ["RGT","RAD"]          # Hyper-Gradient Methods (Demo Only)

# Add methods and model details to the configuration
boat_config["dynamic_op"] = dynamic_method
boat_config["hyper_op"] = hyper_method
boat_config["lower_level_model"] = lower_model
boat_config["upper_level_model"] = upper_model
boat_config["lower_level_opt"] = lower_opt
boat_config["upper_level_opt"] = upper_opt
boat_config["lower_level_var"] = list(lower_model.parameters())
boat_config["upper_level_var"] = list(upper_model.parameters())
```

### **4. Initialize the BOAT Problem**
Modify the boat_config to include your dynamic and hyper-gradient methods, as well as model and variable details.

```python
# Initialize the problem
b_optimizer = boat.Problem(boat_config, loss_config)

# Build solvers for lower and upper levels
b_optimizer.build_ll_solver()  # Lower-level solver
b_optimizer.build_ul_solver()  # Upper-level solver
```

### **5. Define Data Feeds**
Prepare the data feeds for both levels of the BLO process, which was further fed into the the upper-level  and lower-level objective functions. 

```python
# Define data feeds (Demo Only)
ul_feed_dict = {"data": upper_level_data, "target": upper_level_target}
ll_feed_dict = {"data": lower_level_data, "target": lower_level_target}
```

### **6. Run the Optimization Loop**
Execute the optimization loop, optionally customizing the solver strategy for dynamic methods.

```python
# Set number of iterations
iterations = 1000

# Optimization loop (Demo Only)
for x_itr in range(iterations):
    # Run a single optimization iteration
    loss, run_time = b_optimizer.run_iter(ll_feed_dict, ul_feed_dict, current_iter=x_itr)

```
