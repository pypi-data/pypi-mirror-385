## 🧠 1. Agentic AI – Intelligent Automation System
The **Agentic AI module** integrates an intelligent assistant directly into the Vallaipallam environment.

- Launches a **GUI-based AI control panel** built with `tkinter`.  
- Executes `.jnr` or `.vallai` scripts interactively and also other languages.  
- Integrates with external AI APIs to automate tasks, generate scripts, or analyse data.  
- Handles real-time workflow execution within the same interface.  
-Generate codes

## 🌐 2. V-NAS (Vallaipallam NetworkOps Automation Suite)
**V-NAS** automates system networking and diagnostic tasks using a Vallaipallam source code.
Commands are available in Tamil,Hindi and English.

Supported operations:
- `ENABLE_INTERFACE <interface>` – Activates a network adapter.  
- `DISABLE_INTERFACE <interface>` – Disables a specific adapter.  
- `PING <ip>` – Checks connectivity to a target.  
- `TRACEROUTE <ip>` – Displays route path to destination.  
- `SET_IP <interface> <ip>` – Assigns a static IP address.  
- `PORT_SCAN <ip>` – Scans open ports.  
- `CONNECT_WIFI <ssid> <password>` – Connects to a Wi-Fi network.

V-NAS gives developers **real network automation** inside a programmable regional shell, making complex networking operations simple and readable.
