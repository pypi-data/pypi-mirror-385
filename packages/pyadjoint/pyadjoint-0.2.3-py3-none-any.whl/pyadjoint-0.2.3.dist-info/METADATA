# Pyadjoint

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyadjoint.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyadjoint)

### Misfit measurement and adjoint source generation

- Pyadjoint is a small misfit measurement package that calculates misfit and adjoint sources on time series
- [Documentation](https://adjtomo.github.io/pyadjoint) for Pyadjoint can be found on GitHub
- Can be used standlone, but is also wrapped in [Pyatoa](https://github.com/adjtomo/pyatoa) (alongside 
  [Pyflex](https://github.com/adjtomo/pyflex))
- Pyadjoint is part of the [adjTomo ecosystem](https://github.com/adjtomo) of tools for 
  adjoint tomography and full waveform inversion
