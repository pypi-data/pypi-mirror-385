// A representation of a grid connection point. This is the point where a
// microgrid connects to the grid.
//
// The terms "Grid Connection Point" and "Point of Common Coupling" (PCC) are
// commonly used in the context.
//
// While both terms describe a connection point to the grid, the
// `GridConnectionPoint` is specifically the physical connection point of the
// generation facility to the grid, often concerned with the technical and
// ownership aspects of the connection.
//
// In contrast, the PCC is is more specific in terms of electrical engineering.
// It refers to the point where a customer's local electrical system (such as a
// microgrid) connects to the utility distribution grid in such a way that it
// can affect other customersâ€™ systems connected to the same network. It is the
// point where the grid and customer's electrical systems interface and where
// issues like power quality and supply regulations are assessed.
//
// The term `GridConnectionPoint` is used to make it clear that what is referred
// to here is the physical connection point of the local facility to the grid.
// Note that this may also be the PCC in some cases.
message GridConnectionPoint {
  // This refers to the maximum amount of electrical current, in amperes, that a
  // fuse at the grid connection point is designed to safely carry under normal
  // operating conditions.
  //
  // This limit applies to currents both flowing in or out of each of the 3
  // phases individually.
  //
  // In other words, a current _i_ A at one of the phases of the grid connection
  // point must comply with the following constraint:
  // `-rated_fuse_current <= i <= rated_fuse_current`
