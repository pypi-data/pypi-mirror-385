## Latest News
* 10/12/2025 [0.2.3](https://github.com/ModelCloud/PyPcre/releases/tag/v0.2.3): ü§ó Full `GIL=0` compliance for Python >= 3.13T. Reduced cache thread contention. Improved performance for all api. Expanded ci testing coverage. FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows compatibility validated.
* 10/09/2025 [0.1.0](https://github.com/ModelCloud/PyPcre/releases/tag/v0.1.0): üéâ First release. Thread safe, auto JIT, auto pattern caching and optimistic linking to system library for fast install.

## Why PyPcre:

PyPcre is a modern Pcre2 binding designed to be both super fast and thread-safe in the `GIL=0` world. In the old days of global interpreter locks, Python had real threads but mostly fake concurrency (with the exception of some low-level apis and packages). In 2025, Python is moving toward full `GIl=0` design which will unlock true multi-threaded concurrency and finally bring Python in parity with other modern languages. 

Many Python regular expression packages will either out-right segfault due to safety under `GIL=0` or suffer sub-optimal performance due to non-threaded design mindset. 

PyPcre is fully ci tested where every single api and Pcre2 flag is tested in a continuous development environment backed by the ModelCloud.AI team. Fuzz (clobber) tests are also performed to catch any memory safety, accuracy, or memory leak regressions. 

Safety first: PyPcre will optimistically link to the os provided `libpcre2` package for maximum safetey since PyPcre will automatically enjoy upstream security patches. You can force full source compile via `PYPCRE_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1` env toggle.

## Installation

```bash
pip install PyPcre
```

The package prioritizes linking against the `libpcre2-8` shared library in system for fast install and max security protection which gets latest patches from OS. See [Building](#building) for manual build details.

## Platform Support (Validated):

`Linux`, `MacOS`, `Windows`, `WSL`, `FreeBSD`, `Solaris`


## Usage


If you already rely on the standard library `re`, migrating is as
simple as changing your import:

```python
import pcre as re
```

The module-level entry points (`match`, `search`, `fullmatch`, `findall`,
`finditer`, `split`, `sub`, `subn`, `compile`, `escape`, `purge`) expose the
same call signatures as their `re` counterparts, making existing code work
unchanged. Every standard flag with a PCRE2 equivalent‚Äî`IGNORECASE`,
`MULTILINE`, `DOTALL`, `VERBOSE`, `ASCII`, and friends‚Äîis supported via the
re-exported constants and the `pcre.Flag` enum. 

### Sample Usage

```python
from pcre import match, search, findall, compile, Flag

if match(r"(?P<word>\\w+)", "hello world"):
    print("found word")

pattern = compile(rb"\d+", flags=Flag.MULTILINE)
numbers = pattern.findall(b"line 1\nline 22")
```

`pcre` mirrors the core helpers from Python‚Äôs standard library `re` module 
`match`, `search`, `fullmatch`, `finditer`, `findall`, and `compile` while
exposing PCRE2‚Äôs extended flag set through the Pythonic `Flag` enum
(`Flag.CASELESS`, `Flag.MULTILINE`, `Flag.UTF`, ...).

### Stdlib `re` compatibility

- Module-level helpers and the `Pattern` class follow the same call shapes as
  the standard library `re` module, including `pos`, `endpos`, and `flags`
  behaviour.
- `Pattern` mirrors `re.Pattern` attributes like `.pattern`, `.groupindex`,
  and `.groups`, while `Match` objects surface the familiar `.re`, `.string`,
  `.pos`, `.endpos`, `.lastindex`, `.lastgroup`, `.regs`, and `.expand()` API.
- Substitution helpers enforce the same type rules as the standard library
  `re` module: string patterns require string replacements, byte patterns
  require bytes-like replacements, and callable replacements receive the
  wrapped `Match`.
- `compile()` accepts native `Flag` values as well as compatible
  `re.RegexFlag` members from the standard library. Supported stdlib flags
  map 1:1 to PCRE2 options (`IGNORECASE‚ÜíCASELESS`, `MULTILINE‚ÜíMULTILINE`,
  `DOTALL‚ÜíDOTALL`, `VERBOSE‚ÜíEXTENDED`); passing unsupported stdlib flags
  raises a compatibility `ValueError` to prevent silent divergences.
- `pcre.escape()` delegates directly to `re.escape` for byte and text
  patterns so escaping semantics remain identical.

### `regex` package compatibility

The [`regex`](https://pypi.org/project/regex/) package interprets
`\uXXXX` and `\UXXXXXXXX` escapes as UTF-8 code points, while PCRE2 expects
hexadecimal escapes to use the `\x{...}` form. Enable `Flag.COMPAT_UNICODE_ESCAPE` to
translate those escapes automatically when compiling patterns:

```python
from pcre import compile, Flag

pattern = compile(r"\\U0001F600", flags=Flag.COMPAT_UNICODE_ESCAPE)
assert pattern.pattern == r"\\x{0001F600}"
```

Set the default behaviour globally with `pcre.configure(compat_regex=True)`
so that subsequent calls to `compile()` and the module-level helpers apply
the conversion without repeating the flag.

### Automatic pattern caching

`pcre.compile()` caches the final `Pattern` wrapper for up to 128
unique `(pattern, flags)` pairs when the pattern object is hashable. By default
the cache is **thread-local**, keeping per-thread LRU stores so workers do not
contend with one another. Adjust the capacity with `pcre.set_cache_limit(n)`‚Äîpass
`0` to disable caching completely or `None` for an unlimited cache‚Äîand check the
current limit with `pcre.get_cache_limit()`. The cache can be emptied at any time
with `pcre.clear_cache()`.

Applications that prefer the historic global cache can opt back in before any
compilation takes place by setting `PYPCRE_CACHE_PATTERN_GLOBAL=1` in the
environment **before importing** `pcre`. Runtime switching is no longer
supported; altering the value after patterns have been compiled raises
`RuntimeError`.

### Text versus bytes defaults

String patterns follow the same defaults as Python‚Äôs `re` module,
automatically enabling the `Flag.UTF` and `Flag.UCP` options so Unicode
pattern and character semantics ‚Äújust work.‚Äù Byte patterns remain raw by
default‚Äîneither option is activated‚Äîso you retain full control over
binary-oriented matching. Explicitly set `Flag.NO_UTF`/`Flag.NO_UCP` if you
need to opt out for strings, or add the UTF/UCP flags yourself when compiling
bytes.

### Working with compiled patterns

- `compile()` accepts either a pattern literal or an existing `Pattern`
  instance, making it easy to mix compiled objects with the convenience
  helpers.
- `Pattern.match/search/fullmatch/finditer/findall` accept optional
  `pos`, `endpos`, and `options` arguments, mirroring the standard library
  `re` module while letting you thread PCRE2 execution flags through
  individual calls.

### Threaded execution

- `pcre.parallel_map()` fans out work across a shared thread pool for
  `match`, `search`, `fullmatch`, and `findall`. The helper preserves the
  order of the provided subjects and returns the same result objects you‚Äôd
  normally receive from the `Pattern` methods.
- The threaded backend activates only on machines with at least eight CPU
  cores; otherwise execution falls back to the sequential path regardless of
  flags or configuration.
- Threading is **opt-in by default** when Python runs without the GIL
  (e.g. Python with `-X gil=0` or `PYTHON_GIL=0`). When the GIL is active the default falls
  back to sequential execution to avoid needless overhead.
- With auto threading enabled (`configure_threads(enabled=True)`), the pool
  is only engaged when at least one subject is larger than the configured
  threshold (60‚ÄØkB by default). Smaller jobs run sequentially to avoid the
  cost of thread hand-offs; adjust the boundary via
  `configure_threads(threshold=...)`.
- Use `Flag.THREADS` to force threaded execution for a specific pattern or
  `Flag.NO_THREADS` to lock it to sequential mode regardless of global
  settings.
- `pcre.configure_thread_pool(max_workers=...)` controls the size of the
  shared executor (capped to half the available CPUs); call it with
  `preload=True` to spin the pool up eagerly, and `shutdown_thread_pool()`
  to tear it down manually if needed.

### Performance considerations

- **Precompile for hot loops.** The module-level helpers mirror the `re`
  API and route through the shared compilation cache, but the extra call
  plumbing still adds overhead. With a simple pattern like `"fo"`, using
  the low-level `pcre_ext_c.Pattern` directly costs ~0.60‚ÄØ¬µs per call,
  whereas the high-level `pcre.match()` helper lands at ~4.4‚ÄØ¬µs per call
  under the same workload. For sustained loops, create a `Pattern` object
  once and reuse it.
- **Benchmark toggles.** The extension defaults to the fastest safe
  configuration, but you can flip individual knobs back to the legacy
  behaviour by setting environment variables *before* importing `pcre`:

  | Env var                        | Effect (per-call, `pattern.match("fo")`) |
  |--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
  | _(baseline)_                   | 0.60‚ÄØ¬µs                                  |
  | `PYPCRE_DISABLE_CONTEXT_CACHE=1` | 0.60‚ÄØ¬µs |
  | `PYPCRE_FORCE_JIT_LOCK=1`       | 0.60‚ÄØ¬µs |
  | `pcre.match()` helper          | 4.43‚ÄØ¬µs                                  |

  The toggles reintroduce the legacy GIL hand-off, per-call match-context
  allocation, and explicit locks so you can quantify the impact of each
  optimisation on your workload. Measurements were taken on CPython 3.14 (rc3)
  with 200‚ÄØ000 evaluations of `pcre_ext_c.compile("fo").match("foobar")`; absolute
  values will vary by platform, but the relative differences are
  representative. Leave the variables unset in production to keep the new fast
  paths active.

### JIT Pattern Compilation and Execution

Pcre2‚Äôs JIT compiler is enabled by default for every compiled pattern. The
wrapper exposes two complementary ways to adjust that behaviour:

- Toggle the global default at runtime with `pcre.configure(jit=False)` to
  turn JIT off (call `pcre.configure(jit=True)` to turn it back on).
- Override the default per pattern using the Python-only flags `Flag.JIT`
  and `Flag.NO_JIT`:

  ```python
  from pcre import compile, configure, Flag

  configure(jit=False)              # disable JIT globally
  baseline = compile(r"expr")      # JIT disabled

  fast = compile(r"expr", flags=Flag.JIT)      # force-enable for this pattern
  slow = compile(r"expr", flags=Flag.NO_JIT)   # force-disable for this pattern
  ```

## Pattern cache
- `pcre.compile()` caches hashable `(pattern, flags)` pairs, keeping up to 128 entries per thread by default.
- Set `PYPCRE_CACHE_PATTERN_GLOBAL=1` before importing `pcre` if you need a shared, process-wide cache instead of isolated thread stores.
- Use `pcre.clear_cache()` when you need to free the active cache proactively.
- Non-hashable pattern objects skip the cache and are compiled each time.

## Default flags for text patterns
- String patterns enable `Flag.UTF` and `Flag.UCP` automatically so behaviour matches `re`.
- Byte patterns keep both flags disabled; opt in manually if Unicode semantics are desired.
- Explicitly supply `Flag.NO_UTF`/`Flag.NO_UCP` to override the defaults for strings.

## Additional usage notes
- All top-level helpers (`match`, `search`, `fullmatch`, `finditer`, `findall`) defer to the cached compiler.
- Compiled `Pattern` objects expose `.pattern`, `.flags`, `.jit`, and `.groupindex` for introspection.
- Execution helpers accept `pos`, `endpos`, and `options`, allowing you to thread PCRE2 execution flags per call.

## Memory allocation
- By default PyPcre uses CPython's `PyMem` allocator.
- Override the allocator explicitly by setting `PYPCRE_ALLOCATOR` to one of
  `pymem`, `malloc`, `jemalloc`, or `tcmalloc` before importing the module. The
  optional allocators are still loaded with `dlopen`, so no additional link
  flags are required when they are absent.
- Call `pcre_ext_c.get_allocator()` to inspect which backend is active at
  runtime.

## Building

The extension links against an existing PCRE2 installation (the `libpcre2-8`
variant). Install the development headers for your platform before building,
for example `apt install libpcre2-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `dnf install pcre2-devel`
on Fedora/RHEL derivatives, or `brew install pcre2` on macOS.

If the headers or library live in a non-standard location you can export one
or more of the following environment variables prior to invoking the build
(`pip install .`, `python -m build`, etc.):

- `PYPCRE_ROOT`
- `PYPCRE_INCLUDE_DIR`
- `PYPCRE_LIBRARY_DIR`
- `PYPCRE_LIBRARY_PATH` *(pathsep-separated directories or explicit library files to
  prioritise when resolving `libpcre2-8`)*
- `PYPCRE_LIBRARIES`
- `PYPCRE_CFLAGS`
- `PYPCRE_LDFLAGS`

When `pkg-config` is available the build will automatically pick up the
required include and link flags via `pkg-config --cflags/--libs libpcre2-8`.
Without `pkg-config`, the build script scans common installation prefixes for
Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, openSUSE, Alpine),
FreeBSD, macOS (including Homebrew), and Solaris to locate the headers and
libraries.

If your system ships `libpcre2-8` under `/usr` but you also maintain a
manually built copy under `/usr/local`, export `PYPCRE_LIBRARY_PATH` (and, if
needed, a matching `PYPCRE_INCLUDE_DIR`) so the build links against the desired
location.
