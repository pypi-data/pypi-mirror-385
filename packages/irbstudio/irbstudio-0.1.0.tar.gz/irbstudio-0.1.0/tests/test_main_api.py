    Test run_analysis() with minimal parameters.
    
    This test verifies that the high-level run_analysis() function can:
    - Load a portfolio from a CSV file
    - Load configuration from a YAML file
    - Run the complete analysis workflow
    - Return results in the expected format

    - Calculate capital delta between scenarios
