    """
    Calculates the rating migration matrix from historical loan data.

    The migration matrix shows the probability of a loan transitioning from one
    rating to another over a single period.

    Args:
        data (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing loan-level data with at least
                             an ID, a date, and a rating column.
        id_col (str): The name of the column containing the unique loan identifier.
        date_col (str): The name of the column containing the observation date.
        rating_col (str): The name of the column containing the rating.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A square DataFrame where both the index and columns are the
                      unique ratings. Each cell (i, j) contains the probability
                      of migrating from rating i to rating j.
