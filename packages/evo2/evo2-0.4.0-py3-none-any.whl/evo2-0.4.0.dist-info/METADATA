              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

# Evo 2: Genome modeling and design across all domains of life

![Evo 2](evo2.jpg)

Evo 2 is a state of the art DNA language model for long context modeling and design. Evo 2 models DNA sequences at single-nucleotide resolution at up to 1 million base pair context length using the [StripedHyena 2](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna/blob/main/paper.pdf) architecture. Evo 2 was pretrained using [Savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna). Evo 2 was trained autoregressively on [OpenGenome2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/arcinstitute/opengenome2), a dataset containing 8.8 trillion tokens from all domains of life.

We describe Evo 2 in the preprint:
["Genome modeling and design across all domains of life with Evo 2"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.638918v1).

## Setup

This repo is for running Evo 2 locally for inference or generation, using our [Vortex](https://github.com/Zymrael/vortex) inference code. For training and finetuning, see the section [here](#training-and-finetuning).
You can run Evo 2 without any installation using the [Nvidia Hosted API](https://build.nvidia.com/arc/evo2-40b).
You can also self-host an instance using Nvidia NIM. See the [Nvidia NIM](#nvidia-nim) section for more 
information.

### Requirements

Evo 2 is built on the Vortex inference repo, see the [Vortex github](https://github.com/Zymrael/vortex) for more details and Docker option.

**Prerequisites**
- [Transformer Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) >= 2.0.0
- [Flash Attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main) for optimized attention operations (strongly recommended)

**System requirements**
- [OS] Linux (official) or WSL2 (limited support)
- [GPU] Requires Compute Capability 8.9+ (Ada/Hopper) for FP8 support
- [Software]
	- CUDA: 12.1+ with compatible NVIDIA drivers
	- cuDNN: 9.3+
	- Compiler: GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ with C++17 support
	- Python 3.12 required

**FP8 requirements:** The 40B and 1B models require FP8 for numerical accuracy, and low accuracy has been reported on Blackwell hardware or without FP8. The 7B models can run without FP8 by modifying the config. Always validate model outputs after configuration changes or on different hardware by using the tests.

Check respective githubs for more details about [Transformer Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) and [Flash Attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/tree/main) and how to install them.
We recommend using conda to easily install Transformer Engine. Here is an example of how to install the prerequisites:
```bash
conda install -c nvidia cuda-nvcc cuda-cudart-dev
conda install -c conda-forge transformer-engine-torch=2.3.0
pip install flash-attn==2.8.0.post2 --no-build-isolation
```

### Installation

To get started with Evo 2, install from pip or from github after installing the prerequisites.

To install Evo 2:
```bash
pip install evo2
```

For the latest features or to contribute:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arcinstitute/evo2
cd evo2
pip install -e .
```

To verify that the installation was correct:

```
python -m evo2.test.test_evo2_generation --model_name evo2_7b
```

For the 40b model:
```
python -m evo2.test.test_evo2_generation --model_name evo2_40b
```

### Docker

Evo 2 can be run using Docker (shown below), Singularity, or Apptainer.

```bash
docker build -t evo2 .
docker run -it --rm --gpus '"device=0"' -v ./huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface evo2 bash
```
Note: The volume mount (-v) preserves downloaded models between container runs and specifies where they are saved.

Once inside the container:

```bash
python -m evo2.test.test_evo2_generation --model_name evo2_7b
```

## Usage

### Checkpoints

We provide the following model checkpoints, hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/arcinstitute):
| Checkpoint Name                        | Description |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| `evo2_7b`  | 7B parameter model with 1M context |
| `evo2_40b`  | 40B parameter model with 1M context (requires multiple GPUs) |
| `evo2_7b_base`  | 7B parameter model with 8K context |
| `evo2_40b_base`  | 40B parameter model with 8K context |
| `evo2_1b_base`  | Smaller 1B parameter model with 8K context |
| `evo2_7b_262k`  | 7B parameter model with 262K context |
| `evo2_7b_microviridae`  | 7B parameter base model fine-tuned on Microviridae genomes |

**Note:** The 40B model requires multiple GPUs. Vortex automatically handles device placement, splitting the model across available CUDA devices.

### Forward

Evo 2 can be used to score the likelihoods across a DNA sequence.

```python
import torch
from evo2 import Evo2

evo2_model = Evo2('evo2_7b')

sequence = 'ACGT'
input_ids = torch.tensor(
    evo2_model.tokenizer.tokenize(sequence),
    dtype=torch.int,
).unsqueeze(0).to('cuda:0')

outputs, _ = evo2_model(input_ids)
logits = outputs[0]

print('Logits: ', logits)
print('Shape (batch, length, vocab): ', logits.shape)
```

### Embeddings

Evo 2 embeddings can be saved for use downstream. We find that intermediate embeddings work better than final embeddings, see our paper for details.

```python
import torch
from evo2 import Evo2

evo2_model = Evo2('evo2_7b')

sequence = 'ACGT'
input_ids = torch.tensor(
    evo2_model.tokenizer.tokenize(sequence),
    dtype=torch.int,
).unsqueeze(0).to('cuda:0')

layer_name = 'blocks.28.mlp.l3'

outputs, embeddings = evo2_model(input_ids, return_embeddings=True, layer_names=[layer_name])

print('Embeddings shape: ', embeddings[layer_name].shape)
```

### Generation

Evo 2 can generate DNA sequences based on prompts.

```python
from evo2 import Evo2

evo2_model = Evo2('evo2_7b')

output = evo2_model.generate(prompt_seqs=["ACGT"], n_tokens=400, temperature=1.0, top_k=4)

print(output.sequences[0])
```

## Notebooks

We provide example notebooks.

The [BRCA1 scoring notebook](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2/blob/main/notebooks/brca1/brca1_zero_shot_vep.ipynb) shows zero-shot *BRCA1* variant effect prediction. This example includes a walkthrough of:
- Performing zero-shot *BRCA1* variant effect predictions using Evo 2
- Reference vs alternative allele normalization

The [generation notebook](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2/blob/main/notebooks/generation/generation_notebook.ipynb) shows DNA sequence completion with Evo 2. This example shows:
- DNA prompt based generation and 'DNA autocompletion'
- How to get and prompt using phylogenetic species tags for generation

The [exon classifier notebook](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2/blob/main/notebooks/exon_classifier/exon_classifier.ipynb) demonstrates exon classification using Evo 2 embeddings. This example shows:
- Running the Evo 2 based exon classifier
- Performance metrics and visualization

The [sparse autoencoder (SAE) notebook](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2/blob/main/notebooks/sparse_autoencoder/sparse_autoencoder.ipynb) explores interpretable features learned by Evo 2. This example includes:
- Running and visualizing Evo 2 SAE features
- Demonstrating SAE features on a part of the *E. coli* genome


## Nvidia NIM

Evo 2 is available on [Nvidia NIM](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/containers?filters=&orderBy=scoreDESC&query=evo2&page=&pageSize=) and [hosted API](https://build.nvidia.com/arc/evo2-40b).

- [Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/bionemo/evo2/latest/overview.html)
- [Quickstart](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/bionemo/evo2/latest/quickstart-guide.html)

The quickstart guides users through running Evo 2 on the NVIDIA NIM using a python or shell client after starting NIM. An example python client script is shown below. This is the same way you would interact with the [Nvidia hosted API](https://build.nvidia.com/arc/evo2-40b?snippet_tab=Python).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
import os
import json
from pathlib import Path

key = os.getenv("NVCF_RUN_KEY") or input("Paste the Run Key: ")

r = requests.post(
    url=os.getenv("URL", "https://health.api.nvidia.com/v1/biology/arc/evo2-40b/generate"),
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {key}"},
    json={
        "sequence": "ACTGACTGACTGACTG",
        "num_tokens": 8,
        "top_k": 1,
        "enable_sampled_probs": True,
    },
)

if "application/json" in r.headers.get("Content-Type", ""):
    print(r, "Saving to output.json:\n", r.text[:200], "...")
    Path("output.json").write_text(r.text)
elif "application/zip" in r.headers.get("Content-Type", ""):
    print(r, "Saving large response to data.zip")
    Path("data.zip").write_bytes(r.content)
else:
    print(r, r.headers, r.content)
```


### Very long sequences

You can use [Savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna) or [Nvidia BioNemo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework) for embedding long sequences. Vortex can currently compute over very long sequences via teacher prompting, however please note that forward pass on long sequences may currently be slow.

## Dataset

The OpenGenome2 dataset used for pretraining Evo2 is available on [HuggingFace ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/arcinstitute/opengenome2). Data is available either as raw fastas or as JSONL files which include preprocessing and data augmentation.

## Training and Finetuning

Evo 2 was trained using [Savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna), an open source framework for training alternative architectures.

To train or finetune Evo 2, you can use [Savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna) or [Nvidia BioNemo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework) which provides a [Evo 2 finetuning tutorial here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/blob/ca16c2acf9bf813d020b6d1e2d4e1240cfef6a69/docs/docs/user-guide/examples/bionemo-evo2/fine-tuning-tutorial.ipynb).
