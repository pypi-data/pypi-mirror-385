### Quick Install (Recommended)

For most users, simply install the pre-built wheel:

```bash
pip install pyoctomap
```

**Supported Platforms:**
- Linux (manylinux2014 compatible)
- Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Pre-built wheels available for all supported combinations

> **🚀 ROS Integration**: ROS/ROS2 integration is currently being developed on the [`ros` branch](https://github.com/Spinkoo/pyoctomap/tree/ros), featuring ROS2 message support and real-time point cloud processing.

### Building from Source

> **📋 Prerequisites**: See [Build System Documentation](docs/build_system.md) for detailed system dependencies and troubleshooting guide.

If you need to build from source or create custom wheels, we provide a Docker-based build system:

**Linux / WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):**
```bash
# Clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Spinkoo/pyoctomap.git
cd pyoctomap

# Build and install OctoMap C++ library
cd src/octomap
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make && sudo make install

# Return to main project and run automated build script
cd ../../..
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

```bash
# Build wheels for all supported Python versions
./build-wheel.sh

# Or build manually with Docker
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.wheel -t pyoctomap-wheel .
```

The Docker build creates manylinux-compatible wheels for Python 3.9-3.14, properly bundling all required C++ libraries.

> **📋 Google Colab Users**: See [Build System Documentation](docs/build_system.md) for detailed Colab installation instructions.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import pyoctomap
import numpy as np

# Create an octree with 0.1m resolution
tree = pyoctomap.OcTree(0.1)

# Add occupied points
tree.updateNode([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], True)
tree.updateNode([1.1, 2.1, 3.1], True)

# Add free space
tree.updateNode([0.5, 0.5, 0.5], False)

# Check occupancy
node = tree.search([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
if node and tree.isNodeOccupied(node):
    print("Point is occupied!")

# Save to file
tree.write("my_map.bt")
```

### New Vectorized Operations

PyOctoMap now includes high-performance vectorized operations for better performance:

#### Traditional vs Vectorized Approach

**Traditional (slower):**
```python
# Individual point updates - slower
points = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [1.1, 2.1, 3.1], [1.2, 2.2, 3.2]])
for point in points:
    tree.updateNode(point, True)
```

**Vectorized (faster):**
```python
# Batch point updates - 4-5x faster
points = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [1.1, 2.1, 3.1], [1.2, 2.2, 3.2]])
tree.addPointsBatch(points)
```

#### Ray Casting with Free Space Marking

**Single Point with Ray Casting:**
```python
# Add point with automatic free space marking
sensor_origin = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.5])
point = np.array([2.0, 2.0, 1.0])
tree.addPointWithRayCasting(point, sensor_origin)
```

**Point Cloud with Ray Casting:**
```python
# Add point cloud with ray casting for each point
point_cloud = np.random.rand(1000, 3) * 10
sensor_origin = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.5])
success_count = tree.addPointCloudWithRayCasting(point_cloud, sensor_origin)
print(f"Added {success_count} points")
```

### Batch Operations

For efficient batch processing of point clouds, PyOctoMap provides both precise and fast options:

**Precise Batch Ray-Casting:**
```python
# Accurate batch insertion with ray-casting (hit-stopping for free/occupied)
points = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, (1000, 3))
origin = np.array([0., 0., 0.], dtype=np.float64)
success_count = tree.addPointCloudWithRayCasting(points, origin, discretize=True)
# discretize=True reduces duplicates for dense clouds
```

**Fast Native Batching:**
```python
# Fast C++ batch (full rays, optional discretization and lazy evaluation)
points = np.random.uniform(-5, 5, (1000, 3))
origin = np.array([0., 0., 0.], dtype=np.float64)
tree.insertPointCloudFast(points, origin, discretize=False, lazy_eval=True)
tree.updateInnerOccupancy()  # Manual after lazy

# Equivalent raw C++ access (identical to above)
tree.insertPointCloud(points, origin, discretize=False, lazy_eval=True)
tree.updateInnerOccupancy()
```

Note: `insertPointCloud` and `insertPointCloudFast` share the same underlying logic (consolidated for efficiency) – use either for native batching. For precision-critical tasks, prefer `addPointCloudWithRayCasting`; for speed, use natives with `lazy_eval=True` for deferral. All support NumPy arrays and `max_range` clipping.

### Performance Comparison

| Operation | Traditional | Vectorized | Speedup |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Individual points | 5,000 pts/sec | 20,000 pts/sec | 4x |
| Point cloud | 10,000 pts/sec | 30,000 pts/sec | 3x |
| Batch processing | 15,000 pts/sec | 60,000 pts/sec | 4x |

## Advanced Usage

### Room Mapping with Ray Casting

```python
import pyoctomap
import numpy as np

# Create octree
tree = pyoctomap.OcTree(0.05)  # 5cm resolution
sensor_origin = np.array([2.0, 2.0, 1.5])

# Add walls with ray casting
wall_points = []
for x in np.arange(0, 4.0, 0.05):
    for y in np.arange(0, 4.0, 0.05):
        wall_points.append([x, y, 0])  # Floor
        wall_points.append([x, y, 3.0])  # Ceiling

# Use vectorized approach for better performance
wall_points = np.array(wall_points)
tree.addPointCloudWithRayCasting(wall_points, sensor_origin)

print(f"Tree size: {tree.size()} nodes")
```

### Path Planning

```python
import pyoctomap
import numpy as np

# Create an octree for path planning
tree = pyoctomap.OcTree(0.1)  # 10cm resolution

# Add some obstacles to the map
obstacles = [
    [1.0, 1.0, 0.5],  # Wall at (1,1)
    [1.5, 1.5, 0.5],  # Another obstacle
    [2.0, 1.0, 0.5],  # Wall at (2,1)
]

for obstacle in obstacles:
    tree.updateNode(obstacle, True)

def is_path_clear(start, end, tree):
    """Efficient ray casting for path planning using OctoMap's built-in castRay"""
    start = np.array(start, dtype=np.float64)
    end = np.array(end, dtype=np.float64)
    
    # Calculate direction vector
    direction = end - start
    ray_length = np.linalg.norm(direction)
    
    if ray_length == 0:
        return True, None
    
    # Normalize direction
    direction = direction / ray_length
    
    # Use OctoMap's efficient castRay method
    end_point = np.zeros(3, dtype=np.float64)
    hit = tree.castRay(start, direction, end_point, 
                      ignoreUnknownCells=True, 
                      maxRange=ray_length)
    
    if hit:
        # Ray hit an obstacle - path is blocked
        return False, end_point
    else:
        # No obstacle found - path is clear
        return True, None

# Check if path is clear
start = [0.5, 2.0, 0.5]
end = [2.0, 2.0, 0.5]
clear, obstacle = is_path_clear(start, end, tree)
if clear:
    print("✅ Path is clear!")
else:
    print(f"❌ Path blocked at: {obstacle}")

# Advanced path planning with multiple waypoints
def plan_path(waypoints, tree):
    """Plan a path through multiple waypoints using ray casting"""
    path_clear = True
    obstacles = []
    
    for i in range(len(waypoints) - 1):
        start = waypoints[i]
        end = waypoints[i + 1]
        clear, obstacle = is_path_clear(start, end, tree)
        
        if not clear:
            path_clear = False
            obstacles.append((i, i+1, obstacle))
    
    return path_clear, obstacles

# Example: Plan path through multiple waypoints
waypoints = [
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.5],
    [1.0, 1.0, 0.5], 
    [2.0, 2.0, 0.5],
    [3.0, 3.0, 0.5]
]

path_clear, obstacles = plan_path(waypoints, tree)
if path_clear:
    print("✅ Complete path is clear!")
else:
    print(f"❌ Path blocked at segments: {obstacles}")
```

### Iterator Operations

PyOctoMap provides three types of iterators for different use cases:

#### Tree Iterator (`begin_tree`) - All Nodes
```python
# Iterate over ALL nodes (inner + leaf nodes) - slower but complete
for node_it in tree.begin_tree():
    coord = node_it.getCoordinate()
    depth = node_it.getDepth()
    size = node_it.getSize()
    is_leaf = node_it.isLeaf()
    
    # Use for: tree structure analysis, debugging, inner node operations
    if not is_leaf:
        print(f"Inner node at depth {depth}, size {size:.2f}m")
```

#### Leaf Iterator (`begin_leafs`) - Leaf Nodes Only  
```python
# Iterate over LEAF nodes only - faster for occupancy queries
for leaf_it in tree.begin_leafs():
    coord = leaf_it.getCoordinate()
    occupied = tree.isNodeOccupied(leaf_it)
    if occupied:
        print(f"Occupied leaf at {coord}")
    
    # Use for: standard occupancy operations, fast iteration
```

#### Bounding Box Iterator (`begin_leafs_bbx`) - Spatial Filtering
```python
# Iterate over leaf nodes within a bounding box
bbx_min = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
bbx_max = np.array([5.0, 5.0, 5.0])
for bbx_it in tree.begin_leafs_bbx(bbx_min, bbx_max):
    coord = bbx_it.getCoordinate()
    print(f"Node in BBX: {coord}")
    
    # Use for: region-specific analysis, spatial queries
```
