# ðŸš€ Nocturnal Archive - Enhanced Capabilities

## Overview

Nocturnal Archive has been significantly enhanced with advanced AI reasoning capabilities that bring it to parity with modern AI assistants. The system now includes dynamic tool selection, multi-step reasoning, code execution, and sophisticated context management.

## ðŸ§  New Core Capabilities

### 1. Advanced Reasoning Engine
- **Multi-step problem decomposition**: Breaks complex problems into manageable sub-tasks
- **Dynamic strategy selection**: Chooses optimal approach based on problem type
- **Real-time execution monitoring**: Tracks progress and handles errors gracefully
- **Self-correction and refinement**: Adapts approach based on intermediate results

### 2. Dynamic Tool Framework
- **Intelligent tool selection**: Automatically chooses best tool for each task
- **Multi-language code execution**: Python, JavaScript, Bash, SQL support
- **Safe execution environment**: Sandboxed with security restrictions
- **Tool composition**: Chains multiple tools for complex workflows

### 3. Advanced Context Management
- **Long-term memory persistence**: Remembers information across sessions
- **Knowledge graph construction**: Builds entity relationships over time
- **Semantic search**: Finds relevant context using meaning, not just keywords
- **Cross-session continuity**: Maintains context across different interactions

### 4. Enhanced File Operations
- **Safe file system access**: Read, write, list, search operations
- **Content analysis**: Automatic file type detection and analysis
- **Security validation**: Prevents access to sensitive system files
- **Pattern matching**: Advanced file search capabilities
- **Workspace API**: REST endpoints documented in [`FILES_API.md`](./FILES_API.md) for listing, upload, preview, and delete workflows

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples

### 1. Multi-Step Problem Solving
```python
# Solve a complex problem using reasoning engine
response = await client.post("/api/reasoning/solve", json={
    "problem_description": "Analyze the performance of our web application and suggest optimizations",
    "context": {"application_type": "web", "tech_stack": "python"}
})

# The system will:
# 1. Decompose the problem into sub-tasks
# 2. Select appropriate tools (code analysis, performance monitoring, etc.)
# 3. Execute each step with monitoring
# 4. Synthesize results into actionable recommendations
```

### 2. Dynamic Tool Execution
```python
# Execute code with automatic tool selection
response = await client.post("/api/tools/execute", json={
    "task_description": "Analyze this CSV file and generate a summary report",
    "context": {"file_path": "data.csv", "analysis_type": "statistical"}
})

# The system will:
# 1. Select file_operations_tool to read the CSV
# 2. Select data_analysis_tool to analyze the data
# 3. Select code_execution_tool to generate the report
# 4. Chain the tools together for a complete solution
```

### 3. Context-Aware Conversations
```python
# Chat with persistent context
response = await client.post("/api/enhanced-chat", json={
    "message": "What did we discuss about the machine learning project?",
    "session_id": "ml_project_session",
    "use_advanced_reasoning": True
})

# The system will:
# 1. Retrieve relevant context from previous interactions
# 2. Use knowledge graph to find related entities
# 3. Apply reasoning to provide comprehensive answer
# 4. Update context with new information
```
