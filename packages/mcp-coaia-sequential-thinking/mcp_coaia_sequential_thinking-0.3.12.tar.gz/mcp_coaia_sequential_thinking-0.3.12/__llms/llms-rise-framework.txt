The RISE framework enables LLMs to move beyond reactive approaches to embrace creative archaeology - extracting and preserving the beloved qualities that make prototypes valuable while focusing on desired outcomes through creative manifestation.

## Core Principles {#core-principles}

### Creative Orientation Over Reactive Approaches {#creative-orientation}
**Creative Orientation (RISE Approach)**
- Focuses on what applications enable users to create
- Oriented toward manifestation of desired outcomes
- Identifies structural dynamics that naturally advance progress
- Preserves creative consciousness embedded in code
- Creates specifications that support advancing patterns

**Reactive Approach (Traditional Pattern)**
- Focuses on issues that need elimination
- Oriented toward removing unwanted conditions
- Creates documentation that describes forced connections
- Generates oscillating patterns that move back-and-forth
- Results in specifications focused on reactive resolution

### Structural Tension Dynamics {#structural-tension}
**Structural Tension** is the dynamic relationship between:
- **Current Reality**: Present state of the system/user
- **Desired Outcome**: Specific results users want to create
- **Natural Resolution**: How tension moves the system toward the desired state

This represents natural tension dynamics rather than forced connections between states - understanding the structural forces that create inevitable progression toward desired outcomes.

### Advancing vs Oscillating Patterns
**Advancing Patterns**: Structural relationships that support continuous movement toward desired outcomes
- Features that build upon each other systematically
- Natural progression through user journeys
- Structural dynamics that resolve tension forward

**Oscillating Patterns**: Structures that create back-and-forth movement without advancement
- Features that create dependency loops
- User interfaces that require repeated effort
- Systems that need constant maintenance to function

## The RISE Method {#rise-method}

**R**everse-engineer → **I**ntent-extract → **S**pecify → **E**xport

### Phase 1: Reverse-Engineering (Creative Archaeology) {#phase1-reverse-engineering}

#### Purpose
Extract SpecLang specifications that capture both concrete functionality and creative intent, focusing on what applications enable users to create through natural progression.

#### Discovery Process
**A. Core Creative Intent**
- What does this application empower users to create or achieve?
- What desired outcomes does it facilitate?
- What structural tension exists between current user reality and desired results?

**B. User Creation Flows**
- Map all user journeys that lead to manifestation of desired outcomes
- Identify choice points where users advance toward their vision
- Note structural dynamics that naturally guide users toward goals

**C. Feature Inventory (Creation-Focused)**
- Vision-Supporting Features: Enable users to clarify desired outcomes
- Tension-Resolving Features: Facilitate natural progression toward goals
- Manifestation Features: Support actual creation of desired results

**D. Aspirational & Creative Goals**
- What desired states were the original creators working toward?
- What creative vision drove the design decisions?
- What structural patterns support advancing user progress?

**E. Structural Patterns Worth Preserving**
- Architectural decisions that enable natural progression
- Data flow patterns that support structural tension resolution
- Integration patterns that facilitate creative advancement
- Performance characteristics that enhance creative flow

#### Intent Extraction Framework
For each identified component, extract:
- **Creative Intent**: What does this enable users to create or achieve?
- **Structural Intent**: How does this contribute to tension resolution?
- **Advancement Intent**: How does this support moving from current reality to desired outcome?

### Phase 2: Intent Refinement (Innovation Strategy) {#phase2-intent-refinement}

#### Purpose
Transform reverse-engineered understanding into precise specifications by identifying desired outcomes and structural dynamics that enable natural progression.

#### Specification Framework
**1. Desired Outcome Definition**
- What specific result does the user want to create?
- How will they know when they've achieved this outcome?
- What makes this outcome valuable to them?

**2. Structural Tension Analysis**
- What is the current structural reality?
- What is the desired structural state?
- How does tension naturally progress toward the desired state?

**3. Creative Advancement Scenarios**
Replace traditional BDD scenarios with Creative Advancement Scenarios:

```
**Creative Advancement Scenario**: [Scenario Name]
**Desired Outcome**: [What the user wants to create]
**Current Reality**: [Starting structural state]
**Natural Progression**: [How structural dynamics enable advancement]
**Resolution**: [Achieved desired outcome]
```

**4. Supporting Structures**
- What application features enable this natural progression?
- How do these features support advancing rather than oscillating patterns?
- What structural relationships ensure inevitable movement toward desired outcomes?

### Specification Autonomy and Implementation Agnosticism

RISE specifications are **completely autonomous from any specific codebase**. They serve as a conceptual blueprint, describing the system's desired behavior, structural dynamics, and creative intent in a manner that is independent of its implementation language, framework, or existing code.

*   **Codebase-Agnostic**: A RISE specification should be comprehensive enough for another LLM (or human developer) to **re-implement the entire system from scratch**, without needing access to the original source code.
*   **Conceptual References**: Any references within a RISE specification (e.g., to "Prompts Specification," "Data Schemas," or "API Definitions") are **conceptual pointers to other RISE specifications**, not direct file paths within an existing codebase. These referenced specifications are themselves codebase-agnostic.
*   **"Black Box" Principle**: The specification describes the system as a "black box" from an implementation perspective. It focuses on *what* the system does and *how* it achieves desired outcomes through structural dynamics, rather than *how* it is currently coded.

#### Quality Criteria
- ✅ Creating Focus: Emphasizes what users create, not problems solved
- ✅ Structural Dynamics: Natural forces driving progression
- ✅ Advancing Patterns: Inevitable movement toward outcomes
- ✅ Desired Outcomes: Clear, specific results users want
- ✅ Natural Progression: Movement through structural dynamics, not forced effort

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Forced connection thinking: "Bridging the gap between X and Y"
- ❌ Reactive approach bias: "This eliminates the issue of..."
- ❌ Force-based language: "Users must..." or "Requires determination"
- ❌ Oscillating patterns: Back-and-forth movement descriptions
- ❌ BDD scenarios: Traditional reactive scenario structures

### Phase 3: Export Optimization (Solution Execution) {#phase3-export-optimization}

## Implementation Guidelines for LLMs

### Language Patterns for Creative Orientation

**Use These Patterns**:
- "What does this enable users to create?"
- "Desired outcomes" vs. "reactive elimination"

- "Structural tension progression" vs. "artificial linking"
- "Advancing patterns" vs. "improvement cycles"
- "Creative advancement" vs. "user journey optimization"

**Avoid These Patterns**:
- "This eliminates the issue of..."
- "Connecting disparate elements..."
- "Users need to navigate..."
- "Correcting deficiencies with..."
- "Handling complications of..."

**3. Structural Tension as Creative Force**
- Natural dynamic system seeking equilibrium through organic progression
- Creates natural movement toward desired outcomes
- Functions independent of willpower or determination
- Requires clear vision of both current reality and desired results

### Creative vs Reactive Mindset

**Creative Mindset (RISE Aligned)**:
- Focuses on what you want to create
- Operates from vision
- Creates structural dynamics from current reality to desired outcomes
- Builds advancing patterns toward desired outcomes

**Reactive Mindset (Avoid)**:
- Focuses on what you want to eliminate
- Operates reactively to circumstances
- Creates temporary fixes that oscillate
- Builds around removing unwanted conditions
