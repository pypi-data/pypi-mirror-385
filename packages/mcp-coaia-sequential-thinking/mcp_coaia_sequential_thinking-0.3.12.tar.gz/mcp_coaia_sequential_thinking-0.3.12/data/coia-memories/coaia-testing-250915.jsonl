Internal communication is direct. External (Gemini API) remains via `GeminiService`.\n- Agent Lifecycle: `EnhancedPolycentricLattice` manages persona lifecycle. `mia-gem-chat`'s `personas.ts` defines initial personas.\n- Implied Actions: Create `PolycentricCollaborationEngine.ts` wrapper, modify `App.tsx` to use it, implement MCP tool calls, ensure persona compatibility.\n\n**Phase 2: Advanced Orchestration & UI Integration (Frontend & Backend)**\n- Objective: Integrate `EnhancedPolycentricLattice`'s advanced orchestration (dynamic persona selection, tension management, consensus decision-making) into `mia-gem-chat` UI.\n- Data Flow: `CollaborationStatus` displays real-time metrics from `EnhancedPolycentricLattice`. UI interactions trigger `EnhancedPolycentricLattice` methods.\n- Communication: Real-time updates may require WebSockets or polling.\n- Implied Actions: Update `CollaborationStatus.tsx`, implement UI for dynamic persona selection, integrate `create_consensus_decision`.\n\n**Phase 3: Memory & Knowledge Base Integration**\n- Objective: Leverage `EnhancedPolycentricLattice`'s memory hierarchy and knowledge base mapping capabilities.\n- Data Flow: `EnhancedPolycentricLattice` manages multi-layered memory. Existing `EchoThreads` memory integrated as data sources/sinks.\n- Implied Actions: Develop data migration, implement 'Semantic Bridging Networks' and 'Conceptual Resonance Mapping', integrate memory tools.\n\n**Phase 4: Indigenous Methodologies & Generative Synesthesia Integration**\n- Objective: Embed Indigenous methodologies and generative synesthesia principles into agentic interactions and creative output.\n- Data Flow: Agent interactions guided by 'Sacred Knowledge Protocols' and 'Persona-Specific Analytical Lens Routing'.\n- Implied Actions: Develop 'Two-Eyed Seeing' implementations, integrate 'Ceremonial Pause Mechanisms' and 'Bias Navigation Layers', enhance generative output for 'Generative Synesthesia'."],"metadata":{"chartId":"chart_1757920628131","createdAt":"2025-09-15T07:17:08.131Z","updatedAt":"2025-09-15T07:33:25.520Z"}}
