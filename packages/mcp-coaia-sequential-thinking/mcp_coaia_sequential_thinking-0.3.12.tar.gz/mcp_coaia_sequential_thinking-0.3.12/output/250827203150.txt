In the larger context of "Introduction to Structural Thinking," which establishes that **the underlying structure of anything will determine its behavior**, one of the two distinct patterns of behavior that structure produces is **Resolving Advancing Structure**. This pattern represents an effective, outcome-oriented approach to creating sustainable change, contrasting sharply with the oscillating pattern we previously discussed.

Here's what the sources say about Resolving Advancing Structure:

*   **Definition and Outcome Orientation**: Instead of being a problem-oriented approach, a resolving advancing structure signifies an **outcome-oriented company or individual**. This means that the focus shifts from merely solving problems (which, as the sources note, "is not creating") to actively defining and pursuing desired outcomes. The process involves:
    *   Determining **"what are the outcomes that we want"**.
    *   Assessing **"where are we now in relationship to that"**.
    *   Establishing **"what's the best way to move from here to there"**.
    *   This "sounds simple...and it's not as simple as it sounds" because it requires **great clarity on both the desired outcome and the current reality**. It also necessitates an iterative learning process to continuously adapt the path as current reality changes, ensuring practicality and effectiveness.

*   **The Dynamic of Tension and Equilibrium**: This pattern is fundamentally driven by the concept of **tension**, which is not to be confused with stress, pressure, or anxiety. Instead, **tension is defined as "a structure of a contrast between a desired state and an actual state"**.
    *   This **difference creates a state of non-equilibrium**.
    *   Crucially, **"tension itself will seek equilibrium"**; it is described as a "dynamic" and a "force in play" that causes things to happen.
    *   In a proper creative process, the aim is to **"bring the current state up to the level of the a desired state and they become one of the same, they become equal"**. This movement from non-equilibrium to equilibrium is precisely what defines a resolving advancing kind of structure.
    *   This dynamic represents the **causal force** that drives change and achievement when structural thinking is applied correctly.

*   **Contrast with Problem-Solving**: The sources highlight a common pitfall: many companies organize themselves around problems, proudly calling themselves "dedicated problem solvers". However, even if you "get rid of all of your problems," you "still not have what you want" because **"problem solving is not creating; creating is not problem solving"**. Shifting to a resolving advancing structure means moving beyond a problem-driven mindset to a creative, outcome-driven one. An engineering company, initially problem-driven, is cited as a "good example" of successfully shifting to an outcome-oriented approach using this work.

In essence, a Resolving Advancing Structure is the desired behavioral pattern that emerges from a structure intentionally designed to move from a current state to a desired outcome. It leverages the natural dynamic of tension seeking equilibrium, ensuring that efforts lead to sustained achievement rather than the back-and-forth cycles seen in oscillation. This pattern underscores the importance of a fundamental "change of underlying structure" to achieve lasting, positive results.
