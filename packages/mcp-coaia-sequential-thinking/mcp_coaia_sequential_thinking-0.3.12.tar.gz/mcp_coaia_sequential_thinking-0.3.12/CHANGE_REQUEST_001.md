# CHANGE_REQUEST_001: Enable Agent Collaboration for Constitutional Principle Documentation

## 1. Problem Description

The `create_agent_collaboration` tool consistently fails to assign tasks to agents within the polycentric agentic lattice, even when agents are initialized and their capabilities appear to align with task requirements. This issue was observed during attempts to document constitutional principles (Scenario 1), where tasks would either immediately return "task not found" or transition to a "failed" status with no agents assigned. This prevents the effective utilization of the collaborative agent system for any multi-agent tasks.

## 2. Hypothesized Root Cause

The root cause is hypothesized to be an internal malfunction within the polycentric agentic lattice's task coordination and assignment mechanism. The system appears unable to effectively dequeue tasks, match them with available agents, and assign them, leading to tasks remaining unassigned despite agent availability. Potential issues include deadlocks, race conditions, or incorrect registration/discoverability of agents by the task assignment system.

## 3. Proposed Solution / Action Items for Implementation Agent

The implementation agent should investigate and rectify the task coordination and assignment module within the `mcp_coaia_sequential_thinking` package (specifically, within `mcp_coaia_sequential_thinking/polycentric_lattice.py` and related files).

**Specific areas of focus:**

*   **Task Dequeuing and Matching:** Analyze how tasks are retrieved from the pending queue and matched against available agent capabilities. Ensure efficient and accurate matching logic.
*   **Agent Assignment Mechanism:** Examine the process by which matched tasks are assigned to agents. Verify that agents correctly accept and begin processing tasks.
*   **Concurrency and Synchronization:** Investigate for potential deadlocks, race conditions, or other concurrency issues that might prevent task assignment in a multi-threaded or asynchronous environment.
*   **Agent Registration and Discoverability:** Confirm that agents, once initialized, are correctly registered with the task assignment system and are discoverable for task allocation.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Enhance logging within the task assignment process to provide more detailed insights into failures, including reasons for unassigned tasks.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

The `create_agent_collaboration` tool should successfully assign tasks to initialized agents with matching capabilities.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  Initialize the polycentric agentic lattice using `initialize_polycentric_lattice()`.
2.  Submit a `create_agent_collaboration` task with `description="Document constitutional principles"` and `required_capabilities=["information analysis", "structural analysis"]`.
3.  Verify, using `get_task_status(task_id)`, that the task transitions to an "in progress" or "completed" status and that the `assigned_agents` field is populated with the expected agents (e.g., "Constitutional Guardian", "Structural Analyst").
4.  Confirm that no "task not found" errors or immediate "failed" statuses occur for valid task submissions.
