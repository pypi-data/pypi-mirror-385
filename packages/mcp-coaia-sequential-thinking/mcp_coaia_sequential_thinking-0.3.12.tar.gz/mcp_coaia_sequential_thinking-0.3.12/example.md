## 1. Modifying Thinking Stages

You can customize the thinking stages by modifying the `ThoughtStage` enum in `models.py`:

```python
class ThoughtStage(Enum):
    """Custom thinking stages for your specific workflow."""
    OBSERVE = "Observe"
    HYPOTHESIZE = "Hypothesize"
    EXPERIMENT = "Experiment"
    ANALYZE = "Analyze"
    CONCLUDE = "Conclude"
```

## 2. Enhancing Thought Data Structure

Extend the `ThoughtData` class to include additional fields:

```python
from pydantic import Field, field_validator
class EnhancedThoughtData(ThoughtData):
    """Enhanced thought data with additional fields."""
    confidence_level: float = 0.0
    supporting_evidence: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    counter_arguments: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)

    @field_validator('confidence_level')
    def validate_confidence_level(cls, value):
        """Validate confidence level."""
        if not 0.0 <= value <= 1.0:
            raise ValueError("Confidence level must be between 0.0 and 1.0")
        return value
```

## 3. Adding Persistence with a Database

Implement a database-backed storage solution:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Float, Boolean, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship

Base = declarative_base()

class ThoughtModel(Base):
    """SQLAlchemy model for thought data."""
    __tablename__ = "thoughts"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    thought = Column(String, nullable=False)
    thought_number = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    total_thoughts = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    next_thought_needed = Column(Boolean, nullable=False)
    stage = Column(String, nullable=False)
    timestamp = Column(String, nullable=False)

    tags = relationship("TagModel", back_populates="thought")
    axioms = relationship("AxiomModel", back_populates="thought")
    assumptions = relationship("AssumptionModel", back_populates="thought")

class DatabaseStorage:
    """Database-backed storage for thought data."""

    def __init__(self, db_url: str = "sqlite:///thoughts.db"):
        """Initialize database connection."""
        self.engine = create_engine(db_url)
        Base.metadata.create_all(self.engine)
        self.Session = sessionmaker(bind=self.engine)

    def add_thought(self, thought: ThoughtData) -> None:
        """Add a thought to the database."""
        with self.Session() as session:
            # Convert ThoughtData to ThoughtModel
            thought_model = ThoughtModel(
                thought=thought.thought,
                thought_number=thought.thought_number,
                total_thoughts=thought.total_thoughts,
                next_thought_needed=thought.next_thought_needed,
                stage=thought.stage.value,
                timestamp=thought.timestamp
            )

            session.add(thought_model)
            session.commit()
```

## 4. Implementing Enhanced Analysis

Add more sophisticated analysis capabilities:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

class AdvancedAnalyzer:
    """Advanced thought analysis using NLP techniques."""

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the analyzer."""
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
        self.thought_vectors = None
        self.thoughts = []

    def add_thought(self, thought: ThoughtData) -> None:
        """Add a thought to the analyzer."""
        self.thoughts.append(thought)
        # Recompute vectors
        self._compute_vectors()

    def _compute_vectors(self) -> None:
        """Compute TF-IDF vectors for all thoughts."""
        if not self.thoughts:
            return

        thought_texts = [t.thought for t in self.thoughts]
        self.thought_vectors = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(thought_texts)

    def find_similar_thoughts(self, thought: ThoughtData, top_n: int = 3) -> List[Tuple[ThoughtData, float]]:
        """Find thoughts similar to the given thought using cosine similarity."""
        if thought not in self.thoughts:
            self.add_thought(thought)

        thought_idx = self.thoughts.index(thought)
        thought_vector = self.thought_vectors[thought_idx]

        # Compute similarities
        similarities = cosine_similarity(thought_vector, self.thought_vectors).flatten()

        # Get top N similar thoughts (excluding self)
        similar_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1][1:top_n+1]

        return [(self.thoughts[idx], similarities[idx]) for idx in similar_indices]
```

## 5. Creating Custom Prompts

Add custom prompts to guide the thinking process:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp.prompts import base

@mcp.prompt()
def problem_definition_prompt(problem_statement: str) -> list[base.Message]:
    """Create a prompt for the Problem Definition stage."""
    return [
        base.SystemMessage(
            "You are a structured thinking assistant helping to define a problem clearly."
        ),
        base.UserMessage(f"I need to define this problem: {problem_statement}"),
        base.UserMessage(
            "Please help me create a clear problem definition by addressing:\n"
            "1. What is the core issue?\n"
            "2. Who is affected?\n"
            "3. What are the boundaries of the problem?\n"
            "4. What would a solution look like?\n"
            "5. What constraints exist?"
        )
    ]

@mcp.prompt()
def research_prompt(problem_definition: str) -> list[base.Message]:
    """Create a prompt for the Research stage."""
    return [
        base.SystemMessage(
            "You are a research assistant helping to gather information about a problem."
        ),
        base.UserMessage(f"I've defined this problem: {problem_definition}"),
        base.UserMessage(
            "Please help me research this problem by:\n"
            "1. Identifying key information needed\n"
            "2. Suggesting reliable sources\n"
            "3. Outlining research questions\n"
            "4. Proposing a research plan"
        )
    ]
```

## 6. Advanced Configuration

Implement a configuration system for your server:

```python
import yaml
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

class ServerConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for the Sequential Thinking server."""
    server_name: str
    storage_type: str = "file"  # "file" or "database"
    storage_path: Optional[str] = None
    database_url: Optional[str] = None
    default_stages: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    max_thoughts_per_session: int = 100
    enable_advanced_analysis: bool = False

    @classmethod
    def from_yaml(cls, file_path: str) -> "ServerConfig":
        """Load configuration from a YAML file."""
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            config_data = yaml.safe_load(f)

        return cls(**config_data)

    def to_yaml(self, file_path: str) -> None:
        """Save configuration to a YAML file."""
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            yaml.dump(self.model_dump(), f)

# Usage
config = ServerConfig.from_yaml("config.yaml")

# Initialize storage based on configuration
if config.storage_type == "file":
    storage = ThoughtStorage(config.storage_path)
else:
    storage = DatabaseStorage(config.database_url)
```

## 7. Web UI Integration

Create a simple web UI for your server:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title="Sequential Thinking UI")

# Enable CORS
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

class ThoughtRequest(BaseModel):
    """Request model for adding a thought."""
    thought: str
    thought_number: int
    total_thoughts: int
    next_thought_needed: bool
    stage: str
    tags: List[str] = []
    axioms_used: List[str] = []
    assumptions_challenged: List[str] = []

@app.post("/thoughts/")
async def add_thought(request: ThoughtRequest):
    """Add a new thought."""
    try:
        # Convert stage string to enum
        thought_stage = ThoughtStage.from_string(request.stage)

        # Create thought data
        thought_data = ThoughtData(
            thought=request.thought,
            thought_number=request.thought_number,
            total_thoughts=request.total_thoughts,
            next_thought_needed=request.next_thought_needed,
            stage=thought_stage,
            tags=request.tags,
            axioms_used=request.axioms_used,
            assumptions_challenged=request.assumptions_challenged
        )

        # Store thought
        storage.add_thought(thought_data)

        # Analyze the thought
        all_thoughts = storage.get_all_thoughts()
        analysis = ThoughtAnalyzer.analyze_thought(thought_data, all_thoughts)

        return analysis
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/thoughts/")
async def get_thoughts():
    """Get all thoughts."""
    all_thoughts = storage.get_all_thoughts()
    return {
        "thoughts": [t.to_dict() for t in all_thoughts]
    }

@app.get("/summary/")
async def get_summary():
    """Get a summary of the thinking process."""
    all_thoughts = storage.get_all_thoughts()
    return ThoughtAnalyzer.generate_summary(all_thoughts)
```

## 8. Visualization Tools

Add visualization capabilities to your server:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import io
import base64
from typing import List, Dict, Any

class ThoughtVisualizer:
    """Visualization tools for thought data."""

    @staticmethod
    def create_stage_distribution_chart(thoughts: List[ThoughtData]) -> str:
        """Create a pie chart showing distribution of thoughts by stage."""
        # Count thoughts by stage
        stage_counts = {}
        for thought in thoughts:
            stage = thought.stage.value
            if stage not in stage_counts:
                stage_counts[stage] = 0
            stage_counts[stage] += 1

        # Create pie chart
        plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
        plt.pie(
            stage_counts.values(),
            labels=stage_counts.keys(),
            autopct='%1.1f%%',
            startangle=90
        )
        plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle
        plt.title('Thought Distribution by Stage')

        # Convert plot to base64 string
        buf = io.BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buf, format='png')
        buf.seek(0)
        img_str = base64.b64encode(buf.read()).decode('utf-8')
        plt.close()

        return f"data:image/png;base64,{img_str}"

    @staticmethod
    def create_thinking_timeline(thoughts: List[ThoughtData]) -> str:
        """Create a timeline visualization of the thinking process."""
        # Sort thoughts by number
        sorted_thoughts = sorted(thoughts, key=lambda t: t.thought_number)

        # Create stage colors
        stages = list(ThoughtStage)
        colors = plt.cm.viridis(np.linspace(0, 1, len(stages)))
        stage_colors = {stage.value: colors[i] for i, stage in enumerate(stages)}

        # Create timeline
        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

        for i, thought in enumerate(sorted_thoughts):
            plt.scatter(
                thought.thought_number,
                0,
                s=100,
                color=stage_colors[thought.stage.value],
                label=thought.stage.value if i == 0 or thought.stage != sorted_thoughts[i-1].stage else ""
            )

            # Add connecting lines
            if i > 0:
                plt.plot(
                    [sorted_thoughts[i-1].thought_number, thought.thought_number],
                    [0, 0],
                    'k-',
                    alpha=0.3
                )

        # Remove duplicate legend entries
        handles, labels = plt.gca().get_legend_handles_labels()
        by_label = dict(zip(labels, handles))
        plt.legend(by_label.values(), by_label.keys(), title="Thinking Stages")

        plt.title('Thinking Process Timeline')
        plt.xlabel('Thought Number')
        plt.yticks([])
        plt.grid(axis='x', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)

        # Convert plot to base64 string
        buf = io.BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buf, format='png')
        buf.seek(0)
        img_str = base64.b64encode(buf.read()).decode('utf-8')
        plt.close()

        return f"data:image/png;base64,{img_str}"
```

## 9. Integration with External Tools

Connect your server to external tools and APIs:

```python
import requests
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional

class ExternalToolsIntegration:
    """Integration with external tools and APIs."""

    def __init__(self, api_key: Optional[str] = None):
        """Initialize with optional API key."""
        self.api_key = api_key

    def search_research_papers(self, query: str, limit: int = 5) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Search for research papers related to a query."""
        # Example using Semantic Scholar API
        url = f"https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search"
        params = {
            "query": query,
            "limit": limit,
            "fields": "title,authors,year,abstract,url"
        }

        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()

        data = response.json()
        return data.get("data", [])

    def generate_mind_map(self, central_topic: str, related_topics: List[str]) -> str:
        """Generate a mind map visualization."""
        # This is a placeholder - in a real implementation, you might use
        # a mind mapping API or library to generate the visualization
        pass

    def export_to_notion(self, thoughts: List[ThoughtData], database_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Export thoughts to a Notion database."""
        if not self.api_key:
            raise ValueError("API key required for Notion integration")

        # Example using Notion API
        url = "https://api.notion.com/v1/pages"
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"
        }

        results = []

                                    "content": thought.thought
                                }
                            }
                        ]

            results.append(response.json())

        return {"exported": len(results), "results": results}
```

## 10. Collaborative Thinking

Implement collaborative features for team thinking:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Set
from datetime import datetime
import uuid

class User(BaseModel):
    """User information."""
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str

class Comment(BaseModel):
    """Comment on a thought."""
    id: str
    user_id: str
    content: str
    timestamp: str

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, user_id: str, content: str) -> 'Comment':
        """Create a new comment."""
        return cls(
            id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            user_id=user_id,
            content=content,
            timestamp=datetime.now().isoformat()
        )

class CollaborativeThoughtData(ThoughtData):
    """Thought data with collaborative features."""
    created_by: str
    last_modified_by: str
    comments: List[Comment] = Field(default_factory=list)
    upvotes: Set[str] = Field(default_factory=set)

    def add_comment(self, user_id: str, content: str) -> Comment:
        """Add a comment to the thought."""
        comment = Comment.create(user_id, content)
        self.comments.append(comment)
        return comment

    def toggle_upvote(self, user_id: str) -> bool:
        """Toggle upvote for a user."""
        if user_id in self.upvotes:
            self.upvotes.remove(user_id)
            return False
        else:
            self.upvotes.add(user_id)
            return True

class CollaborativeSession(BaseModel):
    """Session for collaborative thinking."""
    id: str
    name: str
    created_by: str
    participants: Dict[str, User] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    thoughts: List[CollaborativeThoughtData] = Field(default_factory=list)

    def add_participant(self, user: User) -> None:
        """Add a participant to the session."""
        self.participants[user.id] = user

    def add_thought(self, thought: CollaborativeThoughtData) -> None:
        """Add a thought to the session."""
        self.thoughts.append(thought)
```

## 11. Separating Test Code

Separate test-specific code from production code for better organization:

```python
# mcp_sequential_thinking/testing.py
"""Test utilities for the sequential thinking package.

This module contains utilities and helpers specifically designed to support testing.
By separating test-specific code from production code, we maintain cleaner separation
of concerns and avoid test-specific logic in production paths.
"""

from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from .models import ThoughtData, ThoughtStage


class TestHelpers:
    """Utilities for testing the sequential thinking components."""

    @staticmethod
