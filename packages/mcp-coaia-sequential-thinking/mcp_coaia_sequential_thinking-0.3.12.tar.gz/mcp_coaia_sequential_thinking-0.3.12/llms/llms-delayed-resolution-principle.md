# Delayed Resolution Principle in COAIA Memory

## Core Philosophy: Tolerate Discrepancy, Tension, and Delayed Resolution

Based on Robert Fritz's structural tension methodology, the COAIA Memory system must **hold tension** rather than prematurely resolve it. This is fundamental to maintaining the creative advancing pattern.

### The Problem with Premature Resolution

When creating structural tension charts, LLMs often jump to "solving" the tension by providing default values that eliminate the discrepancy between current reality and desired outcome. This **destroys the structural tension** that drives creative advancement.

**Current Problematic Code:**
```typescript
// This PREMATURELY RESOLVES tension
const actionCurrentReality = currentReality || `Ready to begin: ${actionStepTitle}`;
```

**Why This Violates Fritz's Principle:**
- Creates artificial readiness where none exists
- Eliminates the productive tension needed for advancement
- Makes assumptions about user's actual current reality
- Removes the generative force of structural tension

### Fritz's Teaching on Delayed Resolution

From "The Secret of Professional Creators":

> "The secret is tolerate discrepancy, tension, and delayed resolution... our minds want instant resolution to any situation in which there's some type of contrast or difference... But in life and in the creative process, there are times when we don't want to prematurely resolve tension. We want to build it."

### Application to Current Reality Defaults

**WRONG Approach - Premature Resolution:**
- "Ready to begin: [action]"
- "Starting work on [action]"
- "Prepared to tackle [action]"

**CORRECT Approach - Maintaining Tension:**
- Require explicit current reality assessment
- Use tension-holding placeholders when needed
- Extract actual reality from user context

### Guidelines for LLMs Working with COAIA Memory

#### When Creating Charts:
1. **NEVER** assume readiness or preparation
2. **ALWAYS** assess actual current reality from user input
3. **HOLD TENSION** until proper assessment is made
4. **ASK** for current reality clarification if unclear

#### When Telescoping Action Steps:
1. Each action step becomes its own structural tension chart
2. Current reality for action step â‰  readiness to begin
3. Must assess actual current state relative to that specific action
4. Maintain tension at every level of the hierarchy

#### Common LLM Mistakes to Avoid:
- Defaulting to "ready to begin" language
- Assuming user preparation without evidence
- Creating false equilibrium through premature resolution
- Using gap-thinking language ("bridge the gap", "fill the void")

### The Natural Resolution Process

Structural tension resolves naturally through:
1. **Clear desired outcome** (what you want to create)
2. **Honest current reality** (where you actually are)
3. **Strategic action steps** (intermediary results)
4. **Completion flowing into reality** (advancement changes the structure)

The system seeks equilibrium through **advancement**, not through **assumption** or **premature closure**.

### Implementation Requirements

For COAIA Memory to maintain creative orientation:
1. **No default current reality** - require explicit assessment
2. **Tension-aware prompting** - guide users to honest current reality
3. **Context extraction** - derive reality from user's actual situation
4. **Placeholder tension** - if default needed, maintain productive discrepancy

Remember: **Structure determines behavior**. Premature resolution creates oscillating patterns. Proper structural tension creates advancing patterns.
