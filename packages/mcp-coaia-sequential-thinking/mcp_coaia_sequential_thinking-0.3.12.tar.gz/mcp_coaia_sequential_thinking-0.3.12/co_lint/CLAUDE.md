Notes on PREVENTING miadisabelle/mcp-knowledge-graph#5

(NOTE: Claude used "PREVENTS" which in itself, this whole usage of words like that makes it scary and potentially dangerous, we are not preventing anything, we are creating a natural system that wants to be in equilibrium, therefore, we volontarily create the desequilibrium. Saying we prevent 'oscillation' is like saying that problem-solving doesn't have its place, it does, it is just not creating....Also, the addition of 'genuine' is useless and does not add any values, it is just fluff, question yourself: 'is there a forward momentum that is not genuine?')

POTENTIAL RESULTS: A sets of rules for 'co-lint'
