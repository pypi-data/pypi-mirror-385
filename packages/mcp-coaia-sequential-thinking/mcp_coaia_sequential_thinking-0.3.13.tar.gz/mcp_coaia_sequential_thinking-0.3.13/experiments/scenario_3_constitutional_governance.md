# Scenario 3: Constitutional Decision Making & Agent Collaboration

**Goal:** To test the constitutional governance framework and demonstrate how agents collaborate to make principle-based decisions, ensuring constitutional compliance and maintaining audit trails.

**Scenario Context:** "A critical architectural decision needs to be made about data storage strategy for sensitive customer information, involving trade-offs between performance, security, privacy, and cost."

**Constitutional Principles at Stake:**
- Privacy protection
- Security-first design
- Performance optimization
- Cost-effectiveness
- Transparency in decision-making

## Steps:

1. **Check Agent Creative Orientation:** Ensure agents are in proper creative orientation before making critical decisions.
   - **Tool:** `check_agent_creative_orientation`
   - **Arguments:**
     - `content`: "We need to make a data storage architecture decision for sensitive customer information."
     - `context`: {"decision_type": "architectural", "sensitivity": "high", "stakeholders": ["customers", "engineering", "security", "finance"]}

2. **Create Consensus Decision:** Initiate a constitutional decision-making process.
   - **Tool:** `create_consensus_decision`
   - **Arguments:**
     - `decision_type`: "architectural_choice"
     - `primary_purpose`: "Select optimal data storage strategy balancing security, performance, and cost."
     - `proposal`: "Evaluate three options: 1) High-security encrypted database with moderate performance, 2) Performance-optimized solution with standard security, 3) Hybrid approach with tiered storage based on sensitivity."
     - `current_reality`: "Current system has performance bottlenecks and security gaps with customer data."
     - `desired_outcome`: "Secure, performant, cost-effective storage solution that protects customer privacy."
     - `participating_agents`: ["constitutional_guardian", "structural_analyst", "mia", "miette", "haiku"]

3. **Submit Agent Task for Constitutional Review:** Have specialized agents review constitutional compliance.
   - **Tool:** `submit_agent_task`
   - **Arguments:**
     - `description`: "Review data storage options for constitutional compliance with privacy and security principles."
     - `requirements`: ["constitutional_analysis", "privacy_assessment", "security_evaluation"]
     - `task_type`: "constitutional_review"
     - `priority`: "high"

4. **Create Agent Collaboration:** Facilitate collaboration between technical and governance agents.
   - **Tool:** `create_agent_collaboration`
   - **Arguments:**
     - `description`: "Collaborative analysis of data storage architectural decision with constitutional oversight."
     - `required_capabilities`: ["architectural_design", "constitutional_compliance", "privacy_analysis", "performance_optimization"]
     - `target_agents`: ["structural_analyst", "constitutional_guardian"]

5. **Validate Constitutional Compliance:** Ensure the decision process follows constitutional principles.
   - **Tool:** `validate_constitutional_compliance`
   - **Arguments:**
     - `content`: "Final recommendation for hybrid tiered storage approach with encryption levels based on data sensitivity."
     - `context`: {"decision_stage": "final_recommendation", "agents_involved": ["constitutional_guardian", "structural_analyst"], "principles_considered": ["privacy", "security", "transparency"]}

6. **Get Constitutional Audit Trail:** Retrieve complete audit trail for transparency and accountability.
   - **Tool:** `get_constitutional_audit_trail`
   - **Arguments:**
     - `decision_id`: (from consensus decision step)

## Expected Outcome:

- **Agent Orientation Assessment:** Confirmation that agents are in creative (not reactive) orientation for decision-making.
- **Constitutional Consensus:** A decision that complies with all constitutional principles while balancing competing requirements.
- **Agent Collaboration Results:** Evidence of effective multi-agent collaboration with constitutional oversight.
- **Constitutional Validation:** Confirmation that the decision process and outcome align with system principles.
- **Complete Audit Trail:** Transparent record of decision-making process, principle applications, and agent contributions.
- **Governance Effectiveness:** Demonstration that constitutional governance prevents reactive decision-making while enabling principled choices.

## Success Metrics:

1. **Constitutional Compliance Score:** â‰¥ 0.85
2. **Agent Collaboration Quality:** Evidence of meaningful multi-perspective input
3. **Audit Trail Completeness:** Full traceability of decision process
4. **Creative Orientation Maintenance:** No reactive problem-solving bias detected
5. **Stakeholder Balance:** All stakeholder interests (customers, engineering, security, finance) represented in final decision
