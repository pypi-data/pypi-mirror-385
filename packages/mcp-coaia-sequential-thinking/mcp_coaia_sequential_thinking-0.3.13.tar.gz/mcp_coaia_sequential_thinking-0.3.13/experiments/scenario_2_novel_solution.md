# Scenario 2: Novel Solution Discovery & Goal Integration

**Goal:** To demonstrate how to use the novelty search capabilities to discover innovative solutions and then integrate them into existing system goals, maintaining a resilient connection between exploration and exploitation.

**Existing Goal:** "Achieve 99.9% uptime for the core microservice by end of Q4."

**Context for Novelty Search:** "We are looking for innovative approaches to improve microservice reliability beyond traditional redundancy and load balancing."

## Steps:

1.  **Establish System Goal:** Define an existing goal within the resilient connection system.
    *   **Tool:** `establish_system_goal`
    *   **Arguments:**
        *   `description`: "Achieve 99.9% uptime for the core microservice by end of Q4."
        *   `priority`: 0.9
        *   `target_completion_days`: 90

2.  **Conduct Novelty Search:** Explore for innovative solutions that are distinct from known approaches.
    *   **Tool:** `conduct_novelty_search`
    *   **Arguments:**
        *   `context`: `{"microservice_name": "core_service", "current_reliability_measures": ["redundancy", "load_balancing"]}`
        *   `current_solutions`: `["traditional redundancy", "standard load balancing"]`
        *   `target_novelty`: 0.8 (seeking highly novel solutions)

3.  **Discover Emergent Opportunities (Optional but Recommended):** Broaden the search for any unexpected opportunities.
    *   **Tool:** `discover_emergent_opportunities`
    *   **Arguments:**
        *   `exploration_context`: `{"domain": "microservice_architecture", "focus": "reliability_engineering"}`

4.  **Evaluate Resilient Connection:** Assess the current balance between goal-directed action and exploration, and get recommendations.
    *   **Tool:** `evaluate_resilient_connection`

5.  **Integrate Emergent Possibility:** Select a discovered novel solution (emergent possibility) and integrate it into the existing goal.
    *   **Tool:** `integrate_emergent_possibility`
    *   **Arguments:**
        *   `possibility_id`: (ID of a novel solution discovered in step 2 or 3)
        *   `integration_strategy`: "enhancement" (to enhance the existing goal) or "new_goal" (if the discovery warrants a new, separate goal).

6.  **Get Goal Progress:** Verify how the goal has been updated after integration.
    *   **Tool:** `get_goal_progress`
    *   **Arguments:**
        *   `goal_id`: (ID of the goal established in step 1)

## Expected Outcome:

*   A `goal_id` for the established system goal.
*   A list of `novel_solutions` with their `novelty_score` and `constitutional_compliance`.
*   Potentially, additional `emergent_opportunities` discovered.
*   An evaluation of the resilient connection, including recommendations for balance adjustment.
*   The chosen novel solution successfully integrated into the existing goal, either enhancing it or creating a new goal.
*   Updated goal progress reflecting the integration.
