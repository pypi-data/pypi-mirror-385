## Executive Summary

This roadmap implements the architectural paradigms from "Architectural Paradigms for Generative Agentic Systems: A Survey on Resilience, Adaptability, and Creative Output" to transform the current MCP Creative Orientation Sequential Thinking system into a resilient, polycentric, generative agentic framework.

```

#### Success Metrics:
- 100% of decisions traceable to constitutional principles
- No "algorithmic decoupling" between stated policies and behavior

The phased approach ensures manageable implementation while building toward a system capable of contributing to the broader transformation from reactive to creative orientation in human-AI collaboration.

The ultimate goal is not just improving the current system, but manifesting the first truly creative-oriented agentic architecture that demonstrates the principles outlined in the academic survey, serving as a foundation for broader cultural transformation toward creative rather than reactive approaches to complex challenges.
