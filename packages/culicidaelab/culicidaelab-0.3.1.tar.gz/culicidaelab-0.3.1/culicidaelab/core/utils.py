    """
    Downloads a file from the specified URL showing a progress bar and optionally calling
    a progress callback function. Supports both direct destination paths and default
    download directories.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the file to download. Must start with 'http://' or 'https://'.
        destination (Union[str, Path, None], optional): The complete file path where the
            downloaded file should be saved. If None, the file will be saved in downloads_dir
            with its original filename. Defaults to None.
        downloads_dir (Union[str, Path, None], optional): The directory to save the file in
            when no specific destination is provided. If None, uses current working directory.
            Defaults to None.
        progress_callback (Optional[Callable[[int, int], None]], optional): A function to call
            with progress updates. Takes two parameters: bytes downloaded and total bytes.
            Defaults to None.
        chunk_size (int, optional): Size of chunks to download in bytes. Larger chunks use
            more memory but may download faster. Defaults to 8192.
        timeout (int, optional): Number of seconds to wait for server response before timing
            out. Defaults to 30.
        desc (Optional[str], optional): Custom description for the progress bar. If None,
            uses the filename. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Path: Path object pointing to the downloaded file.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the URL is invalid or doesn't start with http(s).
        RuntimeError: If the download fails due to network issues or if writing the file
            fails due to permission or disk space issues.

    Example:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> # Basic download to current directory
        >>> path = download_file('https://example.com/data.csv')
        >>> print(path)
        PosixPath('data.csv')

        ...     destination='downloads/myfile.zip',

    """
    Sanitize a string to create a safe directory or file name.

    Converts a string into a valid filename by replacing Windows/Unix reserved characters
    with underscores and removing potentially problematic leading/trailing characters.
    If the resulting string is empty, returns a UUID.

    Args:
        name (str): The string to be converted into a safe filename. If not a string,
            it will be converted to one.

    Returns:
        str: A sanitized string safe for use as a filename or directory name.
            - Reserved characters (<>:\"/\\|?*) are replaced with underscores
            - Leading/trailing dots and whitespace are removed
            - If result would be empty, returns a UUID

    Example:
        >>> # Basic filename sanitization
        >>> create_safe_path('my:file*.txt')
