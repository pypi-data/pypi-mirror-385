"""Service for managing data provider instances.

This module provides `ProviderService`, which is responsible for instantiating,
caching, and providing access to provider instances like `HuggingFaceProvider`.

Example:
    >>> from culicidaelab.core.settings import Settings
    >>> from culicidaelab.core.provider_service import ProviderService
    >>> settings = Settings()
    >>> provider_service = ProviderService(settings)
    >>> hf_provider = provider_service.get_provider("huggingface")
