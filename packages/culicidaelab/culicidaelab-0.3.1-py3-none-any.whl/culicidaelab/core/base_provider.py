"""Base provider class that all data providers inherit from.

This module defines the `BaseProvider` abstract base class, which establishes an
interface for classes responsible for downloading datasets and model weights
from various sources (e.g., Hugging Face).

Example:
    >>> from culicidaelab.providers.huggingface_provider import HuggingFaceProvider
    >>> provider = HuggingFaceProvider()
    >>> dataset_path = provider.download_dataset("user/my-dataset")
    >>> print(dataset_path)
