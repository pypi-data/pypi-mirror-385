# Ultra Zoom

A fast single image super-resolution (SISR) model for upscaling images without loss of detail. Ultra Zoom uses a two-stage "zoom in and enhance" strategy that uses a fast deterministic upscaling algorithm to zoom in and then enhances the image through a residual pathway that operates primarily in the low-resolution subspace of a deep neural network. As such, Ultra Zoom requires less resources than upscalers that predict every new pixel de novo - making it outstanding for real-time image processing.

## Key Features

- **Fast and scalable**: Instead of predicting the individual pixels of the upscaled image, Ultra Zoom uses a unique "zoom in and enhance" approach that combines the speed of deterministic bicubic interpolation with the power of a deep neural network.

- **Full RGB**: Unlike many efficient SR models that only operate in the luminance domain, Ultra Zoom operates within the full RGB color domain enhancing both luminance and chrominance for the best possible quality.

- **Denoising and Deblurring**: During the enhancement stage, the model removes multiple types of noise and blur making images look crisp and clean.

## Pretrained Models

The following pretrained models are available on HuggingFace Hub.

| Name | Zoom | Num Channels | Hidden Ratio | Encoder Layers | Total Parameters |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [andrewdalpino/UltraZoom-2X](https://huggingface.co/andrewdalpino/UltraZoom-2X) | 2X | 48 | 2X | 20 | 1.8M |
| [andrewdalpino/UltraZoom-3X](https://huggingface.co/andrewdalpino/UltraZoom-3X) | 3X | 54 | 2X | 30 | 3.5M |
| [andrewdalpino/UltraZoom-4X](https://huggingface.co/andrewdalpino/UltraZoom-4X) | 4X | 96 | 2X | 40 | 14M |

## Pretrained Example

If you'd just like to load the pretrained weights and do inference, getting started is as simple as in the example below. First, you'll need the `ultrazoom` and `torchvision` Python packages installed into your project.

```sh
pip install ultrazoom torchvision
```

Next, load the model weights from HuggingFace Hub and feed the network some images. Note that the input to the `upscale()` method is a normalized [0, 1] 4D tensor of shape [b, 3, w, h] where b is the batch dimension, and w and height are the width and height respectively.

```python
import torch

from torchvision.io import decode_image, ImageReadMode
from torchvision.transforms.v2 import ToDtype, ToPILImage

from ultrazoom.model import UltraZoom


model_name = "andrewdalpino/UltraZoom-2X"
image_path = "./dataset/bird.png"

model = UltraZoom.from_pretrained(model_name)

image_to_tensor = ToDtype(torch.float32, scale=True)
tensor_to_pil = ToPILImage()

image = decode_image(image_path, mode=ImageReadMode.RGB)

x = image_to_tensor(image).unsqueeze(0)

y_pred = model.upscale(x)

pil_image = tensor_to_pil(y_pred.squeeze(0))

pil_image.show()
```

## Clone the Repository

You'll need the code in the repository to train new models and export them for production.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andrewdalpino/UltraZoom
```

## Install Project Dependencies

Project dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) using the following command from the project root. We recommend using a virtual environment such as `venv` to keep package dependencies on your system tidy.

```
python -m venv ./.venv

source ./.venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

To start training with the default settings, add your training and testing images to the `./dataset/train` and `./dataset/test` folders respectively and call the pretraining script like in the example below. If you are looking for good training sets to start with we recommend the `DIV2K` and/or `Flicker2K` datasets.

```
python train.py
```

You can customize the upscaler model by adjusting the `num_channels`, `hidden_ratio`, and `num_encoder_layers` hyper-parameters like in the example below.

```
python train.py --num_channels=64 --hidden_ratio=2 --num_encoder_layers=24
```

You can also adjust the `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, and `gradient_accumulation_steps` to suite your training setup.

```
python train.py --batch_size=16 --learning_rate=5e-4 --gradient_accumulation_steps=8
```

In addition, you can control various training data augmentation arguments such as the brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation jitter.

```
python train.py --brightness_jitter=0.5 --contrast_jitter=0.4 --hue_jitter=0.3 --saturation_jitter=0.2
```

### Training Dashboard

We use [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) to capture and display training events such as loss and gradient norm updates. To launch the dashboard server run the following command from the terminal.

```
tensorboard --logdir=./runs
```

Then navigate to the dashboard using your favorite web browser.

## Upscaling

You can use the provided `upscale.py` script to generate upscaled images from the trained model at the default checkpoint like in the example below. In addition, you can create your own inferencing pipeline using the same model under the hood that leverages batch processing for large scale production systems.

```
python upscale.py --image_path="./example.jpg"
```

To generate images using a different checkpoint you can use the `checkpoint_path` argument like in the example below.

```
python upscale.py --checkpoint_path="./checkpoints/fine-tuned.pt" --image_path="./example.jpg"
```
