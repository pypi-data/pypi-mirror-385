# Specification Quality Checklist: Prebuilt Model Data Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All quality checks passed. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**:
- Specification focuses on user value (zero-configuration quick start, seamless integration)
- No implementation details (no mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders with clear user scenarios

**Requirement Completeness**:
- All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-010) are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are all measurable (e.g., "30秒以内", "100%のケース", "95%以上の成功率")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not implementation)
- All user stories have clear acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover important scenarios (file not found, update failures, old data, mixed API keys)
- Scope is bounded with clear "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions are explicitly listed

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each user story is independently testable and prioritized (P1-P3)
- Primary flows covered: zero-config start (P1), API key integration (P2), automated updates (P3), transparency (P2)
- Success criteria align with user scenarios
- No implementation leakage detected
