Dataflow is an open-source Python microservice framework that simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. It provides embedded servers, auto-configuration, and minimal setup, allowing developers to build and run python apps quickly—no heavy XML or boilerplate code needed.
Python microservice = a tiny, self-contained Java app that starts in seconds, exposes REST endpoints, and ships with its own server—ready to scale and deploy independently.
