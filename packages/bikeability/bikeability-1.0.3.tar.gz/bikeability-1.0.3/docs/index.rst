Bikeability User Guide
-----------------------

Here you can find information about how to install and use the bikeability package. "Bikeability" is a Python package to automatically compute bike-friendliness of specific areas. With this library, users can download `OpenStreetMap (OSM) <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ data and generate spatial indicators for bikeability (bike facilities on main streets, green share, share of secondary and tertiary roads, node density and bike shop density). Based on these indicators, it is possible to calculate a bikeability index `(Hardinghaus et al. 2021) <https://elib.dlr.de/144713/>`_ using a weighting approach derived from an expert survey.
