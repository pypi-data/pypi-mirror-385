# FastHTML: Modern Web Applications in Pure Python

## Introduction

FastHTML is a next-generation Python web framework designed to create modern interactive web applications with minimal, compact code. It allows developers to build full-stack web applications using only Python, eliminating the need for separate JavaScript frontend frameworks by leveraging HTMX for interactivity.

Version used in this project: 0.12.x (pinned to `python-fasthtml>=0.12,<0.13`).

## Key Features and Architecture

### Core Design Philosophy

FastHTML embodies the fast.ai philosophy: remove ceremony, leverage smart defaults, and write code that's both concise and clear. The framework is built on powerful foundations:
- **Python-First**: Write entire web applications in Python without JavaScript
- **HTMX Integration**: Server-side HTML rendering with dynamic updates via hypermedia
- **Minimalist**: Under 1000 lines of code, built on Starlette, Uvicorn, and HTMX
- **1:1 Mapping**: Functionality maps directly to HTML and HTTP with good software engineering practices

### Technical Stack

FastHTML leverages:
- **Starlette**: ASGI framework for async support
- **Uvicorn**: Lightning-fast ASGI server
- **HTMX**: Hypermedia-driven interactions without JavaScript
- **Pico CSS**: Default styling (can be replaced with any CSS framework)

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install python-fasthtml
```

### Minimal Application

```python
from fasthtml import FastHTML

app = FastHTML()

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "<h1>Hello World!</h1>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

This starts a development server.

### HTMX Integration Example

```python
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return Div(
        H1("Click me!", hx_get="/change", hx_target="this"),
        id="content"
    )

@app.route("/change")
def change():
    return H1("You clicked!")
```

Elements with HTMX attributes trigger server requests that return HTML partials for DOM updates.

In 0.12+, routes should return plain strings or FastHTML elements; avoid wrapping in Starlette `HTMLResponse`/`JSONResponse` since FastHTML now wraps responses appropriately. Annotating return types as `str`/`JSONResponse` can cause double-wrapping; prefer no explicit annotation or `-> str` only when returning strings.

## API Patterns and Best Practices

### Route Handling (0.12+)

- Routes handle GET/POST by default. Use `FastHTML.add_route` if needed.
- Return HTML elements or strings directly; FastHTML generates the correct Starlette response.
- For JSON, return Python dicts; FastHTML will emit a JSON response (or use Starlette responses directly if necessary for headers/streaming).

### Component Patterns

```python
# FastHTML components accept iterables directly
def TodoList(todos):
    return Ul(*[Li(todo) for todo in todos])

# Or using map for cleaner transformation
def TodoList(todos):
    return Ul(*map(Li, todos))
```

### HTMX Attribute Conventions

- FastHTML converts `_` to `-` (e.g., `hx_on__after_request` becomes `hx-on--after-request`)
- Use `hx_swap_oob='true'` for out-of-band updates
- Element swapping pattern is key for interactive UIs

### Form Handling

HTMX form submission eliminates the Post/Redirect/Get pattern:
```python
@app.route("/form", methods=["POST"])
def handle_form(data: FormData):
    # Process form
    return Div(f"Thanks, {data.name}!")  # Return HTML directly, no redirect
```

## Database Integration

### ORM Support

FastHTML has an "ORM-like" interface supporting any async-capable Python ORM:
- Default SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for concurrent access
- Compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.0+ async features
- Supports repository/service patterns for database operations

### Example Pattern

```python
# Using async SQLAlchemy with FastHTML
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine

engine = create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///./db.sqlite3")

@app.route("/users")
async def get_users():
    async with AsyncSession(engine) as session:
        result = await session.execute(select(User))
        users = result.scalars().all()
        return Ul(*[Li(user.name) for user in users])
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Zero Configuration)

As of July 2024, FastHTML supports zero-configuration Vercel deployment:
```bash
vercel init fasthtml
# or deploy existing project
vercel
```

### Docker Deployment

See https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fh-deploy for Docker + SSL configuration

### Other Platforms

Supported platforms include:
- Railway.app (requires `main.py` as entry point)
- Hugging Face Spaces
- Replit
- PythonAnywhere
- Any VPS with Python

### Server Configuration

FastHTML uses Uvicorn as the ASGI server. Note that Apache doesn't support ASGI deployments.

## Critical Issues and Gotchas

### High Priority Issues

#### Editor/IDE Compatibility
**PyLance False Errors**: PyLance struggles with FastHTML's dynamic HTML generation syntax, reporting numerous false errors that can hide real issues.

**Mitigation**: Create a `.vscode/settings.json` with:
```json
{
  "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off",
  "python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides": {
    "reportGeneralTypeIssues": "none"
  }
}
```

#### Breaking API Changes (2024–2025)
FastHTML has undergone significant API changes since release. Code written for earlier versions may not work:

**Major Breaking Changes**:
- `jupy_app` and `FastJupy` removed (Jupyter support folded into `fast_app`).
- `RouteX` and `RouterX` removed. Use `FastHTML.add_route`.
- `ws_hdr` and `cts_hdr` removed; use `exts` (e.g., `exts='ws'`).
- FT attribute names replaced with `hx-` prefixed versions.
- Response handling changed: return plain strings/objects; avoid manually constructing Starlette `HTMLResponse`/`JSONResponse` for typical cases.

**Mitigation**: Pin FastHTML version in pyproject and monitor the FastHTML docs and releases before updates.

### Medium Priority Issues

#### LLM/AI Assistant Limitations
**Problem**: FastHTML is newer than most LLM training data (released August 2024). AI assistants provide incorrect or outdated guidance.

**Mitigation**:
- Include the official LLM context file in your project
- Reference official documentation explicitly when using AI assistance
- Verify AI-generated code against current documentation

#### Documentation Gaps
**Problem**: Many patterns and capabilities undocumented. Developers must explore source code.

**Impact**: Increased development time, trial-and-error implementation

**Mitigation**:
- Study official examples repository
- Document discovered patterns internally
- Monitor GitHub discussions for community solutions

#### Deployment Configuration Variability
**Common Issues**:
1. **Server Binding**: Default `0.0.0.0:5001` causes ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID on some systems
2. **Cloud vs Local**: Different configurations needed for cloud deployment
3. **Platform-Specific**: Each platform (Vercel, Railway, Docker) has unique requirements

**Mitigation**: Test deployment early in development cycle, maintain platform-specific configuration docs

### Low Priority But Common Issues

#### Cookie and Session Management
- Multiple cookies require special handling
- Cookie deletion in endpoints not straightforward
- Session management patterns not well established

#### OAuth Integration
- No built-in OAuth support
- Limited examples for common providers (Google, GitHub)
- Must implement token handling manually

#### Testing Patterns
- HTMX partial response testing unclear
- No official testing guide
- TestClient configuration undocumented

## Testing Strategies

### pytest Integration

FastHTML applications can be tested using standard pytest patterns:

```python
from fasthtml import FastHTML
from fasthtml.testclient import TestClient

def test_homepage():
    app = FastHTML()

    @app.route("/")
    def home():
        return H1("Test")

    client = TestClient(app)
    response = client.get("/")
    assert "Test" in response.text
```

### Best Practices

- Separate unit and integration tests using pytest markers
- Use fixtures for database and session management
- Test HTMX interactions by checking returned HTML partials
- Implement coverage testing with pytest-cov

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed Comparisons

While specific FastHTML benchmarks are limited:
- Built on Uvicorn/Starlette (among fastest Python ASGI frameworks)
- HTMX reduces client-side JavaScript overhead
- Server-side rendering can be faster for initial page loads
- Suitable for real-time applications with WebSocket support

### Optimization Strategies

- Use async route handlers for I/O-bound operations
- Implement caching for expensive computations
- Leverage SQLite WAL mode for concurrent database access
- Consider CDN for static assets

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Patterns

FastHTML supports standard authentication patterns:
```python
# User model example
@dataclass
class User:
    username: str
    password_hash: str
```

### JWT Considerations

When implementing JWT authentication:
- Always validate signatures
- Use algorithm whitelisting (not blacklisting)
- Avoid storing sensitive data in tokens
- Consider traditional sessions for stateful applications

### Best Practices

- Never expose secrets in code or logs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement CSRF protection for forms
- Validate all user input server-side
