# Debrief Progress

Update the relevant planning doc for this work if there is one. (If you don't know, there probably isn't, and you can safely ignore this suggestion.)

Report out loud on how this work is going. Any issues/surprises/complexity?

What's left to do? How complex will it be? What do you think about the cost/benefit ratio?

## Questions to Address

### Current Status
- What has been completed successfully?
- What challenges or surprises have emerged?
- Are we on track with the original plan?

### Technical Assessment
- How is the code quality holding up?
- Are there any technical debt concerns?
- What patterns or approaches are working well?

### Scope & Priority
- What remains to be done?
- How complex will the remaining work be?
- Should priorities be adjusted based on what we've learned?

### Value Assessment
- Is the cost/benefit ratio still justified?
- Are there simpler approaches that would achieve similar value?
- Should we continue, pivot, or pause this work?
