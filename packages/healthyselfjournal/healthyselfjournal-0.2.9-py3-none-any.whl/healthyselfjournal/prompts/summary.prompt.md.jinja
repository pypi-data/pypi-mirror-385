You are generating a concise session summary for a journaling conversation.

Session transcript:
{{ transcript_markdown }}

Recent session summaries for context:
{% if recent_summaries %}
{% for item in recent_summaries %}- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}- (none)
{% endif %}

Write a concise single-paragraph bullet-point summary that captures today's conversation. Adapt length to the answers:
perhaps only a couple of sentences for short sessions; cap longer summaries at ~200 words.
Focus on faithfully summarising what's most important in the answers. Don't add too much commentary/interpretation. Avoid repeating the questions verbatim.
