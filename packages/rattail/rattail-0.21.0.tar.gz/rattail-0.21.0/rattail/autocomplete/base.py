Autocomplete handlers - base class
"""

import re


class Autocompleter:
    """
    Base class and partial default implementation for autocomplete
    handlers.  It is expected that all autocomplete handlers will
    ultimately inherit from this base class, therefore it defines the
    implementation "interface" loosely speaking.  Custom autocomplete
    handlers are welcome to supplement or override this as needed, and
    in fact must do so for certain aspects.

    .. attribute:: autocompleter_key

       The key indicates what "type" of autocompleter this is.  It
       should be a string, e.g. ``'products'``.  It will generally
       correspond to the route names used in Tailbone, though not
       always.  

    .. attribute:: max_results

       If set, should return no more than this many results.  The base
       default *is* set, to 100.  Set to ``None`` to disable limiting
       the number of results.

       The reason to limit results is to avoid situations where the
       query returns many thousands of records, so that's slow anyway,
       but then the browser may well freeze up trying to process it.

       Note that your query probably should be *sorted* somehow, so
       that the e.g. "first 100" results are more relevant.

       Any subclass is free to override this, but you an also set it
       directly on an instance, e.g.::

          autocompleter = app.get_autocompleter('products')
          autocompleter.max_results = 250
          results = autocompleter.autocomplete(session, "apple cider vinegar")
