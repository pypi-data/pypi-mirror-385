class DataSyncImportConsumer(DataSyncConsumer):
    """
    Base class for any DataSync Consumer which leverages an Import
    Handler (and ultimately its Importers) to do the heavy lifting.
    See :doc:`rattail-manual:data/importing/index` for more about
    Importers etc.

    .. attribute:: handler

       Reference to the import/export handler to be leveraged by this
       datasync consumer.

       The handler is automatically instantiated when the consumer is
       instantiated, usually based on :attr:`handler_key`.

    .. attribute:: handler_key

       This should be the "key" of the import handler to be leveraged
       by the datasync consumer.  This will be a string designating
       the data target/source/direction, for example
       ``'to_rattail.from_corepos_api.import'``.

       The handler itself is obtained by invoking
       :meth:`rattail.app.AppHandler.get_import_handler()`.

       Note that for now, ``handler_key`` is not strictly required, as
       :attr:`handler_spec` will be used as a fallback.  But
       eventually that will likely change, with ``handler_spec`` being
       deprecated altogether and ``handler_key`` becoming required
       (unless you override :meth:`get_handler()`).

    .. attribute:: handler_spec

       This attribute should be considered deprecated; please use
       :attr:`handler_key` instead.

       If this attribute is used, it should be a "spec" string
       referencing the import handler class from which the importers
       should be obtained.

    .. attribute:: default_importers_only

       Flag indicating whether the consumer should *only* use "default"
       importers from the handler, vs. using "all" importers, when processing
       changes.  This flag is ``True`` by default, meaning only "default"
       importers will be used.

    .. attribute:: model_map

       This is a dictionary which may be used to map model names (importer
       "keys") between the host and local systems.  Keys of the dictionary
       should be the model name as it comes from the host system, in the form
       of :attr:`rattail.db.model.DataSyncChange.payload_type`.  Values of the
       dictionary should be the model name as it is found in the import
       handler, i.e. in its ``importer_keys()`` return value.

    .. attribute:: skip_local_models

       This is a list of model names, as they are found in the import handler.

        :meth:`rattail.app.AppHandler.get_import_handler()`.  Or if
        ``handler_key`` is not set, then for now, :attr:`handler_spec`
        may be used as fallback.
