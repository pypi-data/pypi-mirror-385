    Special "new order" autocompleter for people.

    We set it apart with a different key (``'people.neworder'``) so
    that you can override it independently of other person
    autocompleters.

    But the default logic for this one is a bit special too, in that
    it will try to search for *either* phone number *or* person name.
    If the search term includes at least 4 digits then it is
    considered to be a phone number search; otherwise it will be
    considered a name search.
