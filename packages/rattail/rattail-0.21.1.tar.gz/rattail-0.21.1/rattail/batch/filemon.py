        Make a batch from the given file path.

        :param path: Path to the source data file for the batch.

        :param type: Type of batch, specified by the batch "key" - e.g. 'labels'.

        :param handler: Spec string for the batch handler class, e.g.
           ``'rattail.batch.handheld.handler:HandheldBatchHandler'``.  Note
           that this argument is *required*.

           the batch.

        :param delete_if_empty: Set this to 'true' if you wish the batch to be
           auto-deleted in the event that it has no data rows, after being
           initially populated from the given data file.

        :param auto_execute_allowed: Set this to 'false' if you wish to disable
           auto-execution of new batches.  Default behavior is for the handler
           to decide whether each batch is eligible for auto-execution.  Note
           that it is not possible to "force" auto-execution of a batch; you
           may only "allow" or "prevent" it.
