        """
        Subscribe internal handlers to APScheduler events for monitoring and control.

        This method attaches internal listener methods to the AsyncIOScheduler instance for a variety of
        scheduler and job-related events. These listeners enable the scheduler to respond to lifecycle
        changes (such as start, shutdown, pause, and resume) and job execution events (such as submission,
        execution, errors, missed runs, max instance violations, and removals).

        Each listener is responsible for logging, invoking registered callbacks, and handling errors or
        missed jobs as appropriate. This setup ensures that the scheduler's state and job execution
        are monitored and managed effectively.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It registers event listeners on the scheduler instance.

        Notes
        -----
        The listeners are attached to the following APScheduler events:
            - Scheduler started
            - Scheduler shutdown
            - Job error
            - Job submitted
            - Job executed
            - Job missed
            - Job max instances exceeded
            - Job removed

        These listeners enable the scheduler to handle and react to all critical scheduling events.

        Invoke registered listeners for global scheduler events.

        This method is responsible for handling global scheduler events such as when the scheduler starts, pauses, resumes,

            and the scheduled run time (`scheduled_run_time`).

        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs logging, reporting, and invokes any registered
            listener for the missed job event.

        Notes
        -----
        - This method is intended for internal use to centralize the handling of missed job events.
        - It ensures that missed jobs are logged and that any custom listeners associated with the job are properly notified.
        - The event entity created provides structured information to listeners for further processing.

        it converts the event to its entity representation, adds it to the jobs list, and schedules
        it in the AsyncIOScheduler with the appropriate configuration. If a listener is associated

        - Events are only loaded if the internal jobs list is empty.

            The name of the event to listen for. This can be a string representing

        listener : IScheduleEventListener or callable
            The listener to be registered. This can be a callable function or an

        Check if the scheduler is currently paused.

        This method determines whether the scheduler is in a paused state by checking if there are
        any jobs that were paused using the `pause` method. If there are jobs in the internal set
        `__pausedByPauseEverything`, it indicates that the scheduler has been paused.

        Returns
        -------
        bool

        Forcefully stop the scheduler immediately, bypassing graceful shutdown.

        This method immediately shuts down the AsyncIOScheduler instance without waiting for any currently
        running jobs to finish. It is intended for emergency or critical situations where an abrupt stop
        is required, such as unrecoverable errors or forced application termination. In addition to shutting
        down the scheduler, it also signals the internal stop event to interrupt the scheduler's main loop,
        allowing the application to proceed with its shutdown procedures.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs a forceful shutdown of the scheduler and
            signals the stop event to ensure the main loop is interrupted.

        Notes
        -----
        - This method should be used with caution, as it does not wait for running jobs to complete.
        - After calling this method, the scheduler will be stopped and any pending or running jobs may be interrupted.

        """
        Signal the scheduler to stop synchronously by setting the internal stop event.

        This method is used to request a graceful shutdown of the scheduler from a synchronous context.
        It sets the internal asyncio stop event, which will cause the scheduler's main loop to exit.
        If an asyncio event loop is currently running, the stop event is set in a thread-safe manner
        using `call_soon_threadsafe`. If no event loop is running, the stop event is set directly.
        This method is safe to call from both asynchronous and synchronous contexts.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It only signals the scheduler to stop by setting
            the internal stop event.

        Notes
        -----
        - If the stop event is already set or does not exist, this method does nothing.
        - Any exceptions encountered while setting the stop event are logged as warnings, but the
          method will still attempt to set the event directly.
