> **Use [Claude's powerful new Skills system](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) with ANY AI model or coding assistant** - including Cursor, Codex, GPT-5, Gemini, and more. This MCP server brings Anthropic's Agent Skills framework to the entire AI ecosystem through the Model Context Protocol.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides intelligent search capabilities for discovering relevant Claude Agent Skills using vector embeddings and semantic similarity. This server implements the same progressive disclosure architecture that Anthropic describes in their [Agent Skills engineering blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills), making specialized skills available to any MCP-compatible AI application.

**An open-source project by [K-Dense AI](https://k-dense.ai)** - creators of autonomous AI scientists for scientific research.

This MCP server enables any MCP-compatible AI assistant to intelligently search and retrieve skills from our curated [Claude Scientific Skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills) repository and other skill sources like the [Official Claude Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills). If you want substantially more advanced capabilities, compute infrastructure, and enterprise-ready AI scientist offerings, check out [K-Dense AI's commercial platform](https://k-dense.ai/).

## Features

- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings for intelligent skill discovery
- 📚 **Progressive Disclosure**: Multi-level skill loading (metadata → full content → files)
- 🚀 **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with curated skills
- 🌐 **Multi-Source**: Load from GitHub repositories and local directories
- ⚡ **Fast & Local**: No API keys needed, with automatic GitHub caching
- 🔧 **Configurable**: Customize sources, models, and content limits

## Quick Start

### For Cursor Users

Install with one command (handles everything automatically):

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-skills-mcp/main/setup-cursor.sh | bash
```

Then restart Cursor. See [Setup Instructions](#cursor-recommended) for details.

### Using uvx (Standalone)

Run the server with default configuration (no installation required):

```bash
uvx claude-skills-mcp
```

This loads ~90 skills from Anthropic's official skills repository and K-Dense AI's scientific skills collection.

### With Custom Configuration

To customize skill sources or search parameters:

```bash
# 1. Print the default configuration
uvx claude-skills-mcp --example-config > config.json

# 2. Edit config.json to your needs

# 3. Run with your custom configuration
uvx claude-skills-mcp --config config.json
```

## Setup for Your AI Assistant

### Cursor (Recommended)

**⚠️ Important**: To avoid startup timeout issues, run our one-line setup script **before** configuring Cursor.

#### Quick Install (One Command)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-skills-mcp/main/setup-cursor.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- ✅ Install `uv` if needed (no root/sudo required)
- ✅ Pre-download all dependencies (~250 MB, one-time)
- ✅ Auto-configure Cursor's MCP settings
- ✅ Takes 60-120 seconds on first run

**Then restart Cursor** and you're done! 🎉

The script is **completely safe**:
- No root access required
- Installs only to your home directory (`~/.cargo`, `~/.cache`, `~/.cursor`)
- Creates backups of existing configurations
- [View source code](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-skills-mcp/blob/main/setup-cursor.sh)

<summary>Manual Configuration (Advanced)</summary>

If you prefer to configure manually:

**Step 1: Pre-cache dependencies** (critical to avoid timeout):
```bash
uvx claude-skills-mcp --help
```
Wait for it to complete (~60-120 seconds).

**Step 2: Add to Cursor's MCP settings** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-skills": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["claude-skills-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Restart Cursor**

Your configuration will use `uvx` which auto-updates the server when new versions are released.

### Claude Desktop

Add to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-skills": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["claude-skills-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop to activate.

### Other MCP-Compatible Tools

Any tool supporting the Model Context Protocol can use this server via `uvx claude-skills-mcp`. Consult your tool's MCP configuration documentation.

## Architecture

Built on five core components: Configuration (JSON-based config loading), Skill Loader (GitHub + local with automatic caching), Search Engine (sentence-transformers vector search), MCP Server (three tools with stdio transport), and CLI Entry Point (argument parsing and lifecycle management).

See [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md) for detailed design, data flow, and extension points.

## Configuration

The server uses a JSON configuration file to specify skill sources and search parameters.

### Default Configuration

If no config file is specified, the server uses these defaults:

```json
{
  "skill_sources": [
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/anthropics/skills"
    },
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills"
    },
    {
      "type": "local",
      "path": "~/.claude/skills"
    }
  ],
  "embedding_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  "default_top_k": 3,
  "max_skill_content_chars": null
}
```

This loads ~90 skills by default: 15 from Anthropic (document tools, web artifacts, etc.) + 78 from K-Dense AI (scientific analysis tools) + any custom local skills.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `skill_sources` | Array | Anthropic repo | GitHub repos or local paths |
| `embedding_model` | String | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Sentence-transformers model |
| `default_top_k` | Integer | `3` | Number of results to return |
| `max_skill_content_chars` | Integer/null | `null` | Content truncation limit |
| `load_skill_documents` | Boolean | `true` | Load additional skill files |
| `max_image_size_bytes` | Integer | `5242880` | Max image size (5MB) |

To customize, run `uvx claude-skills-mcp --example-config > config.json` to see all options, or check [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md) for advanced patterns.

## MCP Tools

The server provides three tools for working with Claude Agent Skills:

1. **`search_skills`** - Semantic search for relevant skills based on task description
2. **`read_skill_document`** - Retrieve specific files (scripts, data, references) from skills  
3. **`list_skills`** - View complete inventory of all loaded skills (for exploration/debugging)

See [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for detailed parameters, examples, and best practices.

### Quick Examples

**Find skills:** "I need to analyze RNA sequencing data"  
**Access files:** "Show me Python scripts from the scanpy skill"  
**List all:** "What skills are available?"

For task-oriented queries, prefer `search_skills` over `list_skills`.

## Skill Format

The server searches for `SKILL.md` files with the following format:

```markdown
---
name: Skill Name
description: Brief description of what this skill does
---

# Skill Name

[Full skill content in Markdown...]
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- `mcp>=1.0.0` - Model Context Protocol
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.0` - Vector embeddings (uses CPU-only PyTorch on Linux)
- `numpy>=1.24.0` - Numerical operations
- `httpx>=0.24.0` - HTTP client for GitHub API

**Note on PyTorch**: This project uses CPU-only PyTorch on Linux systems to avoid unnecessary CUDA dependencies (~3-4 GB). This significantly reduces Docker image size and build time while maintaining full functionality for semantic search.

### Python Version

- Requires: **Python 3.12** (not 3.13)
- Dependencies are automatically managed by uv/uvx

### Performance

- **Startup time**: ~10-20 seconds (loads SKILL.md files only with lazy document loading)
- **Query time**: <1 second for vector search
- **Document access**: On-demand with automatic disk caching
- **Memory usage**: ~500MB (embedding model + indexed skills)
- **First run**: Downloads ~100MB embedding model (cached thereafter)
- **Docker image size**: ~1-2 GB (uses CPU-only PyTorch, no CUDA dependencies)

## How It Works

This server implements Anthropic's **progressive disclosure** architecture:

1. **Startup**: Load SKILL.md files from GitHub/local sources, generate vector embeddings
2. **Search**: Match task queries against skill descriptions using cosine similarity  
3. **Progressive Loading**: Return metadata → full content → referenced files as needed
4. **Lazy Document Loading**: Additional skill documents fetched on-demand with automatic disk caching
5. **Two-Level Caching**: GitHub API responses (24h) + individual documents (permanent)

This enables any MCP-compatible AI assistant to intelligently discover and load relevant skills with minimal context overhead and fast startup. See [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md) for details.

## Skill Sources

Load skills from **GitHub repositories** (direct skills or Claude Code plugins) or **local directories**. 

By default, loads from:
- [Official Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) - 15 diverse skills for documents, presentations, web artifacts, and more
- [K-Dense AI Scientific Skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills) - 78+ specialized skills for bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and scientific analysis
- Local directory `~/.claude/skills` (if it exists)

## Error Handling

The server is designed to be resilient:
- If a local folder is inaccessible, it logs a warning and continues
- If a GitHub repo fails to load, it tries alternate branches and continues
- If no skills are loaded, the server exits with an error message

## Troubleshooting

### Cursor Startup Timeout

**Problem**: Cursor shows "MCP server failed to start" or timeout errors.

**Solution**: Run the setup script before configuring Cursor:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-skills-mcp/main/setup-cursor.sh | bash
```

This pre-downloads all dependencies (~250 MB) so Cursor can start the server quickly (5-10 seconds).

**Why this happens**: On first run, `uvx` needs to download dependencies including PyTorch (~150 MB) and sentence-transformers (~50 MB), which can take 60-180 seconds and exceed Cursor's startup timeout.

### Manual Pre-Caching

If you prefer not to use the setup script, you can manually pre-cache:

```bash
uvx claude-skills-mcp --help
```

Wait for it to complete (~60-120 seconds), then configure Cursor normally.

### Slow First Search

**Expected behavior**: The first search after server startup takes 3-5 seconds to load the embedding model (~100 MB download, one-time).

This is normal and only happens once. The model is cached permanently at `~/.cache/huggingface/`.

### Skills Not Loading

**Problem**: Search returns no results or "No skills loaded".

**Check**:
1. Network connectivity (for GitHub sources)
2. GitHub API rate limits (60 requests/hour without token)
3. Verbose logs: `uvx claude-skills-mcp --verbose`

**Solution**: Use local skills or wait for rate limit reset.

## Docker Deployment

### Building Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t claude-skills-mcp -f Dockerfile.glama .
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker run -it claude-skills-mcp
```

The optimized Dockerfile uses CPU-only PyTorch to minimize image size and build time while maintaining full functionality.
