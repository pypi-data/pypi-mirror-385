`pysynthbio` is an Python package that provides a convenient interface to the [Synthesize Bio](https://www.synthesize.bio/) API, allowing users to generate realistic gene expression data based on specified biological conditions. This package enables researchers to easily access AI-generated transcriptomic data for various modalities including bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq.

If you'd prefer 1-click dataset generation and analysis, try our [web platform](https://app.synthesize.bio/datasets/).

## Prerequisites

Create a [Synthesize Bio](https://app.synthesize.bio/) account and generate an [API Key](https://app.synthesize.bio/account/api-key).
