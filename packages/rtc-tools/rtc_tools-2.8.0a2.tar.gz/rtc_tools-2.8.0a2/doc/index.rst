RTC-Tools documentation
=======================

This is the documentation for RTC-Tools, the `Deltares
<https://www.deltares.nl/>`_ toolbox for control and optimization of
environmental systems.

Visit the `RTC-Tools website <https://oss.deltares.nl/web/rtc-tools/home>`_
for a general product description and information on available services.

This first chapter covers getting the software running on your computer.  The
subsequent two chapters describe the RTC-Tools Python API.  The fourth and final
chapter discusses several illustrative examples, including the use of goal
programming for multi-objective optimization, as well as the use of forecast
ensembles.
