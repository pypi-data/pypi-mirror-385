# This file contains revisions to be ignored by git blame.
# These revisions are expected to be formatting-only changes.
#
# Calling `git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs` will
# tell git blame to ignore changes made by these revisions when assigning
# assigning blame, as if the change never happened.
#
# You can enable this as a default for your local repository by running
# `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`
# This will probably be automatically picked by your IDE
#
# Important: if you are switching to the branch without this file,
# `git blame` will fail with an error
#
# Guidelines:
# - Only large automated refactorings are expected to be included in this file.
#   Do not add new revision just because it feels unimportant
# - Add a link to the relevant issue/MR
