              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

**Adobe Helper** is a Python library for converting PDF files to Word (DOCX) format using Adobe's online conversion services. It provides a clean, async API with automatic session management, rate limiting, and quota tracking.

## ⚠️ Current Status

**This project is ~98% complete.** The architecture, all modules, and examples are fully implemented and tested. However, **API endpoint discovery is required** before the library can perform actual conversions.

### Recent Updates (2025-10-21)

✅ **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- Automatic tenant discovery during session initialization
- Dynamic endpoint switching per session
- Support for multiple regions and tenant IDs
- Each session discovers its own numeric tenant ID from Adobe's servers

✅ **Logging Enhancement**
- Examples now include proper logging configuration
- Real-time visibility into conversion progress
- Better debugging and troubleshooting support

See [docs/discovery/API_DISCOVERY.md](docs/discovery/API_DISCOVERY.md) for instructions on discovering Adobe's actual API endpoints using Chrome DevTools.

## Features

✨ **Easy to Use**
- Simple async API with context manager support
- Automatic session management and rotation
- Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Bypass local usage limits** (mimics clearing browser data)

📊 **Smart Management**
- Optional usage tracking with daily limits
- Intelligent rate limiting with human-like delays
- Automatic session rotation for unlimited conversions
- Fresh session creation (like incognito mode)

🔒 **Reliable**
- Streaming upload/download for large files
- File integrity verification
- Comprehensive error handling
- Progress tracking support

🚀 **Fast**
- Async/await throughout
- HTTP/2 support via httpx
- Concurrent batch processing

## Installation

### Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karlorz/adobe-helper.git
cd adobe-helper

# Install with uv
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karlorz/adobe-helper.git
cd adobe-helper

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from adobe import AdobePDFConverter

# Configure logging to see conversion progress
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
)

async def main():
    # Convert a PDF to Word (bypasses local limits by default)
    async with AdobePDFConverter(
        bypass_local_limits=True  # Mimics clearing browser data
    ) as converter:
        output_file = await converter.convert_pdf_to_word(
            Path("document.pdf")
        )
        print(f"Converted: {output_file}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Batch Conversion

```python
from adobe import AdobePDFConverter

async def batch_convert():
    pdf_files = [
        Path("doc1.pdf"),
        Path("doc2.pdf"),
        Path("doc3.pdf"),
    ]

    async with AdobePDFConverter() as converter:
        for pdf_file in pdf_files:
            try:
                output = await converter.convert_pdf_to_word(pdf_file)
                print(f"✓ {pdf_file.name} -> {output.name}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"✗ {pdf_file.name}: {e}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from adobe import AdobePDFConverter
from pathlib import Path

async def advanced_convert():
    # Custom configuration
    converter = AdobePDFConverter(
        session_dir=Path(".cache"),      # Custom cache directory
        use_session_rotation=True,       # Enable session rotation
        track_usage=True,                # Track daily quota
        enable_rate_limiting=True,       # Rate limiting
    )

    try:
        await converter.initialize()

        # Convert with custom output path
        output = await converter.convert_pdf_to_word(
            Path("input.pdf"),
            output_path=Path("output/converted.docx"),
        )

        # Check usage stats
        usage = converter.get_usage_summary()
        print(f"Daily usage: {usage['count']}/{usage['limit']}")

    finally:
        await converter.close()
```

## Endpoint Discovery CLI

Use the bundled helper to capture endpoints and keep discovery files synced:

```bash
# Show available commands
python -m adobe.cli.api_discovery_helper --help

# Create or refresh the project discovery template
python -m adobe.cli.api_discovery_helper template

# Validate captured URLs and sync project ↔ user cache copies
python -m adobe.cli.api_discovery_helper update

# Installed entry point (after `pip install .`)
adobe-api-discovery checklist
```

See [docs/discovery/API_DISCOVERY.md](docs/discovery/API_DISCOVERY.md) for the full walkthrough.

The helper stores discovered endpoints in `~/.adobe-helper` by default, but will fall back to `./.adobe-helper` (or the system temp directory) automatically when the home directory is not writable—useful for containerized or sandboxed environments.

## Architecture

### Core Components

### Data Flow

```
PDF File → Upload → Conversion Job → Poll Status → Download DOCX
           ↓         ↓                 ↓             ↓

```

## Examples

See the [`examples/adobe/`](examples/adobe/) directory for complete examples:

- **basic_usage.py** - Simple conversion with bypass enabled
- **batch_convert.py** - Sequential and concurrent batch processing
- **advanced_usage.py** - Advanced configuration and error handling

Legacy bypass/reset scripts now live under `archive/docs/` for reference.

### Bypassing Usage Limits

By default, the library now bypasses local usage tracking and relies on Adobe's server-side limits with automatic session rotation:

```python
# Automatic session rotation (recommended for batch processing)
async with AdobePDFConverter(
    bypass_local_limits=True,  # Default: True
    use_session_rotation=True,  # Auto-rotate sessions
) as converter:
    for pdf in pdf_files:
        await converter.convert_pdf_to_word(pdf)
```

For more details, see [BYPASS_LIMITS.md](BYPASS_LIMITS.md).

**Quick reset**: Call `AdobePDFConverter.reset_session_data()` (or use `AdobePDFConverter.create_with_fresh_session()`) to clear all local state; the legacy helper script now resides in `archive/docs/`.

## API Discovery Required

⚠️ **Important**: Before this library can perform actual conversions, you need to discover Adobe's API endpoints using Chrome DevTools.

See [docs/discovery/API_DISCOVERY.md](docs/discovery/API_DISCOVERY.md) for detailed instructions.

Discovered endpoint files are cached automatically: any `discovered_endpoints.json` found in `docs/discovery/` or `archive/discovery/` is copied into `~/.adobe-helper/` on first run, and a template is generated if missing.
