Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any individual human being using this software for personal, educational, artistic, or independent research purposes, subject to the following conditions:

Non-Commercial Use Only
This software may not be used, directly or indirectly, for any commercial, corporate, governmental, or institutional purpose, including but not limited to:

Selling, licensing, or distributing derivative works;

Integrating into products or services for profit;

Use within companies, startups, or funded research without explicit written consent from the copyright holder.

No Corporate or Financial Derivatives
The software may not be used as part of any system, product, or workflow that generates, facilitates, or supports monetary gain or financial transactions, whether direct or indirect.

Personal Freedom Clause (Extended)
Independent individuals may modify, fork, and share the software non-commercially provided that this license text is included and preserved in full.
Any forks, modifications, or derivative works inherit the same non-commercial restrictions. They may not be relicensed or distributed under terms that weaken, override, or remove this license’s restrictions.
If such modified or forked versions are publicly released, they must remain open-source and freely accessible under this same license.
When public redistribution or reuse is infeasible (e.g., research projects, local modifications), attribution must still be given and rights are not transferred to the user, institution, or publisher.

The author kindly requests that, when practical, modified or derivative versions be published openly so the community can benefit. However, lack of publication does not grant any ownership or licensing rights beyond this license.

Academic & Research Use
Use for academic, non-profit, or individual research is permitted without fee, provided the work includes proper citation or acknowledgment of the original author and repository in any publication, dataset, or derivative research output.

Attribution
Any redistributions or derivative works must credit the original author by name (“Fatih Burak Karagöz”) and include a visible link to the original repository.

Permission Required for Commercial Use
Written permission from the copyright holder is required for any commercial, corporate, institutional, or governmental use. Absence of response does not imply consent.

This software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use or inability to use the software.
