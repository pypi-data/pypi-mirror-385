# mchplnet
- mchplnet is the Python implementation of the LNet protocol.
- It implements multiple LNet services to communicate to embedded systems/microcontrollers.
- Currently only pyserial interface is supported. 
- It is recommended to use the pyx2cscope package, which offers a higher-level interface.

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the Examples directory in the mchplnet project to explore the available examples or create a new .py file based on your requirements.
2. Import the necessary classes:
```
from mchplnet.interfaces.factory import InterfaceFactory
from mchplnet.interfaces.factory import InterfaceType as IType
from mchplnet.lnet import LNet
```
3. Create an interface according to your requirements and initialize the LNet with the interface:
```
interface = InterfaceFactory.get_interface(IType.SERIAL, port="COM8", baudrate=115200)
l_net = mchplnet.LNet(interface))
```
4. Use the appropriate functions, such as get_ram, to interact with variables by specifying their address and size:

```
var_address = 0x00000000
var_size = 4 
var_value = l_net.get_ram(var_address, var_size) 
logging.debug(var_value)
```
5. To modify the value of a variable, use the put_ram function:

```
var_newValue = 500
l_net.put_ram(var_address, var_size, var_newValue)
```

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/X2Cscope/mchplnet.git
   cd mchplnet
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r quality.txt
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
