    Represents a single content page.

    HASHABILITY:
    ============
    Pages are hashable based on their source_path, allowing them to be stored
    in sets and used as dictionary keys. This enables:
    - Fast membership tests (O(1) instead of O(n))
    - Automatic deduplication with sets
    - Set operations for page analysis
    - Direct use as dictionary keys

    Two pages with the same source_path are considered equal, even if their
    content differs. The hash is stable throughout the page lifecycle because
    source_path is immutable. Mutable fields (content, rendered_html, etc.)
    do not affect the hash or equality.

    BUILD LIFECYCLE:
    ================
    Pages progress through distinct build phases. Properties have different
    availability depending on the current phase:

    1. Discovery (content_discovery.py)
       ✅ Available: source_path, content, metadata, title, slug, date
       ❌ Not available: toc, parsed_ast, toc_items, rendered_html

    2. Parsing (pipeline.py)
       ✅ Available: All Stage 1 + toc, parsed_ast
       ✅ toc_items can be accessed (will extract from toc)

    3. Rendering (pipeline.py)
       ✅ Available: All previous + rendered_html, output_path
       ✅ All properties fully populated

    Note: Some properties like toc_items can be accessed early (returning [])
    but won't cache empty results, allowing proper extraction after parsing.

    Attributes:
        source_path: Path to the source content file
        content: Raw content (Markdown, etc.)
        metadata: Frontmatter metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)
        parsed_ast: Abstract Syntax Tree from parsed content
        rendered_html: Rendered HTML output
        output_path: Path where the rendered page will be written
        links: List of links found in the page
        tags: Tags associated with the page
        version: Version information for versioned content
        toc: Table of contents HTML (auto-generated from headings)
        toc_items: Structured TOC data for custom rendering
        related_posts: Related pages (pre-computed during build based on tag overlap)
