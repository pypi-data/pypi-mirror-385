"""
Atomic file writing utilities.

Provides crash-safe file writes using the write-to-temp-then-rename pattern.
This ensures files are never left in a partially written state.

If a process crashes during write, the original file (if any) remains intact.
Files are always either in their old complete state or new complete state,
never partially written.

Example:
    >>> from bengal.utils.atomic_write import atomic_write_text
    >>> atomic_write_text('output.html', '<html>...</html>')
    # If crash occurs during write:
    # - output.html is either old version (if existed) or missing
    # - Never partially written!

    Write text to a file atomically.

    Uses write-to-temp-then-rename to ensure the file is never partially written.
    If the process crashes during write, the original file (if any) remains intact.

    either completely succeeds or completely fails - there's no partial state.
