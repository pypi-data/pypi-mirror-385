`Section` objects or precomputed string paths depending on context (e.g.,
runtime vs cached/incremental data structures).

    """
    Resolve a page's section path as a string, handling multiple representations.

    The page may expose its section association in different ways depending on
    build phase or caching:
    - `page.section` may be a `Section` object with a `.path` attribute
    - `page.section` may already be a string path
    - It may be missing or falsy for root-level pages

    Args:
        page: Page-like object which may have a `section` attribute

        String path to the section (e.g., "docs/tutorials") or None if not set.
