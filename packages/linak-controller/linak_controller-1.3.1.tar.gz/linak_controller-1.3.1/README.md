# linak-controller

(Previously `idasen-controller`)

Linak make motorised standing desks. They can be controlled by a physical switch on the desks or via bluetooth using an phone app. This is a script to control Linak desks via bluetooth from any other device.

Note: This script may not work with all Linak desks - see below for comaptible models.

## Set up

### Prerequisites

- Windows / Linux / Mac
- The device should have Python 3
- The desk should be paired to the device.

### Working Desks

- Ikea Idasen - works (my desk!)
- iMovr Lander - reported working [43](https://github.com/rhyst/linak-controller/issues/43)
- Linak DPG1C - reported working [32](https://github.com/rhyst/linak-controller/issues/32)
- Linak DPG1M - reported working [32](https://github.com/rhyst/linak-controller/issues/32)

If you find another desk model that works please make an issue to report it!

### Install

Install using pip:

```
pip3 install linak-controller
```

### Configuration

Configuration can be provided with a file, or via command line arguments. Use `--help` to see the command line arguments help. Edit `<config_dir>/config.yaml` if you prefer your config to be in a file. `<config_dir>` is normally:

- `~/.config/linak-controller` on Linux
- `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\linak-controller\linak-controller` on Windows
- `~/Library/Application Support/linak-controller` on MacOS

Config options:

| Option                | Description                                                                                           | Default                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `mac_address`         | The MAC address (or UUID on MacOS) of the desk. This is required.                                     |                             |
| `base_height`         | The lowest possible height (mm) of the desk top from the floor By default this is read from the desk. | `null`.                     |
| `adapter_name`        | The adapter name for the bluetooth adapter to use for the connection (Linux only).                    | `hci0`                      |
| `scan_timeout`        | Timeout to scan for the device (seconds).                                                             | `5`                         |
| `connection_timeout`  | Timeout to obtain connection (seconds).                                                               | `10`                        |
| `move_command_period` | Time between move commands when using `move-to` (seconds).                                            | `0.4`                       |
| `server_address`      | The address the server should run at (if running server).                                             | `127.0.0.1`                 |
| `server_port`         | The port the server should run on (if running server).                                                | `9123`                      |
| `favourites`          | Favourite heights object where the key is the name and the value is the height                        | `{ sit: 683, stand: 1040 }` |

All of these options (except `favourites`) can be set on the command line, just replace any `_` with `-` e.g. `mac_address` becomes `--mac-address`.

#### Device MAC addresses

- On Linux, device MAC addresses can be found using `bluetoothctl` and bluetooth adapter names can be found with `hcitool dev`
- On Windows you can use [Bluetooth LE Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/bluetooth-le-explorer/9n0ztkf1qd98?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
- On MacOS you can pair the device with [Bluetility](https://github.com/jnross/Bluetility), but you must use the UUID instead of the Mac Address.

## Usage

The script accepts a number of commands:

| Command                      | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                              | Running without any command will print the current desk height                                    |
| `--watch`                    | Watch desk and print changes to height (and speed)                                                |
| `--move-to <value>`          | Move the desk to a certain height (mm) above the floor                                            |
| `--scan`                     | List available bluetooth devices (using the configured `adapter_name`)                            |
| `--server`                   | Run the script as a server, which will maintain the connection and provide quicker response times |
| `--tcp-server`               | Run the script as a simpler tcp only server                                                       |
| `--forward <other commands>` | Send commands to a server                                                                         |
| `--config <path>`            | Specify a path to a config file                                                                   |

### Moving the desk

To move to a particular height you can run:

```
linak-controller --move-to 800
```

If you have configured favourite values in the `config.yaml` like this:

```
favourites:
  sit: 683
  stand: 1040
```

Then you can also pass the favourite name to the `--move-to` command:

```
linak-controller --move-to sit
```

### Using the Server

You can run the script in a server mode. This will maintain a persistent connection to the desk and then listen on the specified port for commands. This has a number of uses, one of which is making the response time a lot quicker. Both the server and client will print the current height and speed of the desk as it moves.

Remember to ensure that the ports and IPs are configured in both the server and client `config.yaml` files (or provide them as command line arguments).

You can start the server like this:

```
linak-controller --server
```

And then on the same or different device:

```
linak-controller --forward --move-to 800
```

You can also use any of the favourites that are configured on the server:

```
linak-controller --forward --move-to stand
```

You can also directly post a JSON object to the server:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9123 --data '{"key": "move_to", "value": 640}'
```

There is also a simpler TCP server mode which you can with:

```
linak-controller --tcp-server
```

And then use any tool you like to send commands. For example you could use `nc` on linux:

```
echo '{"key": "move_to", "value": 640}' | nc -w 1 127.0.0.1 9123
```

If you use the `linak-controller` command to send commands to the server then you will receive live logging back from the server, which you will not receive if you post JSON or use the TCP server.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection failed

The initial connection can fail for a variety of reasons, here are some things to try if it happens repeatedly:

- Try ensuring that the desk is paired but _not_ connected before using the script.
- Try increasing the `scan-timeout` and `connection-timeout`.

### Connection / commands are slow

- Try reducing the `connection-timeout`. I have found that it can work well set to just `1` second. You may find that a low connection timeout results in failed connections sometimes though.
- Use the server mode. Run the script once with `--server` which will start a persistent server and maintain a connection to the desk. Then when sending commands (like `--move-to sit` or `--move-to 800`) just add the additional argument `--forward` to forward the command to the server. The server should already have a connection so the desk should respond much quicker.

### Error message "abort" on MacOS

On MacOS the process may quit with a vague message like `abort`. This could be because the application running the process doesn't have access to Bluetooth. To provide access, open `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Bluetooth` and drag the application running the process into the list (eg. Terminal or iTerm2). [More info at the `bleak` issue](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/issues/438#issuecomment-787125189)

### Scanning and connection issues on MacOS 12 (Monterey)

There was a bug with MacOS 12 that prevents connecting to bluetooth devices with this script [see this issue](https://github.com/rhyst/linak-controller/issues/33) or [this bleak issue for more info](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/issues/635#issuecomment-988054876).

You should update to MacOS 12.3 which fixes this issue.

### Desk movement stuttering

Try lowering the `move_command_period` config value.

## Recipes

There is a page with a few examples of different ways to use the script: [RECIPES](recipes/RECIPES.md)

## Development

First install `uv`. Then you can run the script with:

```
uv run -m linak_controller.main <command>
```

You can also install the project in editable/development mode with:
