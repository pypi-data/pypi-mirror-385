#### Option 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended for beginners)

1. **Navigate to your project directory**
   ```bash
   cd my-awesome-project
   ```

2. **Run interactive setup and deployment**
   ```bash
   deployx interactive
   ```

#### Option 2: Step-by-step

1. **Navigate to your project directory**
   ```bash
   cd my-awesome-project
   ```

2. **Initialize deployment configuration**
   ```bash
   deployx init
   ```

3. **Deploy your project**
   ```bash
   deployx deploy
   ```

4. **Check deployment status**
   ```bash
   deployx status
   ```

That's it! Your project is now live. üéâ

### Additional Commands

**Preview before deploying:**
```bash
deployx deploy --dry-run        # See what would happen before actually deploying
```

**Manage configuration:**
```bash
deployx config show             # View current config
deployx config validate         # Check config is valid
```

## üìö Commands

```bash
# Setup and deploy in one go
deployx interactive

# Initialize configuration
deployx init

# Deploy your project
deployx deploy
deployx deploy --dry-run        # Preview without deploying
deployx deploy --force          # Skip confirmations

# Check status and logs
deployx status
deployx logs --follow

# Manage configuration
deployx config show
deployx config edit

# View deployment history
deployx history --limit 10
```

Use `deployx [command] --help` for detailed options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

DeployX creates a `deployx.yml` file in your project root:

```yaml
project:
  name: "my-app"
  type: "react"

build:
  command: "npm run build"
  output: "build"

platform: "github"

github:
  repo: "username/repository"
  method: "branch"
  branch: "gh-pages"
```

Other platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, Render) use similar simple configurations.

## üîß Platform Setup

DeployX will prompt for tokens during setup. Get them from:

- **GitHub**: [Settings > Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (needs `repo`, `workflow`)
- **Vercel**: [Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
- **Netlify**: [User Settings](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens)
- **Railway**: [Account Settings](https://railway.app/account/tokens)
- **Render**: [API Keys](https://dashboard.render.com/account/api-keys)

Tokens are saved securely and added to `.gitignore` automatically.
