Installation
============

Setup using Python
------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- OS: Linux
- Python: 3.9 -- 3.13
- GPU: NVIDIA compute capability 7.0+ (e.g., V100, T4, RTX20xx, A100, L4, H100, B200, etc.)
- CUDA 12.1+
- uv (Python package manager): ``curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh``

.. note::
    LMCache does not support Windows natively. To run LMCache on Windows, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with a compatible Linux distribution, or use some community-maintained forks.

(Recommended) Install Stable LMCache from PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to install the latest stable release of LMCache is through PyPI.
If you require a different version of torch for the LMCache instance that you built with (symbol undefined error), please follow the install from source instructions below.

.. code-block:: bash

    uv venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # LMCache wheels are built with the latest version of torch.
    # vllm is required for LMCache to work; you may also choose to install it separately.
    uv pip install lmcache vllm

.. important::

   You're all set! You can now start using LMCache. For hands-on guides and more usage examples, see the :ref:`quickstart_examples` section.

Install Latest LMCache from TestPyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TestPyPI wheels are continually built from the latest LMCache source code (not officially stable release). 

.. code-block:: bash

    uv venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # By default, this will adopt the version of torch from the latest *NIGHTLY* vLLM wheel.
    # If you require a different version of torch for the LMCache instance that you built with (symbol undefined error), please
    # follow the install from source instructions below. 
    uv pip install --index-url https://pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple lmcache==0.3.4.dev61

See the latest pre-release of LMCache: `latest LMCache pre-releases <https://test.pypi.org/project/lmcache/#history>`__ and replace `0.3.4.dev61` with the latest pre-release version.

This will install all dependencies from the real PyPI and only LMCache itself from TestPyPI.

Confirm that you have the latest pre-release:

.. code-block:: bash

    python
    >>> import lmcache
    >>> from importlib.metadata import version
    >>> print(version("lmcache"))
    0.3.4.dev61 # should be the latest pre-release version you installed

Install Latest LMCache from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install from source, clone the repository and install in editable mode. 

`--no-build-isolation` bypasses `PEP 517 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/>`_ / `PEP 518 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/>`_
avoiding a potential issue where LMCache's kernels are compiled with `torch.utils.cuda_extension` or `torch.utils.hipify`
inside of `setup.py` with one torch version while during runtime, the version of torch differs across major versions 
(which is possible because LMCache intentionally has an unpinned torch version in `requirements/common.txt`), causing 
linker issues that will show up as undefined symbol references.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.git
    cd LMCache

    uv venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Need to install these packages manually to avoid build isolation
    uv pip install -r requirements/build.txt

    # Option 1. 
    # select the torch version that matches the dependency of your serving engine
    # 2.7.1 is an example for vllm 0.10.0
    uv pip install torch==2.7.1

    # Option 2. 
    # install your serving engine with its required torch version bundled
    # example: vllm 0.10.0 will install torch 2.7.1
    uv pip install vllm==0.10.0

    # no build isolation requires torch to already be installed
    # with your desired version
    uv pip install -e . --no-build-isolation

You can quickly test whether you have undefined symbol references by running: 

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -c "import lmcache.c_ops"

LMCache with vLLM v1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LMCache is integrated with the latest vLLM (vLLM v1). To use it, install the latest vLLM package:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv pip install vllm

Test whether LMCache works with vLLM v1 by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -c "import vllm.distributed.kv_transfer.kv_connector.v1.lmcache_connector"

LMCache with vLLM v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    LMCache is also integrated with vLLM v0. Refer to `the example in vLLM <https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/examples/others/lmcache/cpu_offload_lmcache.py>`__.
    See the `examples README <https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main/examples/others/lmcache#2-cpu-offload-examples>`_ to understand how to run the script for vLLM v0.

Compatibility Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This compatibility matrix accounts for dependencies as well as connector API changes. Please raise an issue on GitHub if you encounter any incompatibilities.

- 🕯️: torch version incompatibility (still compatible if using ``--no-build-isolation``)

- ❌: API incompatibility

- ✅: compatible out of the box (wheels only)

Setup using Docker
------------------

Docker Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Docker Engine 27.0+

Pre-built LMCache integrated with vLLM Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide pre-built container images of LMCache integrated with vLLM.

You can get the latest stable image as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull lmcache/vllm-openai

You can get the nightly build of latest code of LMcache and vLLM as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull lmcache/vllm-openai:latest-nightly


LMCache on ROCm
------------------

Get started through using vLLM docker image as base image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `AMD Infinity hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/vllm-dev>`__ for vLLM offers a prebuilt, optimized docker image designed for validating inference performance on the AMD Instinct™ MI300X accelerator.
The image is based on the latest vLLM v1. Please check `LLM inference performance validation on AMD Instinct MI300X <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/rocm-for-ai/inference/benchmark-docker/vllm.html?model=pyt_vllm_llama-3.1-8b>`__ for instructions on how to use this prebuilt docker image.

As of the date of writing, the steps are validated on the following environment:

- docker image: rocm/vllm-dev:nightly_0624_rc2_0624_rc2_20250620
- MI300X
- vLLM V1

.. code-block:: bash
