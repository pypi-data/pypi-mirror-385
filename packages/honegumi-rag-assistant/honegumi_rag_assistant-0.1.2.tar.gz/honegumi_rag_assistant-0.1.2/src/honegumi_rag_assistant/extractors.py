"""
Lightweight wrappers around the OpenAI function calling API used by the
Honegumi RAG Assistant.

This module defines extractor classes that use structured output via
Pydantic models and LangChain's function calling with validation for
robust parameter extraction. The :class:`ParameterExtractor` exposes
an :meth:`invoke` method that accepts a problem description and returns
a validated dictionary containing the selected Bayesian optimisation
parameters.

The structured output approach uses LangChain's with_structured_output()
which provides automatic validation, retry on validation failures, and
type coercion through Pydantic schemas.
