## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.7] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Settings reload method**: Added `settings.reload_from_env()` method to allow reloading configuration from environment variables after module import. Fixes Colab/Jupyter notebook issue where settings were cached before environment variables were set.

### Changed
- **Colab tutorial improvements**: Updated Step 5 to explicitly call `settings.reload_from_env()` and print confirmation of vector store path. Ensures vector store is properly detected in notebooks.
- **Build script error message**: Updated orchestrator error message to use `python -m honegumi_rag_assistant.build_vector_store` instead of outdated `scripts/build_vector_store.py` path.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- **Vector store Ax version pinning**: `src/honegumi_rag_assistant/build_vector_store.py` now defaults to cloning Ax v0.4.3 (matching honegumi dependency) instead of latest main branch. This prevents documentation version mismatch where LLM receives v1.x docs but generates v0.4.3 code. New `--ax-version` parameter allows specifying different versions when needed. Addresses issue raised in PR #3.
- Vector store missing condition now properly detected when path is configured but directory doesn't exist

### Changed
- **Build script location**: Moved `build_vector_store.py` from `scripts/` to `src/honegumi_rag_assistant/` to make it available as a module for pip-installed users. Usage: `python -m honegumi_rag_assistant.build_vector_store`
- **Retrieval UX improvements**: Simplified retrieval output to show only essential information. In non-debug mode, displays "Planning X parallel retrievals..." followed by success message with context count and timing, or clear error if vector store missing. Removes verbose query details and individual retriever timings from default output.
- **Vector store metadata**: Build script now saves `metadata.json` with build details including Ax version, build date, chunk configuration, and document counts for better provenance tracking.
- Removed verbose per-query retrieval details from non-debug output
- Cleaner success message: "âœ“ Retrieved X contexts in Y.XXs"

### Added
- Clear warning when vector store is not found: prompts user to build it
- Vector store path existence check before attempting retrieval

## [0.1.5] - 2025-10-20

### Changed
- Simplified ReadTheDocs navigation structure (removed unnecessary sections)
- Reduced documentation table of contents depth from 2 to 1 for cleaner appearance
- Removed License and Authors pages from main navigation

## [0.1.3] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Moved `build_vector_store.py` from `scripts/` to `src/honegumi_rag_assistant/` for pip package accessibility
- Configured PyPI to use `README_PYPI.md` for concise package description
- ReadTheDocs configuration with Google-style docstring support
- Sphinx ReadTheDocs theme
- Napoleon extension configured for Google docstrings

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Google Colab tutorial notebook (`notebooks/honegumi_rag_colab_tutorial.ipynb`)
- `README_PYPI.md` for PyPI package page
- PyPI badges to `README.md` (Colab, Issues, Discussions, Last Commit)
- "Google Colab Tutorial" section in README.md
- "Feedback & Feature Requests" section in README.md
- `requirements.txt` with exact version pinning for reproducibility

### Changed
- Updated `setup.cfg` with all dependencies using exact versions (`==`)
- Added console script entry point: `honegumi-rag` command
- Enhanced README.md with comprehensive installation and usage instructions
- Colab notebook uses programmatic API only (CLI doesn't work interactively)

### Fixed
