  purpose: Self-validation of ADRI dimension score audit logs
  usage: 'This standard validates dimension score JSONL logs to ensure:

    1. All 5 ADRI dimensions are properly logged

    2. Scores are within valid ranges (0-20)

    3. Assessment IDs properly link to main audit log

    4. Pass/fail status is correctly recorded

    5. Issue counts are non-negative

    '
  validation_notes: '- Each assessment should have exactly 5 dimension score entries

    - dimension_name must be one of the 5 ADRI dimensions

    - dimension_score must be 0-20

    - details field contains JSON with score, max_score, percentage

    - assessment_id links to corresponding entry in main audit log
