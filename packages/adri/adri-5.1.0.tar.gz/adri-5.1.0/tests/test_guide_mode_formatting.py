"""Test suite for guide mode output formatting.

This module validates guide mode formatting across different environments:
- Progressive output timing (interactive vs non-interactive)
- Visual formatting (box drawing, emoji, tables)
- Step numbering and content completeness
- Cross-terminal compatibility
- Output works when piped/redirected
