# ADRILogReader Workflow Orchestration Integration Guide

**For Workflow Engine and Runner Teams**
**Date**: October 13, 2025
**ADRI Version**: 4.3.0+

## Overview

ADRILogReader has been extended with workflow orchestration methods specifically designed for integration with workflow engines like WorkflowEngine. These methods enable efficient querying of JSONL audit logs for monitoring, incremental processing, and assessment tracking.

## What's New

Three new methods and three property aliases have been added to `ADRILogReader`:

### New Methods

1. **`get_latest_assessment_id()`** - Quick access to the most recent assessment
2. **`get_assessments_since(timestamp)`** - Time-based filtering for incremental processing
3. **`read_assessment_by_id(assessment_id)`** - Direct lookup by assessment ID

### Property Aliases (Backward Compatibility)

- `assessment_logs_path` (alias for `assessment_log_path`)
- `dimension_scores_path` (alias for `dimension_score_path`)
- `failed_validations_path` (alias for `failed_validation_path`)

## Why These Methods?

These methods directly address WorkflowEngine integration requirements:

- **Lines 1475, 1541**: Need `get_latest_assessment_id()` for monitoring
- **Line 1514**: Need `get_assessments_since(timestamp)` for incremental processing
- **Lines 1522, 1543**: Need `read_assessment_by_id(assessment_id)` for details lookup
- **Lines 1688-1690**: Need plural property names for path access

## Quick Start

```python
from adri.logging import ADRILogReader

# Initialize reader with config
config = {
    "paths": {
        "audit_logs": "ADRI/dev/audit-logs"  # or ADRI/prod/audit-logs
    }
}
reader = ADRILogReader(config)

# Get latest assessment ID
latest_id = reader.get_latest_assessment_id()
# Returns: "adri_20251013_143000_abc123" or None if no logs

# Get full assessment details
if latest_id:
    assessment = reader.read_assessment_by_id(latest_id)
    print(f"Score: {assessment['overall_score']}")
    print(f"Passed: {assessment['passed']}")

# Get assessments since last check
new_assessments = reader.get_assessments_since("2025-10-13T14:00:00")
for assessment in new_assessments:
    print(f"New assessment: {assessment['assessment_id']}")
```

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Continuous Monitoring

Monitor for new assessments and process them as they arrive.

```python
from adri.logging import ADRILogReader
import time
from datetime import datetime, timezone

reader = ADRILogReader(config)
last_check = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()

while True:
    # Get new assessments since last check
    new_assessments = reader.get_assessments_since(last_check)

    for assessment in new_assessments:
        # Process each new assessment
        print(f"Processing: {assessment['assessment_id']}")

        if not assessment['passed']:
            # Handle failed assessment
            validations = reader.read_failed_validations(assessment['assessment_id'])
            alert_on_failure(assessment, validations)

        # Update last processed timestamp
        last_check = assessment['timestamp']

    time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute
```

### Pattern 2: Latest Assessment Health Check

Quick check of the most recent assessment status.

```python
def check_latest_assessment_health():
    reader = ADRILogReader(config)

    # Get latest assessment ID
    latest_id = reader.get_latest_assessment_id()
    if not latest_id:
        return {"status": "no_assessments", "message": "No assessments found"}

    # Get full details
    assessment = reader.read_assessment_by_id(latest_id)

    if assessment['passed']:
        return {
            "status": "healthy",
            "assessment_id": latest_id,
            "score": assessment['overall_score']
        }
    else:
        # Get failure details
        validations = reader.read_failed_validations(latest_id)
        return {
            "status": "unhealthy",
            "assessment_id": latest_id,
            "score": assessment['overall_score'],
            "issues": len(validations)
        }
```

### Pattern 3: Incremental Batch Processing

Process assessments in batches for efficiency.

```python
def process_assessments_since_last_run(last_run_timestamp):
    reader = ADRILogReader(config)

    # Get all assessments since last run
    new_assessments = reader.get_assessments_since(last_run_timestamp)

    print(f"Found {len(new_assessments)} new assessments to process")

    for assessment in new_assessments:
        # Get related data
        scores = reader.read_dimension_scores(assessment['assessment_id'])

        # Process assessment with full context
        process_assessment({
            "assessment": assessment,
            "dimension_scores": scores,
            "failed_validations": reader.read_failed_validations(assessment['assessment_id'])
                if not assessment['passed'] else []
        })

    # Return latest timestamp for next run
    if new_assessments:
        return new_assessments[-1]['timestamp']
    return last_run_timestamp
```

### Pattern 4: Assessment Detail Lookup

Retrieve full details for a specific assessment (e.g., from an alert or notification).

```python
def get_assessment_details(assessment_id):
    reader = ADRILogReader(config)

    # Get main assessment record
    assessment = reader.read_assessment_by_id(assessment_id)
    if not assessment:
        return None

    # Get all related information
    return {
        "assessment": assessment,
        "dimension_scores": reader.read_dimension_scores(assessment_id),
        "failed_validations": reader.read_failed_validations(assessment_id),
        "summary": {
            "passed": assessment['passed'],
            "score": assessment['overall_score'],
            "data_rows": assessment['data_row_count'],
            "timestamp": assessment['timestamp']
        }
    }
```

## Method Reference

### get_latest_assessment_id()

**Purpose**: Get the ID of the most recent assessment without loading full records.

**Returns**:
- `str` - Assessment ID (e.g., "adri_20251013_143000_abc123")
- `None` - If no assessments exist

**Use Cases**:
- Quick health checks
- Determining if new assessments exist
- Getting starting point for detail lookups

**Example**:
```python
latest_id = reader.get_latest_assessment_id()
if latest_id:
    print(f"Latest assessment: {latest_id}")
```

---

### get_assessments_since(timestamp)

**Purpose**: Get all assessments that occurred after a specific timestamp.

**Parameters**:
- `timestamp` (str) - ISO format timestamp (e.g., "2025-10-13T14:00:00")

**Returns**:
- `List[AssessmentLogRecord]` - Assessments with timestamp > provided value
- Empty list if no matches

**Use Cases**:
- Incremental processing
- "What changed since last check"
- Time-based filtering

**Important Notes**:
- Uses `>` comparison (excludes exact timestamp match)
- Results sorted by `write_seq` for stable ordering
- All timestamps are ISO format strings

**Example**:
```python
# Get assessments from the last hour
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
one_hour_ago = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=1)).isoformat()
recent = reader.get_assessments_since(one_hour_ago)
print(f"Found {len(recent)} assessments in last hour")
```

---

### read_assessment_by_id(assessment_id)

**Purpose**: Retrieve complete assessment details for a specific ID.

**Parameters**:
- `assessment_id` (str) - Assessment identifier (e.g., "adri_20251013_143000_abc123")

**Returns**:
- `AssessmentLogRecord` (dict) - Full assessment record if found
- `None` - If assessment ID not found

**Use Cases**:
- Lookup from notifications/alerts
- Drill-down from summaries
- Detailed investigation

**Important Notes**:
- Case-sensitive matching
- Returns first match (IDs should be unique)
- Includes all assessment fields

**Example**:
```python
assessment = reader.read_assessment_by_id("adri_20251013_143000_abc123")
if assessment:
    print(f"Passed: {assessment['passed']}")
    print(f"Score: {assessment['overall_score']}")
    print(f"Rows: {assessment['data_row_count']}")
```

## Data Structures

### AssessmentLogRecord

```python
{
    "assessment_id": str,          # e.g., "adri_20251013_143000_abc123"
    "timestamp": str,              # ISO format: "2025-10-13T14:30:00"
    "adri_version": str,           # e.g., "4.3.0"
    "overall_score": float,        # e.g., 85.5
    "passed": bool,                # Native boolean: true/false
    "data_row_count": int,
    "data_column_count": int,
    "data_columns": list,          # Native array of strings
    "write_seq": int,              # Ordering field
    # ... many more fields
}
```

### DimensionScoreRecord

```python
{
    "assessment_id": str,
    "dimension_name": str,         # e.g., "completeness", "validity"
    "dimension_score": float,
    "dimension_passed": bool,
    "issues_found": int,
    "details": dict,               # Native JSON object
    "write_seq": int
}
```

### FailedValidationRecord

```python
{
    "assessment_id": str,
    "validation_id": str,
    "dimension": str,
    "field_name": str,
    "issue_type": str,
    "affected_rows": int,
    "affected_percentage": float,
    "sample_failures": list,       # Native array
    "remediation": str,
    "write_seq": int
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Line-by-line reading**: Efficient for large log files
- **Write sequence ordering**: Stable, deterministic results
- **Thread-safe**: Read-only operations, safe for concurrent access
- **No external dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
- **Graceful degradation**: Returns empty lists/None for missing files

## Error Handling

All methods handle errors gracefully:

```python
# Missing log files
reader = ADRILogReader({"paths": {"audit_logs": "/nonexistent/path"}})
latest = reader.get_latest_assessment_id()  # Returns None (not an error)

# Malformed JSONL lines
# Skipped with warning, processing continues

# Empty results
assessments = reader.get_assessments_since("2099-01-01T00:00:00")
# Returns [] (empty list)
```

## Migration Notes

If you're currently using WorkflowEngine with older log reading code:

### Before (hypothetical old code):
```python
# Old approach - reading CSV or custom code
latest_log = parse_csv_logs(log_path)[-1]
latest_id = latest_log['assessment_id']
```

### After (new approach):
```python
# New approach - using ADRILogReader
reader = ADRILogReader(config)
latest_id = reader.get_latest_assessment_id()
```

## Configuration

Standard ADRI configuration file (`ADRI/config.yaml`):

```yaml
paths:
  audit_logs: "./ADRI/dev/audit-logs"  # Development
  # or
  audit_logs: "./ADRI/prod/audit-logs"  # Production
```
