## What is ADRI?

**ADRI** (Agent Data Readiness Index) is the missing data layer for AI agents.

It's an open-source Python framework that protects AI agent workflows from bad data by automatically validating data quality. With a single decorator, ADRI:

- Auto-generates quality standards from good data
- Validates data across 5 dimensions (validity, completeness, consistency, accuracy, timeliness)
- Blocks or warns on quality failures
- Logs insights locally for debugging

**Key insight**: AI agents are powerful but fragile. One malformed field or missing value can crash your entire workflow. ADRI learns what good data looks like and enforces it automatically.

## Why use ADRI?

### Problem: Data Quality is the #1 Agent Killer

Traditional approaches to data validation are tedious and error-prone:
- Writing dozens of `if` statements
- Manually checking every field type
- Hoping you caught all edge cases
- Debugging mysterious agent failures

### Solution: One Decorator, Complete Protection

```python
@adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data")
def process_customers(data):
    return results
```

**Benefits:**
1. **2-minute integration** - Add decorator, done
2. **Zero configuration** - Auto-learns from your data
3. **Framework agnostic** - Works with any Python function
4. **Developer-friendly** - Local logging, clear errors
5. **Production-ready** - Block bad data before it causes issues

## How does auto-generation work?

ADRI's auto-generation is magic that works like this:

### First Run with Good Data

```python
@adri_protected(standard="customer_data", data_param="customers")
def process_customers(customers):
    return analyze(customers)

# Run with clean data
good_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3],
    "email": ["user@example.com", ...],
    "age": [25, 30, 35]
})

process_customers(good_data)  # ✅ Generates standard
```

### What ADRI Learns

ADRI analyzes your data and learns:

1. **Field names**: `id`, `email`, `age`
2. **Data types**: integer, string, integer
3. **Patterns**: Email format for `email` field
4. **Ranges**: Age between 25-35 (with buffer)
5. **Required fields**: All fields present = all required

### Standard Generation

Creates `ADRI/dev/standards/process_customers_customers_standard.yaml`:

```yaml
standard:
  name: "process_customers_customers"
  version: "1.0.0"
  
  fields:
    id:
      type: integer
      required: true
      min_value: 1
    
    email:
      type: string
      required: true
      pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    
    age:
      type: integer
      required: true
      min_value: 0
      max_value: 120
```

### Future Runs

All subsequent runs validate against this standard:

```python
bad_data = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [None, 2, 3],  # Missing ID
    "email": ["invalid", ...],  # Bad email
    "age": [-5, 30, 35]  # Negative age
})

process_customers(bad_data)  # ❌ Raises exception
```

**Customize it**: Edit the YAML to tighten/loosen rules as needed.

## What's the difference between block and warn modes?

ADRI offers two guard modes:

### Block Mode (Default)

**Behavior**: Raises exception on quality failure

```python
@adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data", on_failure="raise")
def strict_function(data):
    return results  # Won't execute if data is bad
```

**Use when:**
- Production environments
- Data quality is critical
- Bad data would cause errors
- You want to fail fast

**Output:**
```python
DataQualityException: Data quality too low (67.3/100, required: 80.0/100)
- Validity: 3 invalid types
- Completeness: 2 missing fields
```

### Warn Mode

**Behavior**: Logs warning, continues execution

```python
@adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data", on_failure="warn")
def lenient_function(data):
    return results  # Executes even with bad data
```

**Use when:**
- Development and testing
- You want visibility without disruption
- Quality issues are acceptable
- Graceful degradation preferred

**Output:**
```
⚠️  WARNING: Data quality low (67.3/100)
⚠️  Executing despite quality issues (warn mode)
```

### Choosing the Right Mode

```python
import os

# Environment-based mode selection
MODE = "warn" if os.getenv("ENV") == "dev" else "block"

@adri_protected(data_param="data", mode=MODE)
def flexible_function(data):
    return results
```

## Can I customize standards?

**Yes!** Standards are human-readable YAML files you can edit.

### Location

Generated standards are saved to:
```
ADRI/dev/standards/your_function_data_standard.yaml
```

### Customization Examples

**1. Tighten age range:**
```yaml
age:
  type: integer
  min_value: 18  # Was: 0
  max_value: 100  # Was: 120
```

**2. Add email validation:**
```yaml
email:
  type: string
  required: true
  pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
  max_length: 255  # Added
```

**3. Add timeliness check:**
```yaml
signup_date:
  type: date
  required: true
  max_age_days: 365  # Must be within last year
```

**4. Add cross-field validation:**
```yaml
rules:
  - name: "End after start"
    expression: "end_date > start_date"
    severity: "critical"
```

### Version Standards

Bump version when making changes:

```yaml
standard:
  name: "customer_data"
  version: "2.0.0"  # Was: 1.0.0
  changelog:
    - "2.0.0: Added email max_length"
    - "1.0.0: Initial version"
```

## What frameworks does ADRI work with?

**All of them.** ADRI is framework-agnostic.

### Officially Tested

- ✅ LangChain
- ✅ LangGraph
- ✅ CrewAI
- ✅ AutoGen
- ✅ LlamaIndex
- ✅ Haystack
- ✅ Semantic Kernel
- ✅ Generic Python functions

### How It Works

ADRI protects **Python functions**, not frameworks:

```python
# Works with ANY framework
@adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data")
def your_function(data):
    return framework_specific_logic(data)
```

### Examples

See [Framework Patterns](FRAMEWORK_PATTERNS.md) for integration patterns, or [examples/](../examples/) for working code.

## Why is ADRI open source?

ADRI is open source because **data quality is a fundamental challenge** that the entire AI agent community should solve together.

### Our Philosophy

**Data quality is infrastructure, not competitive advantage.** Just like:
- **HTTP** is open (everyone benefits)
- **PostgreSQL** is open (database foundation)
- **Linux** is open (operating system base)

**ADRI should be open** (data quality foundation).

### Why Open Source Benefits You

1. **No vendor lock-in** - Use ADRI without contracts or negotiations
2. **Community-driven** - Improvements from engineers solving real problems
3. **Transparent** - See exactly how validation works
4. **Customizable** - Fork and modify for your specific needs
5. **Free** - No licensing fees, ever

### Why Open Source Benefits Everyone

1. **Standards adoption** - Open standards become industry standards
2. **Framework integration** - All frameworks can adopt ADRI
3. **Collective intelligence** - Best practices emerge from community
4. **Faster innovation** - More contributors = faster improvements

### The Business Model

## Performance Questions

### How fast is ADRI?

**Very fast.** Validation adds minimal overhead:

- **Simple datasets (<1K rows)**: <10ms overhead
- **Medium datasets (1K-100K rows)**: 10-100ms overhead
- **Large datasets (100K+ rows)**: 100ms-1s overhead

### Does ADRI slow down my agents?

**Barely.** For most use cases, ADRI's validation is negligible compared to:
- LLM API calls (100ms-10s)
- Database queries (10ms-1s)
- Network requests (50ms-5s)

**Example:**
```
Without ADRI: 2.5s total
With ADRI: 2.52s total (+20ms, or +0.8%)
```

### Can I disable ADRI in production?

You can, but **you shouldn't**. ADRI is designed for production use.

If you must:
```python
import os

# Skip validation in specific environments
SKIP_VALIDATION = os.getenv("SKIP_ADRI") == "true"

if not SKIP_VALIDATION:
    @adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data")
    def process(data):
        return results
```

### How does ADRI handle large datasets?

ADRI samples large datasets for validation:

- **Sampling strategy**: Representative sampling
- **Default sample size**: 10,000 rows
- **Configurable**: Adjust sample size in config

```yaml
# .adri/config.yaml
validation:
  sample_size: 5000  # For faster validation
  # sample_size: null  # Validate all rows
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Standard not found"

**Problem**: ADRI can't find the standard file.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run once with good data to generate standard
python your_script.py

# Or generate manually
adri generate-standard good_data.csv --name your_standard
```

### "Quality score too low"

**Problem**: Data doesn't meet quality threshold.

**Solutions**:
1. **Fix the data** (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Check detailed report
   adri assess data.csv --standard my_standard --show-details
   ```

2. **Lower threshold** (if appropriate):
   ```python
   @adri_protected(data_param="data", min_score=70.0)
   ```

3. **Use warn mode** (for development):
   ```python
   @adri_protected(standard="data", data_param="data", on_failure="warn")
   ```

### "Import error"

**Problem**: Can't import ADRI.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Reinstall
pip install --upgrade adri

# Check installation
python -c "import adri; print(adri.__version__)"
```

### "Standard keeps regenerating"

**Problem**: Standard regenerates on every run.

**Cause**: Standard file not being saved or found.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if standard exists
ls ADRI/dev/standards/

# Specify standard explicitly
@adri_protected(data_param="data", standard="my_standard")
```

### "Performance is slow"

**Problem**: Validation takes too long.

**Solutions**:
1. **Enable sampling**:
   ```yaml
   # .adri/config.yaml
   validation:
     sample_size: 5000
   ```

2. **Cache standards**:
   ```python
   # Standards are cached by default
   # Ensure you're not regenerating on every run
   ```

3. **Profile your code**:
   ```bash
   python -m cProfile -s time your_script.py
   ```
