## What is VARWG?

VARWG is a single-site Vector-Autoregressive weather generator that was developed for hydrodynamic and ecologic modelling of lakes. It includes a number of possibilities to define climate scenarios. For example, changes in mean or in the variability of air temperature can be set. Correlations during simulations are preserved, so that these changes propagate from the air temperature to the other simulated variables.

## About the Name Change

The project was renamed from **VG** to **VARWG** because there is already a different package named `vg` on PyPI. To avoid conflicts and ensure the package is properly discoverable on PyPI, we adopted the more descriptive name **VARWG** (Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator). For backward compatibility, the old `VG` class name is still available as an alias, so existing code will continue to work without modifications.

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install varwg
```

Pre-built wheels are available for:
- **Linux**: x86_64
- **Windows**: AMD64
- **macOS**: x86_64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon)

No compiler needed! If a wheel isn't available for your platform, pip will automatically build from source (requires C compiler and Cython).

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iskur/varwg.git
cd varwg
pip install -e .
```

Building from source requires:
- C compiler (gcc/clang/MSVC)
- Cython >= 3.1.1
- NumPy >= 1.26.0

## Quick Start

After installation, you can use VARWG to generate synthetic weather data:

```python
import varwg as vg

# Configure VARWG with default settings
vg.set_conf(vg.config_template)

# Define meteorological variables to simulate
var_names = ("theta", "Qsw", "rh")  # Temperature, solar radiation, humidity

# Initialize the weather generator with sample data
met_vg = vg.VG(var_names, met_file=vg.sample_met, refit=True, verbose=True)

# Fit the seasonal VAR model
met_vg.fit(p=3, seasonal=True)

# Simulate 10 years of daily weather data
sim_times, sim_data = met_vg.simulate(T=10*365)

# Visualize results
met_vg.plot_meteogram_daily()
met_vg.plot_autocorr()
```

See the `scripts/` directory for more advanced examples.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Or install test dependencies and run:

```bash
uv sync --group test
uv run pytest
```

## Documentation

The documentation can be accessed online at
<https://varwg.readthedocs.io>.

<!-- The source package also ships with the sphinx-based documentation source -->
<!-- in the `doc` folder. Having [sphinx](sphinx.pocoo.org) installed, it can -->
<!-- be built by typing: -->

<!--     make html -->

<!-- inside the `doc` folder. -->
