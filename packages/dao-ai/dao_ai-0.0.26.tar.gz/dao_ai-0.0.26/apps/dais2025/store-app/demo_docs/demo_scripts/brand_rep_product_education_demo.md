## **Demo Summary**

This demo shows a store associate preparing for and participating in a brand representative education session using Databricks-powered AI to maximize learning and sales readiness.

## **Industry Problem** *(30 seconds)*

"Retail associates receive dozens of product trainings each quarter, but 70% of that information is forgotten within a week. Brand representatives deliver generic presentations that don't connect to local customer preferences or sales patterns. Associates struggle to translate product features into relevant customer benefits because they lack insights into who actually buys these products and why. This leads to missed sales opportunities and associates who can't confidently recommend products they've been trained on."
