## **Demo Summary**

This demo shows a store associate using Databricks-powered AI to transform a potential lost sale into exceptional customer service.

## **Industry Problem** *(30 seconds)*

"Retail associates spend 60% of their time on manual tasks - checking inventory, calling other stores, and coordinating fulfillment. When customers want specific products that aren't immediately available, associates often can't access the complete picture across all locations and channels because critical information is scattered across multiple disconnected systems. This leads to lost sales, frustrated customers, and associates who feel powerless to help."

## **Demo Scenario: Turning Stock-Outs into Sales** *(2 minutes)*

**Setup**: It's a busy Saturday afternoon at BrickMart's Downtown Market location. Store associate Sarah is working the footwear section when a customer approaches looking for black Adidas Gazelle sneakers that are out of stock. Instead of disappointing the customer, Sarah demonstrates how unified data access transforms customer service.

**What You'll See**: In under 3 minutes, watch how the BrickMart Companion app transforms a potential lost sale into an exceptional customer experience using real-time AI capabilities powered by the Databricks Lakehouse Platform.

## Demo Flow

### **Step 1: Intelligent Inventory Discovery** *(30 seconds)*
**Customer**: "Do you have black Adidas Gazelle sneakers?"

**Sarah**: *[Types into AI app]* "Check inventory for black Adidas Gazelles at Downtown Market."

**AI Response**: "Out of stock here, but we have navy (15 pairs) and grey (9 pairs) in Aisle 5A. Next black shipment: March 18th."

**Key Demo Points**: 
*"Notice how Sarah instantly knows not just what's out of stock, but what alternatives are available and exactly where to find them. Without unified data, she'd be making phone calls or disappointing customers. This is real-time intelligence at the point of sale."*

### **Step 2: AI-Powered Product Recommendations** *(30 seconds)*
**Customer**: "What's similar to the black Gazelles?"

**Sarah**: *[Types]* "Recommend similar sneakers we have in stock."

**AI Response**: "Top alternatives in stock:
- Adidas Samba Classic (Black/White) - $94.99, Aisle 5A
- Adidas Superstar (Black/White) - $99.99, Aisle 5A
Both have similar retro styling and customer ratings."

**Key Demo Points**: 
*"Watch how AI doesn't just suggest random products - it understands style, price point, and customer preferences. This demonstrates intelligent product matching using unified catalog data. Sarah becomes a style expert powered by data science."*

### **Step 3: Cross-Location Intelligence** *(30 seconds)*
**Customer**: "I really want the black Gazelles specifically."

**Sarah**: *[Types]* "Check nearby stores for black Gazelles."

**AI Response**: "Found at 2 locations:
- **Marina Market**: 12 pairs, 2.1 miles, open until 10 PM
- **Mission Market**: 18 pairs, 2.8 miles, open until 11 PM"

**Key Demo Points**: 
*"One query just searched every store in the network. Sarah can see real-time inventory, distances, and store hours instantly. This is how unified data transforms a potential lost sale into a satisfied customer - no phone calls, no guesswork."*

### **Step 4: Automated Service Orchestration** *(30 seconds)*
**Customer**: "Hold a size 10 at Marina Market for me."

**Sarah**: *[Types]* "Place a hold for size 10 black Gazelles at Marina Market."

**AI Response**: "Hold placed! I can also:
- Send store directions to customer's phone
- Set up restock notifications for Downtown Market"

**Key Demo Points**: 
*"One request just triggered coordination across multiple systems - inventory hold, customer notification, and proactive follow-up. What used to require multiple phone calls and manual tracking now happens automatically. This is intelligent workflow orchestration in action."*
