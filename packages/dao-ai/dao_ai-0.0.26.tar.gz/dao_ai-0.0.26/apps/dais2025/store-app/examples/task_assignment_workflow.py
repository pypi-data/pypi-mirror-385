Task Assignment Workflow Example

This script demonstrates the complete workflow for:
1. Finding the top employee in a department
2. Identifying their manager
3. Assigning a task to that employee through their manager
4. Tracking the assignment

This showcases the integration between employee performance tools and task assignment tools.
