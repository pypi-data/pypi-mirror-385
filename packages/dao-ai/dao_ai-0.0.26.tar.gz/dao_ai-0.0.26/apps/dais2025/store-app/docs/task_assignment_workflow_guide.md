# Task Assignment Workflow Guide

This guide explains how to use the task assignment workflow tools to automatically assign tasks to top performing employees through their managers, with mock notification functionality.

## Overview

The task assignment workflow enables AI agents to:
1. **Identify Top Performers**: Find the best employees in specific departments
2. **Locate Managers**: Identify manager contact information and preferences
3. **Create Task Assignments**: Generate structured task assignments with tracking
4. **Send Notifications**: Mock notification system for manager communication
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor assignment status and completion

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Find Top Employee
```python
# Find the best employee in a department
top_employees = find_top_employees_by_department.invoke({
    "department": "Customer Service",
    "limit": 1
})

best_employee = top_employees[0]
# Returns: Emma Rodriguez (EMP-007) - Performance Score: 4.90, Rank #1
```

### Step 2: Identify Manager
```python
# Find the employee's manager
manager_info = find_employee_manager.invoke({
    "employee_id": best_employee["employee_id"]
})

manager = manager_info[0]
# Returns: Robert Chen (MGR-001) - robert.chen@brickmart.com, Slack: U01ROBERT
```

### Step 3: Assign Task
```python
# Create task assignment through manager
assignment_result = assign_task_to_employee.invoke({
    "employee_id": "EMP-007",
    "task_title": "Handle VIP Customer Complaint Resolution",
    "task_description": "Priority customer complaint needs immediate attention...",
    "task_type": "priority",
    "priority_level": "high",
    "due_hours": 2,
    "estimated_duration_minutes": 90
})

# Returns assignment ID, manager notification details, and tracking info
```

## Database Schema

### New Tables Created

#### `managers` Table
Stores manager information and contact preferences:
- Manager identification and contact details
- Communication preferences (email, Slack, Teams, phone)
- Work schedules and availability
- Task assignment preferences and limits

#### `task_assignments` Table
Tracks all task assignment requests and their status:
- Assignment identification and details
- Employee and manager information
- Task specifications and timing
- Status tracking (pending, approved, in_progress, completed)
- Communication and notification logs
- Performance context and selection reasoning

### Views Created

#### `manager_employee_lookup`
Joins managers with their employees for easy lookup:
```sql
SELECT manager_info.*, employee_performance.*
FROM managers m
JOIN employee_performance e ON m.manager_id = e.manager_id
```

#### `active_task_assignments`
Shows current active assignments:
```sql
SELECT * FROM task_assignments 
WHERE assignment_status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'in_progress')
```

#### `manager_task_dashboard`
Manager performance dashboard:
```sql
SELECT manager_id, total_assignments, pending_approvals, 
       avg_completion_quality, avg_completion_time
FROM task_assignments
GROUP BY manager_id
```

## Mock Notification System

The system includes a mock notification framework that simulates real-world communication:

### Supported Communication Methods
- **Email**: Sends to manager's email address
- **Slack**: Messages manager's Slack user ID
- **Teams**: Notifies via Microsoft Teams
- **Phone**: Simulates phone notification

### Notification Content
Each notification includes:
- Task title and description
- Priority level and due date
- Employee selection reasoning
- Assignment ID for tracking
- Manager approval request

### Example Notification (Slack)
