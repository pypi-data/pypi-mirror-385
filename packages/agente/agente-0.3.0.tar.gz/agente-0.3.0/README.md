# agente

A very simple Python framework for building AI Agents. 

## Overview

Agente is a Python framework that allows you to create AI agents just like you create Python classes and methods. 

Each method can be converted to into a function calling tool using a simple decorator. This allow you to think the tools as regular class methods within the instante namespace of the agent. 

Multi-agent orchestration is supported in an hierarchical way, starting from a main agent that can delegate tasks to specialized agents. 


## Features

- Simple agent creation and easily **customizable**
- Support for **streaming** responses
- **Multi-agent** orchestration (hierarchical)
- **Autonomous agent tool**  that allows an agent to create its own tools (experimental)

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
pip install agente
```

For running the examples with Gradio UI:

```bash
pip install agente[examples]
```

**Note:** The frameworks works on top of litellm, so you need to set your provider API key in the environment variables.


## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of creating a conversational agent:

```python
import os 
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key" #load your provider API key
from agente.core.base import BaseAgent


class SimpleAgent(BaseAgent):
    agent_name: str = "SimpleAgent"
    system_prompt: str = "You are a helpful AI assistant."
    silent: bool = True #while running the agent, it will not print execution logs
    completion_kwargs: dict = {
        "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
        "stream": False,
        "temperature": 1.0,
        "max_tokens": 500,
    }

# Create agent instance
agent = SimpleAgent()

# Add a message
agent.add_message(role = "user", content =  "Tell me a joke about programming.")

# Run the agent and get responses
responses = await agent.run()

# by default the response have litellm format
print(responses[0].choices[0].message.content)
```

### Using agente response format

```python
# Add a message
agent.add_message(role = "user", content =  "Another one, please.")

# Now with agente response format
responses = await agent.run(output_format = "agente")

print(responses[0].content)
```


### To access the conversation history
```python

conversation_history = agent.conv_history

print(conversation_history.model_dump())
```

### To access the logs
```python
# Get the logs
logs = agent.log_calls
print(logs)

logs = agent.log_completions
print(logs)
```



## Advanced Usage

### Adding Tools

Agents can be enhanced with tools using the `@function_tool` decorator. The decorator will automatically generate a tool schema for the function based on the docstring and the `Annotated` type hints.

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key" #load your provider API key
from agente.core.base import BaseAgent
from agente.core.decorators import function_tool
from typing import Annotated

class AddAgent(BaseAgent):
    agent_name: str = "add_agent"

    @function_tool
    async def calculate_sum(self, a: Annotated[int,"The first number"], b: Annotated[int,"The second number"]) -> int:
        """Calculate the sum of two numbers."""
        return a + b

agent = AddAgent()
agent.completion_kwargs['model'] = 'gpt-4.1-mini'
agent.add_message(role = "user", content = "How much is 10 + 10?")
responses = await agent.run()
print(responses[-1].choices[0].message.content)
```

### Creating Multi-Agent Systems

You can create complex multi-agent systems where agents can call other agents using the `@agent_tool` decorator. 

For now the framework was designed to work with a hierarchical structure, where a main agent can call other specialized agents that can call other agents and so on. These sub-agents must be `TaskAgents` that inherit from `BaseTaskAgent` and must have a `complete_task` method that returns the result of the task.

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key" #load your provider API key
from agente.core.base import BaseAgent,BaseTaskAgent
from agente.core.decorators import function_tool,agent_tool
import random

class JokeTeller(BaseTaskAgent):
    agent_name: str = "JokeTeller"
    system_prompt:str = "Your task is to write a funny joke."
    completion_kwargs: dict = {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "stream": False,
    }

    @function_tool
    def task_completed(self,joke:Annotated[str,"The joke to return"]):
        """To be used as a tool to complete the task."""
        return joke



class MainAgent(BaseAgent):
    agent_name: str = "main_agent"
    
    @function_tool(next_tool = "get_joke") # To make sure the agent calls the get_joke tool we add the next_tool argument to force it.
    def random_topic(self):
        """Tool to get a random topic.
        """
        topics = ["programming","science","animals","food","sports"]
        topic = random.choice(topics)

        return topic


    @agent_tool()
    def get_joke(self,joke_topic:Annotated[str,"The topic of the joke"]):
        """Tool to get a joke."""
        joke_agent = JokeTeller()
        joke_agent.add_message(role = "user", content = "Tell me a joke about " + joke_topic)
        return joke_agent
    
example_agent = MainAgent()
example_agent.add_message(role = "user", content = "Call the tool random_topic to get a random topic and then tell  me a joke about it")
responses = await example_agent.run()
print(responses[-1].choices[0].message.content)
```
