## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
**PyAiraHome** is a comprehensive Python library that enables developers to access Aira Home devices. The library provides seamless integration with Aira's cloud infrastructure via secure **gRPC services**, enabling remote monitoring, control, and data retrieval from anywhere with internet connectivity. Additionally, it offers direct **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** communication for local device interaction, better data coverage and complete with message encryption for secure data exchange.

PyAiraHome features an intuitive **object-oriented API** that supports both raw protobuf responses and convenient Python dictionaries, comprehensive error handling, and detailed type annotations.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. If you prefer an already working system check [AiraHome-Dashboard](https://github.com/invy55/airahome-dashboard) out.

### Prerequisites

- **Internet connection** - Required for cloud-based features and authentication
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capability** - Required for local device communication and full data coverage (ensure you're within range of your Aira Brain)

### Installation

Install PyAiraHome directly from PyPI using pip:

```shell
$ pip install pyairahome
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Quick Start

Here's a basic example showing cloud functionality:

```python
from pyairahome import AiraHome

# Initialize the library
aira = AiraHome()

# Cloud authentication
aira.cloud.login_with_credentials("email@example.com", "password")

# Get device information
devices = aira.cloud.get_devices()
device_id = devices["devices"][0]["id"]["value"]
print(f"Found device: {device_id}")

# Get current device state
states = aira.cloud.get_states(device_id)
print(f"Current temperature: {states['heat_pump_states'][0]['current_hot_water_temperature']}")
```

### Cloud API Examples

#### Authentication and Device Management

```python
# Login with credentials
aira.cloud.login_with_credentials("email@example.com", "password")

# Alternative: Login with existing tokens
# aira.cloud.login_with_tokens("id_token", "access_token", "refresh_token")

# List all devices
devices = aira.cloud.get_devices()
print(f"Found {len(devices['devices'])} devices")

# Get detailed device information
device_details = aira.cloud.get_device_details(device_id)
print(f"Device name: {device_details['name']}")
```

#### Monitoring and Control

```python
# Get current device states
states = aira.cloud.get_states(device_id)
print(states)

# Send commands to device
command_result = aira.cloud.send_command(device_id, "Ping")
command_id = command_result['command_id']['value']

# Monitor command progress
for update in aira.cloud.stream_command_progress(command_id):
    print(f"Command status: {update}")
```

### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Examples

#### Device Discovery and Connection

```python
# Discover nearby Aira devices
devices = aira.ble.discover(timeout=5)
print(f"Found {len(devices)} BLE devices")

# Connect to a specific device by UUID
connected = aira.ble.connect_uuid("your-device-uuid-here")
if connected:
    print("Successfully connected via BLE")
    
    # Get device configuration
    config = aira.ble.get_configuration()
    print(f"Device configuration: {config}")
else:
    print("Failed to connect")
```

#### Working with Raw vs Processed Data

```python
# Get processed data (Python dictionaries)
devices = aira.cloud.get_devices(raw=False)  # Default
print(type(devices))  # <class 'dict'>

# Get raw protobuf data
devices_raw = aira.cloud.get_devices(raw=True)
print(type(devices_raw))  # <class 'pyairahome.device.v1.devices_pb2.GetDevicesResponse'>
```

### Complete Example

```python
from pyairahome import AiraHome
import time

# Initialize and authenticate
aira = AiraHome()
aira.cloud.login_with_credentials("email@example.com", "password")

# Get device information
devices = aira.cloud.get_devices()
if devices["devices"]:
    device_id = devices["devices"][0]["id"]["value"]
    print(f"Working with device: {device_id}")
    
    # Try BLE connection for enhanced data
    try:
        connected = aira.init_ble()
        if connected:
            print("BLE connection established - enhanced data available")
            additional = aira.ble.get_system_check_state()
            print(f"Additional system states: {additional}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"BLE connection failed: {e}")
        print("Continuing with cloud-only mode...")
    
    # Monitor device state
    states = aira.cloud.get_states(device_id)
    print(f"Device status: {states}")
    
else:
    print("No devices found")
```

> **Note**: Replace `"email@example.com"` and `"password"` with your actual Aira Home credentials. For BLE functionality, ensure you're within range of your Aira Brain.

## üìã Todo(s) <a name = "todo"></a>

- [ ] Implement BLE commands functionality
- [ ] Replace short comments with more exhaustive ones
- [ ] Create an actual documentation with more examples
