#  Synthesized's Scientific Data Kit (SDK)

The SDK generates high quality, privacy-preserving datasets for machine learning and data science use cases.
It's available on PyPi for a free 30-day trial.

## Usage

A licence key is required to use the full version of the package.
If you don't have one, a free 30-day trial licence key will be provided during the installation.
See the [comparison table](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/user_guide/install#comparison) in the
[documentation](https://docs.synthesized.io/home/) for details about the features included in the trial.

Please [contact us](https://www.synthesized.io/contact-us) for more information about obtaining a full licence key.

## Installation

It is assumed that you have Python 3.8+ already installed on a Windows, Linux, or MacOS machine.

Before starting, ensure that `pip` and `wheel` are installed and up to date.

```shell
pip install -U pip wheel
```

Synthesized can then be installed directly with `pip`.

```shell
pip install synthesized
```


## Setting the licence key

Once you have installed the package, you'll need a licence key to run the
software. The quickest way to check if the SDK is working is by running the
command:

```shell
synth-validate
```

The first time this is run you will be asked if you have a licence key. If you
do not have one simply select "no" and the prompts will guide you in acquiring
one by entering your email address.

Once you have set your licence key, the SDK will briefly verify the
installation was successful.

With the SDK installed you are now able to get synthesizing! Check out our
[quick start](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/user_guide/tutorials/quickstart) or
[user guides](https://docs.synthesized.io/sdk/latest/user_guide/) for
ways that the SDK can be put to use.


## Dependencies

Below are the minimum dependencies required to run the SDK.
