# Shared object cache for multi-user/multi-host environments
# When enabled, object files are stored in a content-addressable cache
# that can be safely shared across users and build hosts
# Requires: objdir with SGID bit and group write permissions

# File locking configuration (for --shared-objects mode)
# Tune these values for your specific filesystem and network latency

# Cross-host lock timeout (seconds) - how long to wait before escalating warnings
# lock-cross-host-timeout = 600

# Lock wait warning interval (seconds) - how often to print "waiting for lock" messages
# lock-warn-interval = 60

# Lock creation grace period (seconds) - time to wait before considering a lock
# without PID file as stale. Prevents false positives when PID file is being written.
# Should be generous enough for slow NFS but short enough to detect real failures.
# lock-creation-grace-period = 2

# Lock strategy sleep intervals (seconds) - tune based on your network latency
# NOTE: Leaving sleep-interval-lockdir commented enables auto-detection (recommended):
#         Lustre  → 0.01s (fast parallel filesystem)
#         NFS     → 0.1s  (network latency)
#         GPFS    → 0.05s (middle ground)
#         Unknown → 0.05s (conservative fallback)
#       To override auto-detection, uncomment and set a numeric value:
# sleep-interval-lockdir = 0.1           # Manual override (not recommended)
# sleep-interval-cifs = 0.2              # For CIFS lock polling
# sleep-interval-flock-fallback = 0.1    # When flock command unavailable
# NOTE: Local filesystems (ext4/xfs/btrfs) use flock (blocking), not polling
