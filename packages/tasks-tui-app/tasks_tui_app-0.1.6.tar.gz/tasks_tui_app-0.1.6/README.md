# Tasks TUI

A simple, fast, and intuitive Terminal User Interface (TUI) for Google Tasks.

## Disclaimer
This application only runs natively on MacOs and Linus boxes due to its dependencies on Python's Curses. I am working to migrate this application over to Uni-Curses to support cross-platform. 
## Features

*   View your Google Tasks directly in the terminal
*   Add new tasks and lists.
*   Mark tasks as complete.
*   Rename tasks and lists.
*   Switch between your task lists.
*   Add due dates, notes, or subtasks
*   Vim-style keybindings for navigation.

When you run the application for the first time, it will open a web browser and ask you to authorize the application to access your Google Tasks. After you authorize the application, it will create a `token.json` file in the `~/.gtask` directory. This file contains your access and refresh tokens, so you won't have to authorize the application every time you run it.
