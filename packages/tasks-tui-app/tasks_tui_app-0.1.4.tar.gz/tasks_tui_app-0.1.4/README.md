When you run the application for the first time, it will open a web browser and ask you to authorize the application to access your Google Tasks. After you authorize the application, it will create a `token.json` file in the `tasks-tui` directory. This file contains your access and refresh tokens, so you won't have to authorize the application every time you run it.
