    Parameters
    ----------
    ms : str

    data : MetaflowData
        Container of all data artifacts produced by this task. Note that this
        call downloads all data locally, so it can be slower than accessing
        artifacts individually. See `MetaflowData` for more information.
    artifacts : MetaflowArtifacts
        Container of `DataArtifact` objects produced by this task.
    successful : bool
        True if the task completed successfully.
    finished : bool
        True if the task completed.
    exception : object
        Exception raised by this task if there was one.
    finished_at : datetime
        Time this task finished.
    runtime_name : str
        Runtime this task was executed on.

        Standard output for the task execution.
    stderr : str
        Standard error output for the task execution.
    code : MetaflowCode
        Code package for this task (if present). See `MetaflowCode`.
