def S3(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The Metaflow S3 client.
    
    This object manages the connection to S3 and a temporary diretory that is used
    to download objects. Note that in most cases when the data fits in memory, no local
    disk IO is needed as operations are cached by the operating system, which makes
    operations fast as long as there is enough memory available.
    
    The easiest way is to use this object as a context manager:
    ```
    with S3() as s3:
        data = [obj.blob for obj in s3.get_many(urls)]
    print(data)
    ```
    The context manager takes care of creating and deleting a temporary directory
    automatically. Without a context manager, you must call `.close()` to delete
    the directory explicitly:
    ```
    s3 = S3()
    data = [obj.blob for obj in s3.get_many(urls)]
    s3.close()
    ```
    You can customize the location of the temporary directory with `tmproot`. It
    defaults to the current working directory.
    
    To make it easier to deal with object locations, the client can be initialized
    with an S3 path prefix. There are three ways to handle locations:
    
    1. Use a `metaflow.Run` object or `self`, e.g. `S3(run=self)` which
       initializes the prefix with the global `DATATOOLS_S3ROOT` path, combined
       with the current run ID. This mode makes it easy to version data based
       on the run ID consistently. You can use the `bucket` and `prefix` to
       override parts of `DATATOOLS_S3ROOT`.
    
    2. Specify an S3 prefix explicitly with `s3root`,
       e.g. `S3(s3root='s3://mybucket/some/path')`.
    
    3. Specify nothing, i.e. `S3()`, in which case all operations require
       a full S3 url prefixed with `s3://`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    tmproot : str, default: '.'
        Where to store the temporary directory.
    bucket : str, optional
        Override the bucket from `DATATOOLS_S3ROOT` when `run` is specified.
    prefix : str, optional
        Override the path from `DATATOOLS_S3ROOT` when `run` is specified.
    run : FlowSpec or Run, optional
        Derive path prefix from the current or a past run ID, e.g. S3(run=self).
    s3root : str, optional
        If `run` is not specified, use this as the S3 prefix.
