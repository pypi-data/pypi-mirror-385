    ----------
    task : Union[str, `Task`]
        A `Task` object or pathspec `{flow_name}/{run_id}/{step_name}/{task_id}` that

    type : str, optional, default None
        The type of card to retrieve if multiple cards are present.
    follow_resumed : bool, default True
        If the task has been resumed, then setting this flag will resolve the card for
        the origin task.

    -------

        A list-like object that holds `Card` objects.
