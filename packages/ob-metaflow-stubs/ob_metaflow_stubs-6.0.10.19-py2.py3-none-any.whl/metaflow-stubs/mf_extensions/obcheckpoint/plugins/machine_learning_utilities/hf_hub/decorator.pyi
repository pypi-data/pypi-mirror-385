    This object provides a thin, Metaflow-friendly layer over huggingface_hub's [snapshot_download](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/package_reference/file_download#huggingface_hub.snapshot_download):
    
    - Snapshot references (persist-and-reuse): Use `current.huggingface_hub.snapshot_download(repo_id=..., ...)` to ensure a repo is available in the Metaflow datastore. If absent, it is downloaded once and saved; the call returns a reference dict you can store and load later (for example via `@model`).
    
    - On-demand local access (context manager):  Use `current.huggingface_hub.load(repo_id=..., [path=...], ...)` as a context manager to obtain a local filesystem path for immediate use. If the repo exists in the datastore, it is loaded from there; otherwise it is fetched from the Hugging Face Hub and then cached in the datastore. When `path` is omitted, a temporary directory is created and cleaned up automatically when the context exits. When `path` is provided, files are placed there and are not cleaned up by the context manager.
    
    Repos are cached in the datastore using the huggingface_hub.snapshot_download's arguments. The cache
    key may include: `repo_id`, `repo_type`, `revision`, `ignore_patterns`,
    and `allow_patterns` (see `cache_scope` for how keys are scoped).

    Parameters
    ----------
    temp_dir_root : str, optional
        The root directory that will hold the temporary directory where objects will be downloaded.
    
    cache_scope : str, optional
        The scope of the cache. Can be `checkpoint` / `flow` / `global`.
            - `checkpoint` (default): All repos are stored like objects saved by `@checkpoint`.
                i.e., the cached path is derived from the namespace, flow, step, and Metaflow foreach iteration.
                Any repo downloaded under this scope will only be retrieved from the cache when the step runs under the same namespace in the same flow (at the same foreach index).
    
            - `flow`: All repos are cached under the flow, regardless of namespace.
                i.e., the cached path is derived solely from the flow name.
                When to use this mode: (1) Multiple users are executing the same flow and want shared access to the repos cached by the decorator. (2) Multiple versions of a flow are deployed, all needing access to the same repos cached by the decorator.
    
            - `global`: All repos are cached under a globally static path.
                i.e., the base path of the cache is static and all repos are stored under it.
                When to use this mode:
                    - All repos from the Hugging Face Hub need to be shared by users across all flow executions.
            - Each caching scope comes with its own trade-offs:
                - `checkpoint`:
                    - Has explicit control over when caches are populated (controlled by the same flow that has the `@huggingface_hub` decorator) but ends up hitting the Hugging Face Hub more often if there are many users/namespaces/steps.
                    - Since objects are written on a `namespace/flow/step` basis, the blast radius of a bad checkpoint is limited to a particular flow in a namespace.
                - `flow`:
                    - Has less control over when caches are populated (can be written by any execution instance of a flow from any namespace) but results in more cache hits.
                    - The blast radius of a bad checkpoint is limited to all runs of a particular flow.
                    - It doesn't promote cache reuse across flows.
                - `global`:
                    - Has no control over when caches are populated (can be written by any flow execution) but has the highest cache hit rate.
                    - It promotes cache reuse across flows.
                    - The blast radius of a bad checkpoint spans every flow that could be using a particular repo.
    
    load: Union[List[str], List[Tuple[Dict, str]], List[Tuple[str, str]], List[Dict], None]
        The list of repos (models/datasets) to load.
    
        Loaded repos can be accessed via `current.huggingface_hub.loaded`. If load is set, then the following happens:
    
        - If repo (model/dataset) is not found in the datastore:
            - Downloads the repo from Hugging Face Hub to a temporary directory (or uses specified path) for local access
            - Stores it in Metaflow's datastore (s3/gcs/azure etc.) with a unique name based on repo_type/repo_id
                - All HF models loaded for a `@step` will be cached separately under flow/step/namespace.
    
        - If repo is found in the datastore:
            - Loads it directly from datastore to local path (can be temporary directory or specified path)

        This object provides a thin, Metaflow-friendly layer over
