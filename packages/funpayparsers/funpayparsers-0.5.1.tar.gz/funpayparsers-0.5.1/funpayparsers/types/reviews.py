    Represents a review.

    Reviews can be found on the seller’s page or on the order detail page.

    .. note::
        This dataclass does not include a field for review visibility for two reasons:

        1. Reviews appear in two contexts: on seller pages (public)
           and on private order detail pages (visible only to the involved parties).
           Visibility status is available only on private order pages.
           To maintain consistency, this field was omitted.

        2. The HTML structure of reviews is almost identical in both contexts,
           while the visibility flag is located outside the review’s main div.
           Therefore, visibility is handled in the dataclass representing
           the order page (``funpayparsers.types.pages.OrderPage``).
