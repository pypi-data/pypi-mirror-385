For clarity, any third-party content displayed on or through the Mistral AI Products to help you understand the Output, such as hyperlinks, snippets or thumbnails, for which you are only granted a right to view and read (the “Third-Party Content”) do not constitute Output. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you (i) retain all ownership rights in Input and (ii) own all Output.

Responsibility for Your Data. You are responsible for all Input and represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions required to provide Input to the Mistral AI Products. You are solely responsible for all use of the Outputs and evaluating the Output for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case.

We provide no guarantees that your Output will be unique. Any responses generated for other users by the Mistral AI Product are not considered your Output even if similar or identical to your Output.

Output Accuracy. Mistral AI Products are based on large language models (LLMs), a technology in continuous evolution. For this reason, the Output may occasionally be inaccurate.

It is recommended to use caution when using Mistral AI Products: always verify the reliability, accuracy, and completeness of the Output before relying on it for personal or professional purposes or publishing it.

3. Legal warranty
3.1 Legal warranty
Along with any commercial warranty provided under these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms, Consumers residing in France also benefit from the following legal warranty:

“Le consommateur a droit à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d’apparition d’un défaut de conformité durant la période de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique. Durant ce délai, le consommateur n’est tenu d’établir que l’existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d’apparition de celui-ci. La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique durant la durée d’enregistrement du compte du consommateur sur la plateforme. La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui. Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service  numérique, si :

Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;

La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;

La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;

La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service  numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;

La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.

Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu’il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n’est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable. Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n’a droit à l’annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d’un prix. Toute période d’indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu’à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme. Ces droits résultent de l’application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation. Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d’un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu’à 10 % du chiffre d’affaires moyen annuel (article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation). Le consommateur bénéficie également de la garantie légale des vices cachés en application des articles 1641 à 1649 du code civil, pendant une durée de deux ans à compter de la découverte du défaut. Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé, ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique."

4. Dispute resolution
If you are a consumer residing within the European Union, you have the right to start a mediation process in case of a dispute. 

To this end, you may contact our mediation Mistral AI Product, the CMAP, (a) by mail at Centre de Médiation et d’Arbitrage de Paris, 39 avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt, 75008 PARIS or (b) by email at cmap@cmap.fr.

You agree that the mediation process is not mandatory and that either party may withdraw from such mediation process at any time.

Any dispute which may arise under the Terms of Service or any Additional Terms shall be submitted to the competent court of the place of your residence or domicile.

NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, LICENSORS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR Mistral AI Product PROVIDERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE MISTRAL AI PRODUCT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 6 (LIABILITY) APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

6.2 Exclusions
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing limits either Party’s liability for: (i) Death or personal injury to limb or health caused by its negligence (including of its personnel); (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (iii) breach of Section 2.1 (License), Section 2.2 (Restrictions), or Section 9 (Confidentiality); (iv) matters for which liability may not be limited by applicable law.

7. Term, suspension and termination
7.1 Term
These Terms will commence on the earlier of (i) the date you first use the Mistral AI Products or (ii) the date you accept these Terms, and will continue until terminated.

7.2 Suspension
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Mistral AI Products if: (i) you breach these Terms, (ii) you fail to pay any fees when due, (iii) we need to do so in order to comply with applicable law, or (iv) your continued use of the Mistral AI Products could cause risk or harm to Mistral AI, our users, or anyone else. If you believe we have suspended or terminated your account in error, you can file an appeal with us by contacting us via the Help Center.

7.3 Termination for breach
Subject to the Partner Terms, either party may terminate this Agreement upon providing written notice to the other party if the other party commits a material breach of any term or condition of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach.

7.4 Other causes of termination
These Terms will automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of (i) our agreement with Partner that enables you to access the Mistral AI Products on the Infrastructure or (ii) your agreement with Partner that enables you to access the Mistral AI Product on the Infrastructure.

7.5 Effects of termination
Termination or expiration will not affect any rights or obligations, including the payment of amounts due, which have accrued under these Terms up to the date of termination or expiration. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, the provisions that are intended by their nature to survive termination will survive and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, including confidentiality obligations, limitations of liability, and disclaimers.

Upon any expiration or termination of these Terms, you will (a) cease to use the Mistral AI Products (including all Customized Mistral AI Products); and (b) destroy and certify the destruction within seven (7) days of the effective date of termination or expiration of these Terms: (i) all copies of the Mistral AI Products (including all Customized Mistral AI Products) you may have in your possession on Your Infrastructure and (ii) all copies of Mistral AI Confidential Information you may have in your possession on Your Infrastructure. “Customized Mistral AI Product” means a Mistral AI Product that has been customized under these Terms, including by means of combining the Mistral AI Product and Customer Owned Developments.

8. Personal Data
We may process your personal data included in your support requests. If you use the Mistral AI Products through a Partner, we may act as your Processor for the processing of personal data included in your support request and such processing shall be governed by our Data Processing Agreement, unless otherwise stated in the Partner Terms. 

9. Confidentiality
Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any and all information, in any medium, which is provided by one Party (“Discloser”) to the other Party (“Recipient”), that is either (a) marked as “confidential”, “proprietary” or similar words, or if disclosed orally, confirmed in writing as such by the Discloser following the disclosure; or (b) any information which Recipient should have reasonably considered to be confidential under the circumstances surrounding disclosure. 

Confidentiality obligation. Each Party acknowledges that during the course of performing its obligations hereunder it may receive or disclose Confidential Information. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the Confidential Information of the other Party may consist of trade secrets and proprietary information having significant commercial value, and that knowledge of all or any part of the Confidential Information would potentially yield a competitive advantage over others not having such knowledge. Accordingly, neither Party will (a) use the Confidential Information of the other Party except to exercise rights or perform obligations under this Agreement or (b) disclose the Confidential Information of the other Party to any third party except to Recipient’s directors, employees, or consultants to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, provided that all such recipients are obligated by a written agreement containing confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as described herein. Each Party will take such steps as may be reasonable in the circumstances, or as may be reasonably requested by the other party, to prevent any unauthorized disclosure, copying or use of the Confidential Information by such third parties. Each Party may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by judicial or governmental order or as necessary to comply with any applicable law or regulation governing regulated businesses or the issuance of securities to the public, provided that the party making the disclosure gives the other party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure and, in the case of a judicial or governmental order, complies with any applicable protective order or equivalent. Recipient agrees to exercise due care in protecting Discloser’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure, and at a minimum will use at least the degree of care a reasonable person would use with respect to Confidential Information of similar sensitivity. Recipient will promptly notify Discloser if Recipient becomes aware of any unauthorized disclosure or access to Discloser’s Confidential Information, or any security incident that may result in any unauthorized disclosure or access to Discloser’s Confidential Information and will cooperate with Discloser to remedy any such unauthorized disclosure or access and/or secure such Confidential Information.

Exclusions. Confidential Information herein will not include information that: (a) Recipient can demonstrate by its written records to have had in its possession prior to disclosure by Discloser; (b) was part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a result of  any action or inaction of Recipient; (c) was subsequently disclosed to Recipient from a  source other than Discloser who was not bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Discloser; or (d) Recipient can demonstrate by its written records to have been independently developed by Recipient without the use, directly or indirectly, of any Confidential  Information.

10. Audit
This Section 10 (Audit) only applies when you use the Mistral AI Products on Your Infrastructure and through a Reseller.

During the Term and for one (1) year thereafter, Mistral AI may, at its own expense and with thirty (30) business days' notice, conduct audits (up to one (1) audit per year) to ensure your compliance with Sections 2.1 (License) and 7.5 (Effects of Termination). You agree to provide all relevant documents and grant access to your premises and computer systems to enable Mistral AI to assess Customer’s compliance with this Agreement. Audits will be conducted by a third-party company selected by Mistral AI, free from any competitive interests with you and bound by professional confidentiality. You agree to cooperate in good faith with the appointed third-party auditor, providing necessary information and responding to audit-related inquiries. Audits must not unduly disrupt your business operations. If the audit reveals unauthorized use of the Mistral AI Products or Confidential Information, Mistral AI may: (a) instruct Reseller to charge you additional fees that you should have paid due to such unauthorized use; or (b) mandate the destruction of unauthorized versions or copies of the Mistral AI Products and/or Confidential Information. In the event of audit findings indicating Customer’s breach of the Agreement, the costs of the audit will be borne by Customer only. 

11.  General Provisions
Assignment. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms and any attempt to do so will be void. We may assign our rights or obligations under these Terms to any affiliate, subsidiary, or successor in interest of any business associated with our Mistral AI Product.

Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms (except for a failure to pay fees) if such delay or failure is due to unforeseen events beyond the reasonable control of such party.

Independent Contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created between the parties under these Terms. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

No Third-Party Rights. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

Waivers. No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Entire Agreement; severability. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between you and Mistral AI, these Terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Mistral AI Products. Any statements or comments made between you and any of our employees or representatives are expressly excluded from these Terms and will not apply to you or us, or to your access to or use of the Mistral AI products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.

Governing law and venue. (a) Unless you are located in the United States, the laws of France will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any applicable Additional Terms), or related Mistral AI Products, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in Paris, France, and you and Mistral AI consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. (b) If you are located in the United States, California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any applicable Additional Terms), or related Mistral AI Products, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Mistral AI consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
