## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **HDF5 Storage Format** 💾 – Efficient binary storage for radial profiles
  - 10-100x smaller files than JSON (with gzip compression)
  - Fast read/write for large datasets with 10,000+ radial points
  - Standard scientific format (Python, MATLAB, Julia, R compatible)
  - Automatic fallback to JSON if h5py not installed
  - Install with: `pip install tovextravaganza[hdf5]`
  
- **Maximum Mass Profile** 🎯 – New `--max-mass` flag for radial profiles
  - Automatically finds M_max with precision < 0.01 M☉
  - Fast adaptive search (50 coarse + 200 fine points)
  - Only computes full radial profile once at M_max
  - Works in both single-file and batch modes
  - Example: `tovx-radial --batch inputCode/Batch/ --max-mass`

- **Timeout Protection** ⏱️ – Prevent hanging on problematic configurations
  - Default: 10 seconds per star (configurable with `--timeout`)
  - Gracefully skips stuck calculations and continues
  - Works in TOV solver, radial profiles, and batch modes
  - Example: `tovx --batch inputCode/ --timeout 20`

- **Plot Viewport Control** 📊 – New `--rmax-plot` parameter
  - Zoom M-R plots to specific radius range (default: 20 km)
  - Only changes axis limits, doesn't crop data
  - Applies to all M-R diagrams in TOV and radial plots
  - Example: `tovx inputCode/hsdd2.csv --rmax-plot 15`

- **Phase-Coded Radial Plots** 🎨 – Beautiful visualization of internal structure
  - Color-coded by phase (Hadronic=blue, 2SC=orange, CFL=red)
  - Shows M(r), p(r), ε(r), n(r) from center to surface
  - High-resolution PNG output (200 DPI) for publications
  - Physical units: pressure & energy in MeV/fm³, number density in fm⁻³

- **Utility Modules**
  - `tovextravaganza.utils.timeout` – Cross-platform timeout decorator
  - `tovextravaganza.utils.read_radial_hdf5` – HDF5 data reader with examples

### Improved
- **Energy-Based String Interpolation** 🔬 – Critical fix for phase transitions
  - String columns (phase labels) now use energy density for nearest-neighbor search
  - Correctly handles first-order phase transitions where pressure plateaus
  - More robust than pressure-based approach for discontinuous transitions
  - Applies to ALL string columns, not just "phase"

- **Radial Profile Performance** ⚡ – Massive speed improvements
  - M-R curve calculation: Only computes M & R (not full profiles)
  - M_max search: Fast TOV solve (250 points in seconds, not minutes)
  - Full column interpolation: Only when generating actual profiles
  - ~100x faster for large EOS tables (20,000 points)

- **All EOS Column Tracking** 📋 – Complete data preservation
  - TOV solver: Tracks all columns at central pressure
  - Radial profiles: Interpolates all columns at each radial point
  - Supports mixed numeric and string columns
  - Dynamic CSV headers based on available columns

- **Windows Compatibility** 🪟 – Fixed Unicode encoding issues
  - Replaced M☉ symbols with "Msun" in terminal output
  - All print statements now work on Windows CMD/PowerShell
  - No more UnicodeEncodeError crashes

### Changed
- **Default timeout**: Now 10 seconds (was 60s in initial implementation)
- **Optional dependency**: h5py now in `[hdf5]` and `[all]` extras

## [1.4.2] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **Critical M-R Curve Bug** – Reverted problematic surface detection changes from v1.4.0
  - Surface detection restored to `p <= 0.0` (instead of `p <= eos.p_table[0]`)
  - TOV solver `dpdr` formula reverted to stable version
  - Integration starting point restored to `r=0.0`
  - DD2 EOS now correctly gives maximum mass ~2.42 M☉ (was broken at ~2.10 M☉)
  - All M-R curves now match reference implementations

### Improved
- **Interactive Batch Converter** – Batch mode now prompts for missing parameters
  - Automatically prompts for pressure column if not provided
  - Automatically prompts for energy column if not provided
  - Automatically prompts for unit system if not provided
  - Auto-creates `inputCode/Batch/` subfolder when processing batch directories
  - Works in both interactive and non-interactive modes
  
- **Tidal Deformability Accuracy** – Improved but still under active development
  - Lambda values within ~6% of reference for DD2 EOS
  - Further improvements planned for future releases

### Added
- Batch EOS test files for validation (RGgen v0.70, v0.80, v0.85)
- Comparison scripts for validating against reference implementations

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Central Column Values in TOV Output** 🎯 – Track ALL EOS columns at central pressure!
  - Automatically includes central values for all additional EOS columns (mu, n, temperature, phase, etc.)
  - Supports both numeric (interpolated) and string columns (nearest value)
  - Dynamic CSV headers: `central_<column_name>` for each additional column
  - Example: EOS with muB and phase_index → output includes `central_muB` and `central_phase_index`
  
- **Batch Processing for Unit Converter** 🚀 – Convert multiple EOS files in parallel!
  - `tovx-converter --batch inputRaw/` processes all files in parallel
  - Preserves ALL additional columns (strings, floats, whatever!)
  - Configurable unit systems and column mappings
  - Example: 3 files (1943 lines) converted in 0.60 seconds

### Improved
- Enhanced EOS reader with better commented header detection
- Automatic header normalization (pressure/epsilon → p/e)
- Support for mixed-type columns (numeric + string)
- Column name cleanup (removes "(code_units)" suffixes)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-19

### Added

  - `tovx-radial --batch inputCode/` processes all files in parallel
  - Organized output structure: each EOS gets its own subfolder
  - Same performance benefits and error handling as TOV batch mode
  - Example: 3 files with profiles processed in 38s with 2 workers

### Improved
- Better error handling in TOV batch processing
- Check for empty results before writing output

  - Comprehensive summary with success/failure statistics for each file
  - Significant performance improvements: ~45% faster with 2 workers, scales with more cores
  - Graceful error handling: individual file failures don't stop the batch
- Updated CLI help with batch processing examples
- Documentation in README with usage examples and performance benefits

### Performance
- Parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing module
- Automatic CPU core detection and utilization
- Example: 3 files processed in 4.7s (parallel) vs 6.8s (sequential)
