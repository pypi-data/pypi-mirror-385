# Changelog

All notable changes to TOV Extravaganza.

---

## [1.4.2] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **Critical M-R Curve Bug** â€“ Reverted problematic surface detection changes from v1.4.0
  - Surface detection restored to `p <= 0.0` (instead of `p <= eos.p_table[0]`)
  - TOV solver `dpdr` formula reverted to stable version
  - Integration starting point restored to `r=0.0`
  - DD2 EOS now correctly gives maximum mass ~2.42 Mâ˜‰ (was broken at ~2.10 Mâ˜‰)
  - All M-R curves now match reference implementations

### Improved
- **Interactive Batch Converter** â€“ Batch mode now prompts for missing parameters
  - Automatically prompts for pressure column if not provided
  - Automatically prompts for energy column if not provided
  - Automatically prompts for unit system if not provided
  - Auto-creates `inputCode/Batch/` subfolder when processing batch directories
  - Works in both interactive and non-interactive modes
  
- **Tidal Deformability Accuracy** â€“ Improved but still under active development
  - Lambda values within ~6% of reference for DD2 EOS
  - Further improvements planned for future releases

### Added
- Batch EOS test files for validation (RGgen v0.70, v0.80, v0.85)
- Comparison scripts for validating against reference implementations

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Central Column Values in TOV Output** ðŸŽ¯ â€“ Track ALL EOS columns at central pressure!
  - Automatically includes central values for all additional EOS columns (mu, n, temperature, phase, etc.)
  - Supports both numeric (interpolated) and string columns (nearest value)
  - Dynamic CSV headers: `central_<column_name>` for each additional column
  - Example: EOS with muB and phase_index â†’ output includes `central_muB` and `central_phase_index`
  
- **Batch Processing for Unit Converter** ðŸš€ â€“ Convert multiple EOS files in parallel!
  - `tovx-converter --batch inputRaw/` processes all files in parallel
  - Preserves ALL additional columns (strings, floats, whatever!)
  - Configurable unit systems and column mappings
  - Example: 3 files (1943 lines) converted in 0.60 seconds

### Improved
- Enhanced EOS reader with better commented header detection
- Automatic header normalization (pressure/epsilon â†’ p/e)
- Support for mixed-type columns (numeric + string)
- Column name cleanup (removes "(code_units)" suffixes)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Batch Processing for Radial Profiles** ðŸš€ â€“ Parallel processing now available for radial profiles too!
  - `tovx-radial --batch inputCode/` processes all files in parallel
  - Organized output structure: each EOS gets its own subfolder
  - Same performance benefits and error handling as TOV batch mode
  - Example: 3 files with profiles processed in 38s with 2 workers

### Improved
- Better error handling in TOV batch processing
- Check for empty results before writing output
- Race condition prevention with `exist_ok=True` for folder creation

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Batch Processing Mode** ðŸš€ â€“ Process multiple EOS files in parallel!
  - New `--batch` flag to process all CSV files in a directory
  - Configurable parallel workers with `--workers` flag (defaults to CPU count)
  - Comprehensive summary with success/failure statistics for each file
  - Significant performance improvements: ~45% faster with 2 workers, scales with more cores
  - Graceful error handling: individual file failures don't stop the batch
- Updated CLI help with batch processing examples
- Documentation in README with usage examples and performance benefits

### Performance
- Parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing module
- Automatic CPU core detection and utilization
- Example: 3 files processed in 4.7s (parallel) vs 6.8s (sequential)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-18

### Changed
- **Package reorganization**: Restructured into `core/`, `cli/`, `utils/` subdirectories
  - `core/` - Reusable business logic classes (EOS, TOVSolver, TidalCalculator, etc.)
  - `cli/` - Command-line interface tools (tov, radial, converter)
  - `utils/` - Utility scripts (wizard, demo, help_command)
- Cleaner, more professional package structure following Python best practices

### Improved
- Search accuracy now guarantees 0.01 Mâ˜‰ error (was 0.05 Mâ˜‰)
- Radius search accuracy 0.01 km (was 0.1 km)
- Better M > M_max error handling (returns None instead of silently using wrong value)

### Added
- Dashed lines for unstable branch in radial profile M-R diagrams
- M_max display in radial profile plot titles
- DEVELOPMENT.md guide for contributors
- Consolidated documentation (4 .md files instead of 8)

---

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- Version number display in `tovextravaganza` help command
- Accuracy guarantee for radial profile search (< 0.05 Mâ˜‰ for mass, < 0.1 km for radius)
- Dashed line for unstable branch in radial profile M-R plots
- DEVELOPMENT.md guide for contributors

### Fixed
- Updated all help messages to show correct `tovx` and `python -m` syntax
- Proper error handling when user requests M > M_max
- Wizard now uses correct module paths

### Optimized
- Radial profile search ~2.5x faster (2-step algorithm, stable branch only)
