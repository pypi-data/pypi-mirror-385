# Changelog

All notable changes to TOV Extravaganza.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed - Critical Accuracy Improvements! ðŸŽ¯
- **Tidal Deformability Calculation** â€“ Fixed bug causing 11% error in Lambda
  - Bug: `np.clip(f, 1.0, 100.0)` was capping de/dp at 100 near surface
  - Fix: Use only lower bound `max(1.0, f)` - near surface de/dp can be 104-140
  - Result: Lambda accuracy improved from 11-13% error to <2% error
  - Verified against independent C++ TOV solver

- **Surface Detection** â€“ Fixed EOS extrapolation beyond table bounds
  - Bug: Surface defined at p=0, causing extrapolation outside EOS table
  - Fix: Stop integration at p â‰¤ eos.p_table[0] (minimum tabulated pressure)
  - Result: Perfect M-R agreement (<0.1% error) with reference solver

### Improved
- **Tidal Integration** â€“ More rigorous 4-variable ODE system
  - Now integrates [M, p, H, beta] instead of [M, p, H]
  - beta integrated as separate first-order ODE (more accurate than numerical derivative)
  - Better numerical stability for tidal perturbation equations

### Added
- **Central Column Values in TOV Output** â€“ Track ALL EOS columns at central pressure!
  - Automatically includes central values for all additional EOS columns (mu, n, temperature, phase, etc.)
  - Supports both numeric (interpolated) and string columns (nearest value)
  - Dynamic CSV headers: `central_<column_name>` for each additional column
  
- **Batch Processing for Unit Converter** ðŸš€ â€“ Convert multiple EOS files in parallel!
  - `tovx-converter --batch inputRaw/` processes all files in parallel
  - Preserves ALL additional columns (strings, floats, whatever!)
  - Configurable unit systems and column mappings

### Documentation
- Enhanced EOS reader with better commented header detection
- Automatic header normalization (pressure/epsilon â†’ p/e)
- Support for mixed-type columns (numeric + string)
- Column name cleanup (removes "(code_units)" suffixes)

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Batch Processing for Radial Profiles** ðŸš€ â€“ Parallel processing now available for radial profiles too!
  - `tovx-radial --batch inputCode/` processes all files in parallel
  - Organized output structure: each EOS gets its own subfolder
  - Same performance benefits and error handling as TOV batch mode
  - Example: 3 files with profiles processed in 38s with 2 workers

### Improved
- Better error handling in TOV batch processing
- Check for empty results before writing output
- Race condition prevention with `exist_ok=True` for folder creation

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Batch Processing Mode** ðŸš€ â€“ Process multiple EOS files in parallel!
  - New `--batch` flag to process all CSV files in a directory
  - Configurable parallel workers with `--workers` flag (defaults to CPU count)
  - Comprehensive summary with success/failure statistics for each file
  - Significant performance improvements: ~45% faster with 2 workers, scales with more cores
  - Graceful error handling: individual file failures don't stop the batch
- Updated CLI help with batch processing examples
- Documentation in README with usage examples and performance benefits

### Performance
- Parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing module
- Automatic CPU core detection and utilization
- Example: 3 files processed in 4.7s (parallel) vs 6.8s (sequential)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-18

### Changed
- **Package reorganization**: Restructured into `core/`, `cli/`, `utils/` subdirectories
  - `core/` - Reusable business logic classes (EOS, TOVSolver, TidalCalculator, etc.)
  - `cli/` - Command-line interface tools (tov, radial, converter)
  - `utils/` - Utility scripts (wizard, demo, help_command)
- Cleaner, more professional package structure following Python best practices

### Improved
- Search accuracy now guarantees 0.01 Mâ˜‰ error (was 0.05 Mâ˜‰)
- Radius search accuracy 0.01 km (was 0.1 km)
- Better M > M_max error handling (returns None instead of silently using wrong value)

### Added
- Dashed lines for unstable branch in radial profile M-R diagrams
- M_max display in radial profile plot titles
- DEVELOPMENT.md guide for contributors
- Consolidated documentation (4 .md files instead of 8)

---

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- Version number display in `tovextravaganza` help command
- Accuracy guarantee for radial profile search (< 0.05 Mâ˜‰ for mass, < 0.1 km for radius)
- Dashed line for unstable branch in radial profile M-R plots
- DEVELOPMENT.md guide for contributors

### Fixed
- Updated all help messages to show correct `tovx` and `python -m` syntax
- Proper error handling when user requests M > M_max
- Wizard now uses correct module paths

### Optimized
- Radial profile search ~2.5x faster (2-step algorithm, stable branch only)

---

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed

- Documentation examples for source installation

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-18
