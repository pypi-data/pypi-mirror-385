Github Action
=============

SQRBOT-JR will add a github action to the test report repo when it is created.
This is a manual action and will pull the contents of the LVV from Jira regenerate
the document and push it to lsst.io.
It will check the update into the branch you call the action on.

If you have permissions on the github repo when you click on the action ``docgen from Jira``
you should see a ``Run workflow`` button appear.

If the button does not appear you need to be add to the organization to which the repo belongs.
You may find `owners` of the org, who can do this, by selecting `role` `owner` in the pull down on
the right of the org people page e.g. :

-   `DM owners <https://github.com/orgs/lsst-dm/people?query=role%3Aowner>`__
-   `SITCOM owners <https://github.com/orgs/lsst-sitcom/people?query=role%3Aowner>`__


To look at an example see `SCTR-14 action <https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/SCTR-14/actions/workflows/docgen_from_Jira.yaml>`__.

Migration to docsteady >= 3
---------------------------
If you action is still using conda it will need to be modified.
The 'ZEPHYR_TOKEN' secret must be added to the envirnment along with JIRA_USER and JIRA_PASSWORD.
The TOKEN has been add at the org secrets level already for DM, TS and SITCOM.

The conda line can be replaced with 'pip install docsteady>=3.0'.
Version 1.2. is an old artifact release in 2021 - for Jira cloud it must be a newer version
This could also be done at the install pyon step pf the action.
Python version >= 3.11 is required so check that in the set up also (some old actions are 3.7).

The docsteady call  and arguments remains the same as before.

To look at an example see `SCTR-14 action <https://github.com/lsst-sitcom/SCTR-14/actions/workflows/docgen_from_Jira.yaml>`__.
