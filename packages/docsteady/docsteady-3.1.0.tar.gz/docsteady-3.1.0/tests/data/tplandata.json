  "name": "LDM-503-EFDb: Replication of Summit EFD to USDF",
  "objective": "The purpose of this test plan is to describe all the necessary requirements and infrastructure for successfully testing the replication and archive of the Engineering Facility Database (EFD) as implemented with Kafka, InfluxDB and Chronograf from the summit to the USDF. This plan will describe the prerequisites for beginning a test campaign, step by step instructions for each test case and a description of the expected results and test artifacts.<br><br>NB: The use of the term reliability in this document is intended to indicate the number of messages produced relative to the number of messages recorded in the EFD. The system shall be considered reliable if at least 99.9% of produced messages are recorded.<br><br>At a high level, this test plan is intended to show that a nominally operating EFD at the summit is able to be replicated to the USDF and archived for future use either directly or via ingest into a secondary database management technology. We assume here that the archive technology will be parquet datasets stored on persistent/redundant disk at the USDF. There are no latency requirements in this test plan, but we will show that the replication and archiving are not falling behind relative to the summit instance in the aggregate. We choose a period of 6 days of continuous nominal operation in order to test the cases in this test plan.<br>Successful completion of the test campaign will show that:<br><ol><li>users are able to access the same information at the USDF EFD that was originally ingested in the summit version</li><li>the reliability of the replication is better than the minimum of 99%</li><li>archive products are able to be used as a primary source of information for historical examination of EFD topics</li></ol>",
