Installing docsteady
####################

Simple:

   pip install docsteady


Nicer:
Create a virtual environment based on the `docsteady` package some directly you like::

   python -m venv venv

To use docsteady, activate the environment as follows::

   pip install docsteady

This environment will provide all dependencies that are required to run docsteady.
Use it with:

   . venv/bin/activate
