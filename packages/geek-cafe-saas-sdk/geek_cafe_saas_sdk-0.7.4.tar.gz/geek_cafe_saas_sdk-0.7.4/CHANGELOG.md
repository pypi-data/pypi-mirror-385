- Versions: List by file (ordered)
- Shares: List by file, list by recipient

**S3 Integration**

- Metadata storage in S3 object tags

**Dependencies**
- `boto3` - AWS SDK

### 📝 SDK Consumption Model

This release emphasizes the SDK consumption model:

- **Services** are the primary interface - import and use directly in your code
- **Lambda handlers** are reference implementations to copy and customize
- **Models** handle DynamoDB serialization automatically
- **Tests** demonstrate usage patterns and best practices

Consuming projects should:
1. Install the SDK: `pip install geek-cafe-saas-sdk`
2. Use services in their application code
3. Optionally copy and customize Lambda handler templates
4. Deploy to their own AWS infrastructure

### 🔧 Infrastructure Requirements

**DynamoDB Table**
- Table with pk (hash), sk (range)
- GSI1: gsi1_pk (hash), gsi1_sk (range)
- GSI2: gsi2_pk (hash), gsi2_sk (range)
- Pay-per-request billing recommended

**S3 Bucket**
- Standard S3 bucket for file storage
- Optional: Enable versioning for s3_native strategy
- Recommended: Enable encryption at rest

**IAM Permissions**
- DynamoDB: GetItem, PutItem, UpdateItem, DeleteItem, Query
- S3: GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject
- S3: Optional presigned URL generation permissions

### 📊 Statistics

- **5 new services** with comprehensive business logic
- **4 data models** with DynamoDB integration
- **14 Lambda handler templates** ready for customization
- **99 tests** with 100% pass rate
- **12+ documented examples** in usage guide
- **Full API reference** for all service methods

### 🎯 Use Cases

This file system module is suitable for:
- Document management systems
- User file uploads and storage
- Team collaboration tools
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications
- File sharing platforms
- Version-controlled document repositories
- Media asset management

### 🔄 Optional Enhancements

The following features are not included but can be added by consuming projects:
- Storage quota management per tenant/user
- File type restrictions and validation
- Malware scanning integration
- Image processing (thumbnails, optimization)
- Multipart upload for large files (>100MB)
- Full-text search integration
- Activity/audit logging
- CDN integration (CloudFront)
- File locking for concurrent edits
- Webhooks and event notifications

### 📝 Notes

This release represents a complete, production-ready file system module. All core functionality is implemented and thoroughly tested. The module follows the SDK consumption model, providing reusable services that consuming projects can integrate into their applications.

### Changed

- Updated version from `0.1.11` to `0.2.0`
- Updated `__init__.py` with new version and description

### Migration Guide

Existing code continues to work unchanged. To adopt the new handlers:

**Before (156 lines with boilerplate)**:
```python
from geek_cafe_saas_sdk.middleware import handle_cors, handle_errors
# ... 50 lines of imports and helpers

_service = None
def get_service():
    global _service
    if _service is None:
        _service = VoteService()
    return _service

@handle_cors
@handle_errors
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    if not is_valid_api_key(event):
        return error_response(...)
    # ... 100 more lines
```

**After (113 lines, pure business logic)**:
```python
from geek_cafe_saas_sdk.lambda_handlers import ApiKeyLambdaHandler
from geek_cafe_saas_sdk.vote_service import VoteService

handler = ApiKeyLambdaHandler(service_class=VoteService)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return handler.execute(event, context, create_vote)

def create_vote(event, service, user_context):
    # Just business logic - everything else handled
    payload = event["parsed_body"]
    return service.create_vote(...)
```

See `docs/lambda_handlers.md` for complete migration guide.
