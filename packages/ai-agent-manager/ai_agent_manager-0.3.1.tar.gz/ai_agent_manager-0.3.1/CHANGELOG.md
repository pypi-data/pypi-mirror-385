## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-08

### üéâ Q CLI Agent Import Feature

Import existing Q CLI agents into AI Agent Manager with smart merge and resource handling.

### ‚ú® Added

**Q CLI Import:**
- Import agents from `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/` with `i` key in Agent Management
- Multi-select agents to import with Space key
- Smart merge for agents that exist in both locations
  - Combines resources and MCP servers (union)
  - Keeps local description/prompt when different
  - Shows merge summary
- Resource path resolution with user prompts
  - "Copy to library" or "Keep absolute path" per file
  - "Apply to All" option for bulk operations
  - Handles `file://` URIs from Q CLI
- MCP server extraction to registry
  - Auto-numbering for duplicate names (e.g., `fetch-2.json`)
  - Preserves full server configuration
- Import selection screen shows:
  - New agents (green)
  - Existing agents that will be merged (yellow)
  - Selection count
- Detailed error messages in notifications

### üêõ Fixed

- Handle `file://` URI prefix in Q CLI resource paths
- Expand `~` in file paths
- Skip non-existent resource files gracefully
- Use correct Pydantic models (ResourcePath, MCPServerConfig)
- Add required `source` field to ResourcePath objects
- Use correct filename format: `{name}_{tool_type}.json`
- Improved error logging and user feedback

### üìù Notes

This implements Phase 1 of the Q CLI sync feature. Import is one-way (Q CLI ‚Üí AI Agent Manager). Future versions may add bidirectional sync.
