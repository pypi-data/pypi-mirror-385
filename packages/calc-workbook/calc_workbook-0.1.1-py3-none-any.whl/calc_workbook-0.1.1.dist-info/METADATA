# calc-workbook

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/calc-workbook.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/calc-workbook/)
[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/calc-workbook.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/calc-workbook/)

**`calc-workbook`** is an easy-to-use Python library that loads Excel files, computes all formulas using the [`formulas`](https://pypi.org/project/formulas/) engine, and provides a clean, high-level API to access computed cell values from each sheet.  

## Overview

[`openpyxl`](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) is the most common Python package for reading and writing Excel files; however, it does **not** calculate cell formulas.  
The [`formulas`](https://pypi.org/project/formulas/) package adds support for evaluating a large set of Excel formulas, but it does **not** provide a straightforward interface to retrieve the computed values per sheet.

**`calc-workbook`** bridges that gap by exposing a simple interface with two core classes:

* `CalcWorkbook` – loads and computes the workbook, providing access to individual sheets.
* `CalcSheet` – provides access to computed cell values and sheet metadata.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install calc-workbook
```

---

### Example File

|       |    **A** |    **B** |
| ----- | -------: | -------: |
| **1** |       10 |        5 |
| **2** |       20 |       15 |
| **3** | `=A1+A2` | `=B1*B2` |

---

### Example Code

```python
from calc_workbook import CalcWorkbook

# Load workbook and compute formulas
wb = CalcWorkbook.load("example.xlsx")

# List available sheets (in lowercase)
print(wb.get_sheet_names())

# Access a specific sheet in lowercase
sheet = wb.get_sheet("sheet1") 
# Access first sheet
sheet = wb.get_sheet() 

# Retrieve computed values
print("A1:", sheet.cell("A1"))        # 10
print("A1:", sheet.cell([1, 1]))      # 10
print("A2:", sheet.cell("A2"))        # 20
print("A3:", sheet.cell("A3"))        # 30

# Get sheet dimensions
print("Rows:", sheet.rows())          # 3
print("Cols:", sheet.cols())          # 2
```

## Limitations

* Sheet names are stored and accessed in **lowercase** internally.
  When calling `get_sheet()`, always use the lowercase name (e.g., `"sheet1"`).

| `get_sheet_names() -> list[str]`      | Returns the list of all sheet names in the workbook.                                                         |
| `get_sheet(name: str) -> CalcSheet`   | Returns a `CalcSheet` object for the given sheet name.                                                       |
