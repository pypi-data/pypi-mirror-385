# pip-licenses Library

Retrieve the software license list of Python packages installed with *pip*.

If you are looking for a CLI based upon this library which is compatible with *pip-licenses*,
you might want to have a look at [pip-licenses-cli](https://github.com/stefan6419846/pip-licenses-cli).

## About

This package is a fork of the great [pip-licenses](https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses) tool, which provides a CLI with similar functionality.
For now, *pip-licenses* itself mostly focuses on the CLI part; while library-based access is possible, some interesting methods for further reuse
are nested and therefore hidden inside the corresponding API.

While there have been some attempts to provide similar features in the upstream repository, they are not available inside the official package at
the moment, while I needed a short-term solution. Examples:

* In May 2021, a package structure has been introduced by [#88](https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses/pull/88). In August 2023, this is still only available on a `dev-4.0.0` branch, while 
  version 4.0.0 has been released in November 2022.
* In October 2020, the PR [#78](https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses/pull/78) for handling multiple license files has been closed to maybe
  include it in the future, which has not yet happened.

As parsing the license data of packages as provided by the maintainers is at least some first hint regarding the license status, I decided to
create this fork with the required modifications and enhancements to suit my current needs.

## Differences to pip-licenses

Changes compared to the original version:

  * Use `dataclasses.dataclass` instead of a dictionary for each package information result.
  * Remove all output/rendering functionality.
  * Move all methods to the top level.
  * Always return all copyright and notice file matches.
  * Always return the system packages as well.
  * Add support for newer standards like PEP 639.
  * Include the license names and distribution object inside the results.
  * Add an option to skip retrieving license and notice files for faster version-only checks.
  * Add an option to normalize returned package names.
  * Enable support for Python < 3.8 by using the `importlib_metadata` backport.
    * This has been changed in the meantime. Please use `piplicenses-lib<=0.4.1` if you need to support Python < 3.9. 
  * Do not use abbreviations for naming purposes.
  * Rewrite tests to use plain *unittest* functionality.

## Installation

You can install this package from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install pip-licenses-lib
```

Alternatively, you can use the package from source directly after installing the required dependencies.

## Usage

The main entry point is `piplicenses_lib.get_packages()`, which will yield a list of package data objects.

## License

This package is subject to the terms of the MIT license.
