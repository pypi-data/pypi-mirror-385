## Routing Strategies Compared

### 1. Round-Robin (Baseline)
Simple sequential distribution across all nodes, no intelligence.

### 2. Random
Random node selection for each request.

### 3. SOLLOL Intelligent Routing
Context-aware routing with 7-factor scoring algorithm:
- Request analysis (task type, complexity)
- Resource matching (GPU requirements)
- Performance weighting (latency, success rate)
- Load balancing (CPU, queue depth)
