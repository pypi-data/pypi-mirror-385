# SOLLOL Production Readiness Assessment

**Version:** 0.3.6
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ⚠️ BETA - Production-capable with gaps

---

## Executive Summary

SOLLOL v0.3.6 has **strong foundations** for production use but requires additional work in several critical areas before being considered fully production-ready for enterprise environments.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Core functionality is stable and tested
- ✅ Basic deployment infrastructure exists
- ✅ Monitoring and observability basics in place
- ⚠️ Security features exist but need hardening
- ⚠️ Operational tooling needs expansion
- ❌ Enterprise features missing (multi-tenancy, audit logs, etc.)

**Recommendation:**
- **Suitable for:** Internal deployments, startups, research environments
- **Not ready for:** Multi-tenant SaaS, regulated industries, mission-critical production
- **Timeline to full production:** 2-3 months of focused development

dask_workers: 4  # 1x CPU cores recommended

# Ollama hosts - your actual cluster
hosts:
  - "ollama-gpu-1.internal:11434"
  - "ollama-gpu-2.internal:11434"
  - "ollama-cpu-1.internal:11434"

# Gateway
gateway_port: 8000  # Internal port (TLS via reverse proxy)
gateway_host: "0.0.0.0"

# Routing
routing_strategy: "performance"  # Use intelligent routing

# Metrics
metrics_enabled: true
metrics_port: 9090

# Health checks
health_check_enabled: true
health_check_interval: 60  # Check every minute

# Timeouts - adjust based on model sizes

## Known Limitations

### Current Version (0.3.6)

1. **In-memory state** - Restarting SOLLOL loses routing history
2. **Single-instance** - No multi-instance coordination
3. **No audit logging** - Can't track who made what request
4. **Manual failover** - Coordinator failures require manual restart
5. **No TLS** - Must use reverse proxy for HTTPS
6. **Limited auth** - API keys exist but not enforced by default
7. **70B model sharding** - Not extensively tested in production

### Workarounds

- **In-memory state:** Accept performance history reset on restart
- **Single-instance:** Run behind load balancer, accept no state sync
- **No TLS:** Use nginx/Traefik reverse proxy
- **Limited auth:** Enable auth in config, manage keys manually
- **70B models:** Start with 13B models, test thoroughly before production

---

## Success Stories & Production Use

### SynapticLlamas Integration

SOLLOL has been tested in production as part of the [SynapticLlamas](https://github.com/BenevolentJoker-JohnL/SynapticLlamas) multi-agent framework:

- **Workload:** 3-10 concurrent agents
- **Duration:** Several months
- **Results:** 30-40% latency improvement, automatic failover working
- **Limitations encountered:**
  - 70B model sharding not extensively tested
  - Coordinator reuse issues (now fixed in v0.3.6)
  - Need for better monitoring

**Lessons learned:** See [SYNAPTICLLAMAS_LEARNINGS.md](SYNAPTICLLAMAS_LEARNINGS.md)
