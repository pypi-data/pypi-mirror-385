## DeepFabric Pipeline

DeepFabric is designed to work within a modular MLOps pipeline, allowing you to customize each stage of the dataset generation process. The main components are:

- **Topic Generation**: Create a structured topic tree or graph based on a high-level prompt.
- **Data Generation**: Generate training examples for each topic using LLMs.
- **Format Engine**: Convert raw outputs into your desired dataset format.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Topic Prompt] --> B[Topic Tree/Graph]
    B --> C[Data Generator]
    C --> D[Format Engine]
    D --> E[Export/Upload]
```

By decoupling these components, you can easily swap out models, prompts, and formats to suit your specific needs, along with version controlling your configurations for reproducibility.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install DeepFabric

```bash
pip install deepfabric
```

### 2. Generate Your First Dataset

```bash
# Set your API key (or use Ollama for local generation)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Generate a dataset with a single command
deepfabric generate \
  --mode tree \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-4o \
  --depth 3 \
  --degree 3 \
  --num-steps 27 \
  --batch-size 1 \
  --topic-prompt "This history Quantum physics" \
  --generation-system-prompt "You are an expert on academic history, with a specialism in the sciences" \
  --dataset-save-as dataset.jsonl
```

Deepfabric will automatically:
- Generate a hierarchical topic tree (3 levels deep, 3 branches per level)
- Create 27 diverse Q&A pairs across the generated topics
- Save your dataset to `dataset.jsonl`

> [!NOTE]  
> Want to generate faster? Increase batch size! For example, if you set `--batch-size 3` and `--num-steps 9` deepfabric will generate 3 entries at a time, while ensuring rate limits of OpenAI are monitored (we use backoff, jitter etc). 

### 3. Use Your Dataset

Your dataset is ready in the OpenAI standard instruct format (JSONL):

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you explain Albert Einstein's contribution to quantum theory?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Albert Einstein made significant contributions to quantum theory, particularly through his explanation of the photoelectric effect, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1921. He proposed that light could be thought of as discrete packets of energy called quanta or photons, which could explain how electrons are emitted from metals when exposed to light. This idea was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He later became famous for his skepticism about quantum mechanics probabilistic interpretation, leading to his quote \"God does not play dice with the universe.\""
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Use local models.

Generate larger datasets with different models:

```bash
# With a depth of 4 and degree of 4^5 = 1,024
deepfabric generate \
  --provider ollama \
  --model qwen3:32b \
  --depth 4 \
  --degree 5 \
  --num-steps 100 \
  --batch-size 5 \
  --topic-prompt "Machine Learning Fundamentals"
  --generation-system-prompt "You are an expert on Machine Learning and its application in modern technologies" \
  --dataset-save-as dataset.jsonl
```

There are lots more [examples](./examples/README.md) to get you going.

### Topic Generation Modes

| Mode | Structure | Use Case | Max Topics |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Tree** | Hierarchical branching | Well-organized domains | depth^degree |
| **Graph** | DAG with cross-connections | Interconnected concepts | Flexible |
| **Linear** | Sequential topics | Simple lists | User-defined |
| **Custom** | User-provided structure | Specific requirements | Unlimited |

### Provider Support Matrix

| Provider | Models | Best For | Local/Cloud |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 | High quality, complex tasks | Cloud |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku | Nuanced reasoning | Cloud |
| **Google** | Gemini 2.0, 1.5 | Cost-effective at scale | Cloud |
| **Ollama** | Llama, Mistral, Qwen, etc. | Privacy, unlimited generation | Local |
| **Together** | Open models | Fast inference | Cloud |
| **Groq** | Llama, Mixtral | Ultra-fast generation | Cloud |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Small**: Test with `depth=2, degree=3` before scaling up
2. **Mix Models**: Use stronger models for topics, faster ones for generation
3. **Iterate**: Generate small batches and refine prompts based on results
4. **Validate**: Always review a sample before training
5. **Version Control**: Save configurations for reproducibility

### Analytics

We use privacy-respecting analytics to help us improve application performance and stability. We never send Personal identifiable information and we do not capture prompts, generated content, API keys, file names etc.

#### What We Collect
- **Anonymous User ID**: A stable, one-way hash based on your machine characteristics (hostname + MAC address). This helps us understand unique user counts without identifying you. Its impossible to reverse this hash to get your actual machine details and one-way only.
- **Usage Metrics**: Model names, numeric parameters (temperature, depth, degree, batch_size), timing and success/failure rates
- **Developer Flag**: If you set `DEEPFABRIC_DEVELOPER=True`, events are marked to help us filter developer testing from real usage

#### Privacy Guarantees
- No usernames, emails, IP addresses, or personal information
- User ID is cryptographically hashed and cannot be reversed and contains no Personal Identifiable Information
- No prompts, generated datasets, or sensitive data is collected
- All data is used solely for application improvement in regards to performance, stability, and feature usage

#### Control Your Participation
```bash
# Disable all analytics
export ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False

# Mark yourself as a developer (for filtering)
export DEEPFABRIC_DEVELOPER=True
```
