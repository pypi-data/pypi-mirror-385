Variables are viewed and edited in the GUI almost exactly the same as data, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gui.variables}.
An important exception is that, since there are only v1 variables arrays and no v2 arrays of v1 arrays, the variable creation window only has one pane, and separate v1 arrays created in different tabs of the window are completely independent.
Also, the user can clone an existing v1 array with the drop down menu below the "Duplicate" button.
