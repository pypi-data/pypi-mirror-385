# Welcome to MQT Bench's documentation!

MQT Bench is a tool for benchmarking quantum software tools.
It is part of the _{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the MQT Bench library, including {doc}`installation instructions <installation>`, a {doc}`quickstart guide <quickstart>`, and detailed {doc}`API documentation <api/mqt/bench/index>`.
The source code of MQT Bench is publicly available on GitHub at [munich-quantum-toolkit/bench](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/bench), while pre-built binaries are available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.bench/) for all major operating systems and all modern Python versions.
MQT Bench is fully compatible with Qiskit 1.2 and above.

If you are interested in the theory behind MQT Bench, have a look at the publication {cite:p}`quetschlich2023mqtbench`.
Furthermore, MQT Bench is also available as a [PennyLane dataset](https://pennylane.ai/datasets/single-dataset/mqt-bench).

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project.
If you want to contribute, you can find more information in the {doc}`contribution guide <contributing>`.
If you are having trouble with the installation or the usage of MQT Bench, please let us know on our {doc}`support page <support>`.
