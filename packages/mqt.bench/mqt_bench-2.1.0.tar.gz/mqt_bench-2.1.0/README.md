# MQT Bench - Benchmarking Software and Design Automation Tools for Quantum Computing

MQT Bench is a quantum circuit benchmark suite with cross-level support, i.e., providing the same benchmark algorithms for different abstraction levels throughout the quantum computing software stack.
MQT Bench is hosted at [https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/mqtbench/](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/mqtbench/).
It is part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Quantum Benchmark Suite:** Provides a wide range of quantum circuit benchmarks, including algorithms such as GHZ, QAOA, QFT, Grover, Shor, and many more. [List of benchmarks](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/mqtbench/benchmark_description)
- **Cross-Level Benchmark Generation:** Supports four abstraction levels—algorithmic, target-independent, target-dependent native gates, and target-dependent mapped—enabling benchmarking across the entire quantum software stack. [Abstraction levels](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/bench/en/latest/abstraction_levels.html)
- **Flexible Target and Gateset Support:** Generate circuits for various hardware targets and native gatesets, including IBM, IonQ, Quantinuum, Rigetti, and more. [Supported devices and gatesets](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/bench/en/latest/parameter.html)
- **Python API, CLI, and Web Interface:** Use MQT Bench programmatically via Python, from the command line, or through an interactive web interface—whichever fits your workflow. [Usage guide](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/bench/en/latest/usage.html)
- **Parameterized and Mirror Circuits:** Easily generate parameterized circuits (with random or symbolic parameters) and mirror circuits for robust benchmarking and error detection. [Quickstart](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/bench/en/latest/quickstart.html)
- **Export to Standard Formats:** Save generated circuits in OpenQASM 2, OpenQASM 3, and QPY formats for compatibility with other quantum tools. [Output formats](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/bench/en/latest/quickstart.html#output-formats)
- **Extensible and Open Source:** Actively maintained, fully open-source, and designed for easy integration and extension within the quantum computing community.

## Getting Started

`mqt.bench` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.bench/).

```console
(.venv) $ pip install mqt.bench
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from mqt.bench import BenchmarkLevel, get_benchmark

# Get a benchmark circuit on algorithmic level representing the GHZ state with 5 qubits
qc_algorithmic_level = get_benchmark(
    benchmark="ghz", level=BenchmarkLevel.ALG, circuit_size=5
)

# Draw the circuit
print(qc_algorithmic_level.draw())
```

> [!NOTE]
> MQT Bench is also available as a [PennyLane dataset](https://pennylane.ai/datasets/single-dataset/mqt-bench).

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/bench).**

## System Requirements

MQT Bench can be installed on all major operating systems with all [officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
