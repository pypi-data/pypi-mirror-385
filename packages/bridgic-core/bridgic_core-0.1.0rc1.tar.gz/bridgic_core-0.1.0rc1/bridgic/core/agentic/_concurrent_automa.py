class ConcurrentAutoma(GraphAutoma):

    This class is to provide concurrent execution of multiple workers.

    In accordance with the defined "Concurrency Model of Worker", each worker within 
    a ConcurrentAutoma can be configured to operate in one of two concurrency modes:

    1. **Async Mode**: Workers execute concurrently in an asynchronous fashion, driven 
    by the event loop of the main thread. This execution mode corresponds to the `arun()` 
    method of the Worker.
    2. **Parallel Mode**: Workers execute synchronously, each running in a dedicated 
    thread within a thread pool managed by the ConcurrentAutoma. This execution mode 
    corresponds to the `run()` method of the Worker.

    Upon completion of all worker tasks, the concurrent automa instance aggregates 
    the result outputs from each worker into a single list, which is then returned 
    to the caller.
