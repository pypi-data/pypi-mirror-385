# edupsyadmin

edupsyadmin provides tools to help school psychologists with their
documentation

## Basic Setup

You can install the CLI using pip or
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation).

Install with uv:

    $ uv tool install edupsyadmin

You may get a warning that the `bin` directory is not on your environment path.
If that is the case, copy the path from the warning and add it directory to
your **environment path** permanently or just for the current session.

Run the application:

    $ edupsyadmin --help

## Getting started

### keyring backend

edupsyadmin uses `keyring` to store the encryption credentials. `keyring` has
several backends.

- On Windows the default is the Windows Credential Manager (German:
  Anmeldeinformationsverwaltung).

- On macOS, the default is Keychain (German: Schl√ºsselbund)

Those default keyring backends unlock when you login to your machine. You may
want to install a backend that requires separate unlocking:
<https://keyring.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#third-party-backends>

### Modify the config file

First, you have to update the config file with your data using the config
editor TUI:

`edupsyadmin edit_config`

## The database

The information you enter, is stored in an SQLite database with the fields
described [in the documentation for
edupsyadmin](https://edupsyadmin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clients_model.html#)

## Examples

Get information about the path to the config file and the path to the database:

    $ edupsyadmin info

Add a client interactively:

    $ edupsyadmin new_client

Add a client to the database from a Webuntis csv export:

    $ edupsyadmin new_client --csv ./path/to/your/file.csv --name "short_name_of_client"

Change values for the database entry with `client_id=42` interactively:

    $ edupsyadmin set_client 42

Change values for the database entry with `client_id=42` from the commandline:

```
$ edupsyadmin set_client 42 \
  --key_value_pairs \
  "nta_font=1" \
  "nta_zeitv_vieltext=20" \
  "nos_rs=0" \
  "lrst_diagnosis=iLst"
```

See an overview of all clients in the database:

    $ edupsyadmin get_clients

Fill a PDF form for the database entry with `client_id=42`:

    $ edupsyadmin create_documentation 42 --form_paths ./path/to/your/file.pdf

Fill all files that belong to the form_set `lrst` (as defined in the
config.yml) with the data for `client_id=42`:

    $ edupsyadmin create_documentation 42 --form_set lrst

## Development

Create the development enviroment:

    $ uv v
    $ uv pip install -e .

Run the test suite:

    $ .venv/bin/python -m pytest -v -n auto --cov=src test/

Build documentation:

    $ .venv/bin/python -m sphinx -M html docs docs/_build
