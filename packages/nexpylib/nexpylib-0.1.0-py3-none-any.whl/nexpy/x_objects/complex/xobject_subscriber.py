"""
XSubscriber module for reactive X object integration.

This module provides the XSubscriber class, which combines the Publisher-
Subscriber pattern with the X object framework. It automatically updates its
X object values in response to publications from Publishers.

Example:
    Basic usage with a single publisher::

        from nexpy import Publisher, XSubscriber
        
        # Create a publisher
        data_source = Publisher()
        
        # Create an X object that reacts to publications
        def get_data(publisher):
            if publisher is None:
                return {"value": 0}  # Initial value
            # Fetch actual data when publisher publishes
            return fetch_current_data()
        
        x_obj = XSubscriber(
            publisher=data_source,
            on_publication_callback=get_data
        )
        
        # Now when data_source publishes, X object updates automatically
        data_source.publish()

    X object that automatically updates in response to Publisher publications.
    
    XSubscriber bridges the Publisher-Subscriber pattern with the X object
    framework, creating reactive data flows where X object values automatically update
    in response to external events. It combines the async/unidirectional nature of
    pub-sub with the validation and linking capabilities of X objects.
    
    Type Parameters:
        HK: The type of keys in the X object's hook mapping. Typically str for named
            hooks like "temperature", "humidity", etc.
        HV: The type of values stored in the X object's hooks. Can be any type - int,
            float, str, list, dict, custom objects, etc.
    
    Multiple Inheritance:
        - XComplexBase: Core X object functionality with hooks and validation
        - Subscriber: Async reaction to publisher notifications
        - Generic[HK, HV]: Type-safe key-value storage
    
    Architecture:
        1. **Subscription**: Subscribes to one or more Publishers
        2. **Publication**: When publisher publishes, `_react_to_publication` is called
        3. **Callback**: Callback function generates new values based on publication
        4. **Update**: X object updates its values via `submit_values()`
        5. **Propagation**: Linking, listeners, and subscribers are notified
    
    Use Cases:
        - React to external data sources (sensors, APIs, databases)
        - Aggregate data from multiple publishers
        - Create derived X objects from async events
        - Bridge async operations into the X object system
    
    Attributes:
        _on_publication_callback: Callback function that generates new values when
            publishers publish. Called with the publishing Publisher (or None initially).
    
    Example:
        Simple reactive X object::
        
            from nexpy import Publisher, XSubscriber
            
            # Create a data source
            temperature_sensor = Publisher()
            
            # Create X object that updates with sensor data
            def read_temperature(publisher):
                if publisher is None:
                    return {"celsius": 20.0}  # Initial value
                # Read actual temperature when published
                return {"celsius": get_sensor_reading()}
            
            temperature = XSubscriber(
                publisher=temperature_sensor,
                on_publication_callback=read_temperature
            )
            
            # Access current temperature
            print(temperature["celsius"])  # 20.0
            
            # Sensor publishes update
            temperature_sensor.publish()
            print(temperature["celsius"])  # Updated value
        
        Multiple publishers::
        
            # Create multiple data sources
            source1 = Publisher()
            source2 = Publisher()
            source3 = Publisher()
            
            # X object reacts to any of them
            def aggregate_data(publisher):
                if publisher is None:
                    return {"count": 0}
                # Can check which publisher triggered the update
                if publisher is source1:
                    return {"count": get_count_from_source1()}
                else:
                    return {"count": get_count_from_others()}
            
            data = XSubscriber(
                publisher={source1, source2, source3},
                on_publication_callback=aggregate_data
            )
            
            # Any publisher can trigger an update
            source1.publish()  # Updates data
            source2.publish()  # Also updates data
    
    Note:
        - The callback is called with `None` during initialization to get initial values
        - The callback is called with the publishing Publisher during updates
        - All updates happen asynchronously
        - The X object can be bound to other X objects like any other X object

        what values should be set based on which publisher triggered the notification.
        
        Args:
            publisher: Publisher(s) to subscribe to. Can be either:
                - Single Publisher: Subscribe to one data source
                - Set[Publisher]: Subscribe to multiple sources (reacts to any of them)
                The X object will automatically call `publisher.add_subscriber(self)`.
            on_publication_callback: Function that generates X object values when
                publications occur. Signature: (publisher: None|Publisher) -> Mapping[HK, HV]

                Example: lambda pub: {"temp": 20.0, "humidity": 50.0}
            logger: Optional logger for debugging. If provided, logs X object operations,
                value changes, validation errors, and hook connections. Passed to both
                the BaseXObject and Subscriber base classes. Default is None.
            nexus_manager: The NexusManager that coordinates value updates and validation.
                Uses the global DEFAULT_NEXUS_MANAGER by default, which is shared across
                the entire application. Custom managers can be used for isolated systems.
                Default is DEFAULT_NEXUS_MANAGER.
