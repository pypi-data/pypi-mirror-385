"""
Publisher module for the Publisher-Subscriber pattern implementation.

This module provides a lightweight, async-enabled Publisher class that manages
subscriptions and publishes updates to subscribers using weak references for
automatic memory management.

**Asynchronous Unidirectional Notifications**

The Publisher-Subscriber pattern in this module is designed for asynchronous,
unidirectional communication:

- **Asynchronous**: Publications trigger async subscriber reactions that run
  independently in the event loop. The `publish()` method returns immediately
  without blocking for subscriber reactions to complete.
  
- **Unidirectional**: Subscribers can only observe and react to publications.
  They cannot validate, reject, or influence the publisher's state.
  
- **Non-blocking**: Ideal for decoupled components performing I/O operations,
  network calls, database writes, or other async operations that should not
  block the main execution flow.

Example:
    Basic publisher-subscriber setup::

        from observables._utils.publisher import Publisher
        from observables._utils.subscriber import Subscriber
        
        # Create a custom subscriber
        class MySubscriber(Subscriber):
            async def _react_to_publication(self, publisher):
                # This runs asynchronously, doesn't block the publisher
                await perform_async_operation()
        
        publisher = Publisher(logger=logger)
        subscriber = MySubscriber()
        publisher.add_subscriber(subscriber)
        
        # Publish to all subscribers (returns immediately)
        publisher.publish()
        # Subscriber reactions happen in the background

    A Publisher that manages subscribers and publishes updates asynchronously.
    
    The Publisher uses weak references to track subscribers, enabling automatic
    cleanup when subscribers are garbage collected. It supports threshold-based
    cleanup (time and size) to maintain performance with many subscribers.
    
    **Asynchronous Non-Blocking Design**
    
    Publications are executed asynchronously, allowing subscribers to react
    independently without blocking the publisher or each other. When `publish()`
    is called, it:
    
    1. Returns immediately without waiting for subscriber reactions
    2. Creates asyncio tasks for each subscriber's `react_to_publication()` method
    3. Subscriber reactions execute independently in the event loop
    4. Errors in subscriber reactions are handled without affecting other subscribers
    
    This design is ideal for scenarios where reactions may involve I/O operations,
    network calls, or other potentially slow operations that should not block the
    publisher or other subscribers.
    
    Attributes:
        _logger (Optional[Logger]): Logger for error reporting.
        _references (set): Set of weak references to subscribers (inherited).
        _cleanup_interval (float): Time threshold for cleanup (inherited).
        _max_subscribers_before_cleanup (int): Size threshold for cleanup (inherited).

        Publish an update to all subscribed subscribers and/or callbacks.
        
        This method supports three publication modes: asynchronous (default), synchronous, 
        and direct.
        
        **Async Mode (Default) - Non-Blocking with Asyncio**
        
        In async mode (mode="async"), the method triggers the `react_to_publication` 
        method on each subscriber and **returns immediately** without waiting for 
        reactions to complete. All reactions execute asynchronously and independently 
        in the event loop - they do not block the publisher, each other, or the calling code.
        
        **Async Execution Flow:**
        
        1. Method is called (e.g., during Phase 6 of `submit_values()`)
        2. Asyncio tasks are created for each subscriber's reaction and callback
        3. Method returns immediately to caller
        4. Subscriber reactions execute in the background
        5. Each reaction completes independently
        
        This design ensures that slow subscriber reactions (network I/O, database
        operations, file writes, etc.) never block the main execution flow or
        affect the performance of value submissions.
        
        **Use Case:** Production code with I/O-bound operations, decoupled async components
        
        **Sync Mode - Blocking with Asyncio**
        
        In sync mode (mode="sync"), the method waits for each subscriber reaction
        to complete before returning. Reactions are executed sequentially using
        `loop.run_until_complete()`, blocking the calling code until all subscribers
        have finished reacting.
        
        **Sync Execution Flow:**
        
        1. Method is called
        2. For each subscriber, run their async reaction to completion
        3. Wait for reaction to finish before moving to next subscriber
        4. Method returns only after all reactions complete
        
        Sync mode is useful when you need guaranteed completion before proceeding,
        such as in testing or when reactions must complete before the next operation.
        
        **Use Case:** Testing, debugging, ensuring all async operations complete
        
        **Direct Mode - Synchronous without Asyncio**
        
        In direct mode (mode="direct"), both subscribers and callbacks are executed 
        directly as regular function calls without any asyncio machinery. This provides 
        the fastest, simplest execution path with minimal overhead - just like the 
        listener pattern.
        
        **Direct Execution Flow:**
        
        1. Method is called
        2. Each subscriber's `_react_to_publication_direct()` is called synchronously
        3. Each callback is called directly as a regular function
        4. No asyncio tasks, no event loop, no coroutines
        5. Method returns after all reactions complete
        
        **Important Requirements:**
        - Subscribers must implement `_react_to_publication()` as a regular (non-async) method
        - Only synchronous callbacks are supported (no async functions)
        - If async callback is encountered, it's skipped with error logged
        
        **Use Case:** Fast synchronous notifications, listener-like behavior, no async needed
        
        **Off Mode - Disabled Publishing**
        
        In off mode (mode="off"), the publish method returns immediately without 
        notifying any subscribers or executing any callbacks. This is useful for
        temporarily disabling notifications without removing subscribers.
        
        **Use Case:** Temporarily disable notifications, batch operations, performance optimization
        
        **None Mode - Use Preferred Mode**
        
        When mode=None (default when calling publish() without arguments), the 
        publisher uses its `preferred_publish_mode` setting (configured during initialization).
        This allows you to set a default behavior for all publish calls.
        
        **Use Case:** Consistent default behavior, easy mode switching
        
        **Cleanup**
        
        Dead subscriber references are automatically skipped in all modes (except "off").
        If cleanup thresholds are met, dead references are cleaned up before publishing.
        
        **Error Handling**
        
        - If a subscriber's reaction raises an exception and a logger is
          configured, the error is logged and other subscribers continue.
        - If no logger is configured, the error raises a RuntimeError.
        - Errors in one subscriber never affect other subscribers.
        
        **Parameters**
        
        mode : Literal["async", "sync", "direct", "off", None], default=None
            Publication mode:
            
            - None (default): Uses the `preferred_publish_mode` setting
            - "async": Non-blocking with asyncio, returns immediately, reactions run in background
            - "sync": Blocking with asyncio, waits for all reactions to complete before returning
            - "direct": Synchronous without asyncio, both subscribers and callbacks, no event loop overhead
            - "off": Disables publishing entirely, returns immediately without notifications
        
        **Important Notes**
        
        - When mode=None: uses the `preferred_publish_mode` property
        - In async mode: returns immediately, before subscriber reactions complete
        - In sync mode: blocks until all subscriber reactions complete, uses asyncio
        - In direct mode: blocks until all reactions complete, no asyncio, pure synchronous calls
        - In off mode: returns immediately without any notifications (useful for batch operations)
        - Subscriber reactions cannot influence the publisher's state (unidirectional)
        - Subscribers receive publications after values are already committed
        - Direct mode requires Subscribers to have synchronous `_react_to_publication()` methods
        - The preferred mode can be changed at runtime via the `preferred_publish_mode` property
        
        Example:
            Publishing with async reactions (default)::

            - Direct mode: callbacks execute immediately, no waiting needed, fastest option
            - Off mode: nothing executes, instant return
            - None mode: uses preferred_publish_mode, behavior depends on preference
