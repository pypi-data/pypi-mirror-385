          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
                                     Preamble
         
           The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
         freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
         License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
         software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
         General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
         Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
         using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
         the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
         your programs, too.
         
           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
         price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
         have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
         this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
         if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
         in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
         
           To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
         anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
         These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
         distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
         
           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
         gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
         you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
         source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
         rights.
         
           We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
         (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
         distribute and/or modify the software.
         
           Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
         that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
         software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
         want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
         that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
         authors' reputations.
         
           Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
         patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
         program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
         program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
         patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
         
           The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
         modification follow.
         
                             GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
         
           0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
         a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
         under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
         refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
         means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
         that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
         either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
         language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
         the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
         
         Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
         covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
         running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
         is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
         Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
         Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
         
           1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
         source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
         conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
         copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
         notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
         and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
         along with the Program.
         
         You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
         you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
         
           2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
         of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
         distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
         above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
         
             a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
         
             b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
             whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
             part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
             parties under the terms of this License.
         
             c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
             when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
             interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
             announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
             notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
             a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
             these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
             License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
             does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
             the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
         
         These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
         identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
         and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
         themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
         sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
         distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
         on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
         this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
         entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
         
         Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
         your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
         exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
         collective works based on the Program.
         
         In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
         with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
         a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
         the scope of this License.
         
           3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
         under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
         Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
         
             a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
             source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
             1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
         
             b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
             years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
             cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
             machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
             distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
             customarily used for software interchange; or,
         
             c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
             to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
             allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
             received the program in object code or executable form with such
             an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
         
         The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
         making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
         code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
         associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
         control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
         special exception, the source code distributed need not include
         anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
         form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
         operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
         itself accompanies the executable.
         
         If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
         access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
         access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
         distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
         compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
         
           4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
         except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
         otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
         void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
         However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
         this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
         parties remain in full compliance.
         
           5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
         signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
         distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
         prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
         modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
         Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
         all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
         the Program or works based on it.
         
           6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
         Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
         original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
         these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
         restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
         You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
         this License.
         
           7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
         infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
         conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
         otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
         excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
         distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
         License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
         may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
         license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
         all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
         the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
         refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
         
         If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
         any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
         apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
         circumstances.
         
         It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
         patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
         such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
         integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
         implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
         generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
         through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
         system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
         to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
         impose that choice.
         
         This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
         be a consequence of the rest of this License.
         
           8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
         certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
         original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
         may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
         those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
         countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
         the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
         
           9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
         of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
         be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
         address new problems or concerns.
         
         Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
         specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
         later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
         either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
         Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
         this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
         Foundation.
         
           10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
         programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
         to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
         Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
         make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
         of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
         of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
         
                                     NO WARRANTY
         
           11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
         FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
         OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
         PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
         OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
         MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
         TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
         PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
         REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
         
           12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
         WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
         REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
         INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
         OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
         TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
         YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
         PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
         POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
         
                              END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
                     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
         
           If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
         possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
         free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
         
           To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
         to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
         convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
         the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
         
             <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
             Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
         
             This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
             it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
             the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
             (at your option) any later version.
         
             This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
             but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
             MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
             GNU General Public License for more details.
         
             You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
             with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
             51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
         
         Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
         
         If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
         when it starts in an interactive mode:
         
             Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
             Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
             This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
             under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
         
         The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
         parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
         be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
         mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
         
         You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
         school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
         necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
         
           Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
           `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
         
           <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
           Ty Coon, President of Vice
         
         This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
         proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
         consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
         library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
         Public License instead of this License.

# reqman (3.X)
Reqman is a postman killer ;-)

**Reqman** is a [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) killer. It shares the same goal, but without GUI ... the GUI is simply your favorite text editor, because requests/tests are only simple yaml files. **Reqman** is a command line tool, available on any platforms.

[Video (1minute)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ToK-5VwxhP4?autoplay=1&loop=1&playlist=ToK-5VwxhP4&cc_load_policy=1)

All configurations is done via simple yaml files, editable with any text editors. Results are displayed in console and in an html output. It's scriptable, and can be used as a daemon/cron task to automate your tests.

**TODO** : need to rewrite this ^^ ;-)

## Getting started : installation

If you are on an *nix platform, you can start with pip :

    $ pip3 install reqman

it will install the _reqman_ script in your path (perhaps, you'll need to Add the path `~/.local/bin` to the _PATH_ environment variable.)

If you are on microsoft windows, just download [reqman.exe (v3)](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/master/dist/reqman.exe).
 [The old reqman.exe V2, is still there](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/ac7d96319bf53e08f5a01ff55c54ef820e839fa6/dist/reqman.exe), and add it in your path.
 [The old reqman.exe V1, is still there](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/reqman1.4.4.0/dist/reqman.exe), and add it in your path.


## Getting started : let's go

Imagine that you want to test the [json api from pypi.org](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPIJSON), to verify that [it finds me](https://pypi.org/pypi/reqman/json) ;-)
(if you are on windows, just replace `reqman` with `reqman.exe`)

You can start a new project in your folder, like that:

    $ reqman new https://pypi.org/pypi/reqman/json

It's the first start ; it will create a conf file _reqman.conf_ and a (basic) test file _0010_test.rml_. Theses files are [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), so ensure that your editor understand them !
(Following 'new' command will just create another fresh rml file if a _reqman.conf_ exists)

Now, you can run/test it :

    $ reqman .

It will scan your folder "." and run all test files (`*.rml` or `*.yml`) against the _reqman.conf_ ;-)

It will show you what's happened in your console. And generate a `reqman.html` with more details (open it to have an idea)!

If you edit the `reqman.conf`, you will see :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)
```

the **root** is a `special var` which will be prependded to all relative urls in your requests tests.
the **headers** (which is a `special var` too) is a set of `http headers` which will be added to all your requests.

Change it to, and save it :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)

switches:
    test:
        root: https://test.pypi.org
```

Now, you have created your first _switch_. And try to run your tests like this:

    $ reqman.py . -test

It will run your tests against the _root_ defined in _test_ section ; and the test is KO, because _reqman_ doesn't exist on test.pypi.org !
In fact; all declared things under _test_ will replace those at the top ! So you can declare multiple environments, with multiple switches !

But you can declare what you want, now edit _reqman.conf_ like this :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)

package: reqman

switches:
    test:
        root: https://test.pypi.org
```

You have declared a _var_ **package** ! let's edit the test file _0010_test.rml_ like this :

```yaml
- GET: /pypi/<<package>>/json
  tests:
    - status: 200
```

Now, your test will use the **package** var which was declared in _reqman.conf_ ! So, you can create a _switch_ to change the package thru the command line, simply edit your _reqman.conf_ like that :

```yaml
root: https://pypi.org
headers:
    User-Agent: reqman (https://github.com/manatlan/reqman)

package: reqman

switches:
    test:
        root: https://test.pypi.org

    colorama:
        package: colorama
```

Now, you can check that 'colorama' exists on pypi.org, like that :

    $ reqman . -colorama

And you can check that 'colorama' exists on test.pypi.org, like that :

    $ reqman . -colorama -test

As you can imagine, it's possible to make a lot of fun things easily. (see a more complex [reqman.conf](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/master/examples/reqman.conf))


Now, you can edit your rml file, and try the things available in this [tuto](https://github.com/manatlan/reqman/blob/reqman1.4.4.0/examples/tuto.yml).
Organize your tests as you want : you can make many requests in a rml file, you can make many files with many requests, you can make folders which contain many rml files. _Reqman_ will not scan sub-folders starting with "_" or ".".

_reqman_ will return an `exit code` which contains the number of KO tests : 0 if everything is OK, or -1 if there is a trouble (tests can't be runned) : so it's easily scriptable in your automated workflows !


# Ability to override reqman's features for your propers needs (reqman>=2.8.1)
Now, it's super easy to override reqman with your own features. Using 'reqman' as a lib/module for your python's code.
You can declare your own methods, to fulfill your specials needs (hide special mechanism, use external libs, ...):
(Thoses real python methods, just needs to respect the same signature as pyhon methods declared in confs.)

```python
import reqman

reqman.__usage__ = "USAGE: reqmanBis ..."   # override usage or not ;-)

@reqman.expose
def SpecialMethod(x,ENV):
    """
    Do what you want ...

    Args:
        'x'   : the input var (any) or None.
        'ENV' : the current env (dict)

    Returns:
        any
    """
    ...
    return "What you need"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(reqman.main())
```

Now, you can use `SpecialMethod` in your scripts, ex: `<<value|SpecialMethod>>` or `<<SpecialMethod>>`!

Use and abuse !
