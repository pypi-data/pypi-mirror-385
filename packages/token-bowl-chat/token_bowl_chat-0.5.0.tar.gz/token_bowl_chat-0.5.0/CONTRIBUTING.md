## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/token-bowl-chat.git
   cd token-bowl-chat
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/RobSpectre/token-bowl-chat.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Using uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is the fastest Python package installer and is recommended for development:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Using pip

Alternatively, you can use traditional pip:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

1. **Keep your main branch in sync** with upstream:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Use descriptive branch names:
   - `feature/` - New features
   - `fix/` - Bug fixes
   - `docs/` - Documentation changes
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
   - `test/` - Test additions or modifications

### Code Style

This project follows Python best practices:

- **Type hints**: All functions should have complete type annotations
- **Docstrings**: Use clear docstrings for all public APIs (Google style)
- **Line length**: Maximum 88 characters (enforced by ruff)
- **Imports**: Organized and sorted automatically by ruff

### Writing Code

1. **Keep changes focused**: Each pull request should address a single concern
2. **Write tests**: All new features should include tests
3. **Update documentation**: Update relevant documentation for your changes
4. **Add type hints**: Ensure all new code has proper type annotations

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run the full test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=token_bowl_chat --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_client.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_client.py::test_send_message_room
```

### Test Requirements

- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
- **All test types**: Include unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
- **Async tests**: Use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async client tests
- **Mocking**: Use `pytest-httpx` for mocking HTTP requests

### Writing Tests

Example test structure:

```python
import pytest
from pytest_httpx import HTTPXMock
from token_bowl_chat import TokenBowlClient

def test_your_feature(httpx_mock: HTTPXMock) -> None:
    """Test description explaining what is being tested."""
    # Arrange
    client = TokenBowlClient(api_key="test-key", base_url="http://test.example.com")
    httpx_mock.add_response(
        method="POST",
        url="http://test.example.com/endpoint",
        json={"result": "success"},
        status_code=200,
    )

    # Act
    result = client.your_method()

    # Assert
    assert result.some_field == "expected_value"
```

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses ruff for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check code quality
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

### Type Checking

Use mypy for static type checking:

```bash
mypy src
```

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, ensure:

1. âœ… All tests pass: `pytest`
2. âœ… No linting errors: `ruff check .`
3. âœ… Code is formatted: `ruff format .`
4. âœ… Type checking passes: `mypy src`

You can run all checks at once:

```bash
pytest && ruff check . && ruff format . && mypy src
```

## Submitting Changes

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add feature to handle message pagination

- Implement offset-based pagination in get_messages()
- Add pagination metadata to response models
- Include tests for pagination edge cases

Fixes #123
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what and why
   - Reference to related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Screenshots for UI changes (if applicable)

4. **Address review feedback** promptly and professionally

5. **Ensure CI passes**: All automated checks must pass before merge

### Pull Request Checklist
