# Syntax Error Fix - TUI Analysis Progress Screen

## Issue
The TUI failed to launch with error:
```
❌ Failed to launch TUI: expected 'except' or 'finally' block (analysis_progress_screen.py, line 416)
```

## Root Cause
Indentation error in `/src/gitflow_analytics/tui/screens/analysis_progress_screen.py` at line 416. The code inside the `try` block and `except` block had incorrect indentation after the parallel processing implementation was added.

## Fix Applied
Fixed indentation in two places:

1. **Lines 416-441**: Moved code inside the `try` block with proper indentation
2. **Lines 444-445**: Fixed indentation of code inside the `except` block

### Before:
```python
try:
    # code...
    )

log.write_line(f"   ✓ Analysis complete...")  # Wrong - outside try block

except Exception as e:
log.write_line(f"   ❌ Error...")  # Wrong - not indented
```

### After:
```python
try:
    # code...
    )

    log.write_line(f"   ✓ Analysis complete...")  # Correct - inside try block

except Exception as e:
    log.write_line(f"   ❌ Error...")  # Correct - properly indented
```

## Verification
The TUI now launches successfully:
```bash
gitflow-analytics tui -c config.yaml -w 4
```
