# GitFlow Analytics Progress Tracking Fixes

## Summary
Fixed critical progress tracking bugs that caused the system to show incorrect statistics during repository analysis, including showing "Processed: 0/96" even when at 99% completion.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Repository Processed Counter Not Incrementing
**Problem:** The processed counter remained at 0 even when repositories were being analyzed.
**Root Cause:** The counter was incremented in the `finally` block but UI updates happened before that.
**Fix:** Moved the counter increment to happen immediately in the `finally` block and added explicit stats updates.

### 2. Progress Percentage Calculation Errors
**Problem:** Progress showed incorrect percentages like 1500% or stuck at 99%.
**Root Cause:** Incorrect calculation logic and no capping at 100%.
**Fix:**
- Implemented proper percentage calculation: `(processed / total) * 100.0`
- Added capping at 100% to prevent overflow
- Fixed calculation to use actual processed count, not estimates

### 3. Disconnected Progress Tracking
**Problem:** TUI progress wasn't connected to actual data fetcher progress.
**Root Cause:** TUI used sequential processing instead of parallel, and progress adapters weren't properly connected.
**Fix:**
- Enhanced TUIProgressAdapter with processing stats tracking
- Added `start_repository()`, `finish_repository()`, and `update_stats()` methods
- Modified TUI to use parallel processing when multiple repositories exist

### 4. Missing Completion Signals
**Problem:** Repository completion wasn't properly signaled to the UI.
**Fix:** Added proper completion signals with success/failure status and error messages.

## Files Modified

### `/src/gitflow_analytics/core/data_fetcher.py`
- Updated `process_repositories_parallel()` to increment processed counter immediately
- Added stats updates before progress service calls
- Fixed stats parameter passing to be conditional based on progress service capabilities

### `/src/gitflow_analytics/tui/progress_adapter.py`
- Added processing stats tracking to TUIProgressAdapter
- Implemented repository tracking methods
- Enhanced progress display with statistics
- Fixed percentage calculation and capping

### `/src/gitflow_analytics/tui/screens/analysis_progress_screen.py`
- Modified to use parallel processing for multiple repositories
- Added fallback to sequential processing for single repository or on error
- Improved progress tracking integration

### `/src/gitflow_analytics/core/subprocess_git.py`
- Already had timeout protection (30 seconds for git operations)

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
1. Repository processed counter increments correctly
2. Progress percentages never exceed 100%
3. Statistics update before UI refresh
4. Parallel processing works with proper progress tracking

## How to Verify

Run the TUI with multiple repositories:
```bash
gitflow-analytics tui -c config.yaml --weeks 1
```

You should now see:
- Correct progress percentages (0-100%)
- Accurate processed counts (e.g., "Processed: 5/10")
- Real-time updates as repositories complete
- Proper success/failure statistics

## Timeout Protection

The system includes comprehensive timeout protection:
- 30 seconds for git fetch/pull operations
- 15 seconds for git iter_commits operations
- 5 minutes total timeout for entire analysis (configurable)

This prevents the system from hanging on authentication issues or network problems.
