github:
  token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
  repositories:
    - owner: "myorg"
      name: "myrepo"
      local_path: "./myrepo"
```

### Organization Discovery  
```yaml
# org-config.yaml
github:
  token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
  organization: "myorg"  # Discovers all repositories
  
analysis:
  weeks: 8
```

### ML-Enhanced Analysis
```yaml
# ml-config.yaml
github:
  token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
  organization: "myorg"

analysis:
  weeks: 12
  enable_ml_categorization: true
  
ml_categorization:
  model_name: "en_core_web_sm"
  confidence_threshold: 0.7
```

## üí° Example Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with Basic**: Use basic analysis to understand your repository
2. **Add Features**: Gradually enable ML categorization and advanced options  
3. **Scale Up**: Move to organization-wide analysis as needed
4. **Automate**: Integrate with CI/CD for regular insights

### Analysis Cadence
```yaml
# Weekly sprint reviews
analysis:
  weeks: 2
  
# Monthly team health  
analysis:
  weeks: 4
  
# Quarterly planning
analysis:
  weeks: 12
  
# Annual reviews
analysis:
  weeks: 52
```

## üîß Customization Examples

### Focus on Specific Areas
```yaml
analysis:
  # Only analyze Python and JavaScript
  include_file_patterns:
    - "*.py"
    - "*.js" 
    - "*.ts"
    
  # Exclude generated files
  exclude_file_patterns:
    - "*.min.js"
    - "package-lock.json"
    - "__pycache__/*"
```

### Custom Report Formats
```yaml
reports:
  formats: ["csv", "json", "markdown"]
  output_directory: "./reports"
  
  # Custom naming
  filename_template: "team_analysis_{date}"
  
  # Include additional data
  include_untracked_analysis: true
  include_detailed_metrics: true
```

## üìä Expected Outputs

Each example shows expected report structure and key insights you'll receive:

- **CSV Reports**: Structured data for analysis and integration
- **Markdown Reports**: Human-readable insights and recommendations
- **JSON Exports**: Complete data for custom tooling and dashboards

## üÜò Common Adaptations

### Adapting Examples for Your Environment

1. **Repository URLs**: Replace example repositories with your own
2. **Authentication**: Set up your GitHub token and credentials
3. **Time Periods**: Adjust `weeks` parameter for your analysis needs
4. **Output Locations**: Customize paths for your directory structure
5. **Team Structure**: Modify identity mappings for your developers

### Testing New Configurations

```bash
# Validate configuration without running analysis
gitflow-analytics -c your-config.yaml --validate-only

# Test with shorter time period first
gitflow-analytics -c your-config.yaml --weeks 2

# Clear cache if making major changes
gitflow-analytics -c your-config.yaml --clear-cache
```
