- Rationale: Zero-configuration, embedded database, excellent performance
- Trade-offs: Single-writer limitation vs. deployment simplicity

**spaCy for NLP**
- Decision: Use spaCy for natural language processing and ML
- Rationale: Production-ready, efficient, good accuracy for commit analysis
- Trade-offs: Model size vs. accuracy and processing speed

**YAML for Configuration**
- Decision: Use YAML with environment variable substitution
- Rationale: Human-readable, supports comments, widely adopted
- Trade-offs: Parsing complexity vs. user-friendliness

### Design Patterns

**Plugin Architecture**
- Integration adapters for different PM platforms
- Report format extensibility
- ML model swappability
- Custom analysis rules

**Command Pattern**  
- CLI command structure and argument parsing
- Batch processing and pipeline operations
- Undo/redo capabilities for interactive features

**Observer Pattern**
- Progress reporting and status updates
- Event-driven analysis pipeline
- Plugin notification system

**Factory Pattern**
- Report format generation
- Integration adapter creation
- ML model instantiation

## üìä Data Model Design

**Developer Entity**
```python
@dataclass
class Developer:
    canonical_id: str
    display_name: str
    email_addresses: List[str]
    confidence_score: float
    manual_override: bool
```

**Repository Entity**
```python  
@dataclass
class Repository:
    owner: str
    name: str
    local_path: Path
    primary_language: str
    project_key: Optional[str]
```

**Commit Entity**
```python
@dataclass  
class Commit:
    hash: str
    author: Developer
    timestamp: datetime
    message: str
    files_changed: List[str]
    category: CommitCategory
    confidence: float
```

### Relationships
- One-to-Many: Developer ‚Üí Commits
- Many-to-Many: Developer ‚Üî Repository (through commits)
- One-to-Many: Repository ‚Üí Commits
- Many-to-One: Commits ‚Üí Categories
