# GitFlow Analytics Documentation Structure

This document describes the organization and structure of GitFlow Analytics documentation, designed to serve different audiences with clear navigation paths.

## 📚 Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows a **progressive disclosure** model:
- **Users** find what they need to get started quickly
- **Developers** can dive deep into implementation details
- **Contributors** have clear guidance on project standards
- **Maintainers** have architectural context for decisions

## 📋 Documentation Standards

### File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `file-name.md`
- Be descriptive but concise: `ml-categorization.md` not `ml.md`
- Use consistent suffixes: `-guide.md`, `-reference.md`, `-overview.md`

### Content Structure
1. **Title and Brief Description** - What this document covers
2. **Prerequisites** - What users should know/have done first
3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** - Clear, numbered procedures
4. **Examples** - Real-world usage scenarios
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Next Steps** - Where to go next

### Cross-Referencing
- Use relative links within documentation: `[Configuration Guide](../guides/configuration.md)`
- Link to external resources with full URLs
- Include "See Also" sections for related topics
- Reference CLI commands with code blocks

### Code Examples
- Always provide complete, runnable examples
- Include expected output when helpful
- Use consistent formatting and style
- Test all examples before committing

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Main README.md
The main project README.md provides overview and quick start, then directs users to:
- `docs/getting-started/` for detailed setup
- `docs/examples/` for usage scenarios
- `docs/guides/` for advanced configuration

### With CLAUDE.md (Developer Instructions)
CLAUDE.md serves as the developer's companion to this documentation:
- Links to `docs/developer/` for contribution processes
- References `docs/architecture/` for system understanding
- Points to `docs/design/` for decision context

### With Examples Directory
The root `/examples/` directory contains:
- Configuration files and scripts
- Sample data and test cases
- Integration examples

Documentation in `docs/examples/` explains how to use these files.

## 🚀 Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Updates
