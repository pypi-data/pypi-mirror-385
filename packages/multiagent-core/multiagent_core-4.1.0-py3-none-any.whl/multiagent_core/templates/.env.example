# This file is for VS Code and other desktop apps that can't read ~/.bashrc
# DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE - it's auto-generated by /mcp:add commands
#
# How it works:
#   1. You run: /mcp:add postman
#   2. Command reads API key from ~/.bashrc environment
#   3. Command writes ACTUAL VALUE to this .env file
#   4. VS Code Copilot loads from this .env file
#   5. Claude Code loads from ~/.bashrc directly (doesn't need this file)
