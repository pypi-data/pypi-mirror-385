Read: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for full instructions

STEP 1: VERIFY YOU ARE IN YOUR WORKTREE
Run these commands:
  pwd
  git branch --show-current

Expected output:
  pwd should show: ../PROJECT-worktrees/claude
  branch should show: agent-claude-XXX (XXX = spec number)

If not in worktree:
  git worktree list
  cd ../PROJECT-worktrees/claude
  git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main

STEP 2: FIND YOUR TASKS
  grep "@claude" specs/XXX-*/agent-tasks/layered-tasks.md

UNDERSTANDING LAYER DEPENDENCIES:
  Layer N depends on Layer N-1 means:
    - If previous layer is complete, current layer is UNBLOCKED
    - All tasks within same layer can run in PARALLEL
    - Example: "Layer 5 depends on Layer 4" means if Layer 4 is done, ALL Layer 5 tasks are ready

STEP 3: UPDATE TASKS AS YOU WORK
Mark tasks complete in layered-tasks.md with [x]
Update your todo list as you complete work
Check off each task immediately after finishing

STEP 4: COMMIT AFTER EACH TASK
After completing EACH task:
  git add -A
  git commit -m "[WORKING] Completed TXXX: brief description"

When ALL assigned tasks are complete:
  git push -u origin agent-claude-XXX
  gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body "Summary of all tasks"

CRITICAL RULES:
NO hardcoded API keys or absolute paths
COMMIT after each task completion (not just at end)
CREATE PR only when ALL assigned tasks complete
Work ONLY in your assigned worktree
