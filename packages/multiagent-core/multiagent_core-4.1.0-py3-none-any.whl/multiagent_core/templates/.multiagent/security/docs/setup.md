# 🚨 COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY SETUP - PREVENT $2300 API KEY DISASTERS

## 🛡️ Multi-Layer Security Strategy

After learning the hard way that exposed API keys can cost **$2,300+ in unauthorized charges**, we've implemented a bulletproof 4-layer security system:

### Layer 1: LOCAL PROTECTION (Pre-commit Hooks)
### Layer 2: REPOSITORY PROTECTION (.gitignore + GitHub Workflows) 
### Layer 3: GITHUB SECRET SCANNING (Built-in Detection)
### Layer 4: MONITORING & ALERTS (Daily Scans)

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (All Projects)

### For New Projects:
```bash
# 1. Run setup script (includes all security)
/path/to/multiagent-core/scripts/setup-env.sh

# 2. Install local secret protection
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# 3. Enable GitHub secret scanning (see GitHub Setup below)
```

### For Existing Projects:
```bash
# 1. Copy security files
cp /path/to/multiagent-core/.github/workflows/security-scan.yml .github/workflows/
cp /path/to/multiagent-core/.multiagent/templates/.pre-commit-config.yaml .
cp /path/to/multiagent-core/.multiagent/templates/.gitignore .gitignore.new

# 2. Merge .gitignore carefully (don't overwrite existing)
# 3. Install pre-commit: pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
```

## � Slack MCP & Feedback Automation Configuration

To keep human approval audits compliant, configure the Slack MCP integration and retention timers in your project `.env` (values default from `.multiagent/templates/env.template`):

| Variable | Purpose | Recommended Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SLACK_MCP_SERVER_URL` | Base URL for the Slack MCP server handling approval notifications | *(set to your MCP gateway)* |
| `SLACK_MCP_APP_ID` | MCP application identifier used for authentication | *(required if your gateway enforces app scoping)* |
| `SLACK_MCP_DEFAULT_CHANNEL` | Slack channel for approval and override alerts | `#security-automation` |
| `APPROVAL_SLA_HOURS` | Maximum wait time before escalating unattended approvals | `24` |
| `TRANSCRIPT_RETENTION_DAYS` | Number of days to retain SDK transcripts before purge | `90` |
| `TRANSCRIPT_STORAGE_PATH` | Relative path where transcripts are archived | `.multiagent/feedback/logs` |

> ⚠️ **Security Reminder**: Keep MCP credentials (tokens, app IDs) out of source control. Store them in your secrets manager and populate at deploy time.

## �📋 Layer 1: LOCAL PROTECTION (Blocks Before Commit)

### Pre-commit Hooks Setup:
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks in your project
pre-commit install

# Test it works
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDangerous123" > test-secret.txt
git add test-secret.txt
git commit -m "test"  # 🚨 SHOULD BE BLOCKED!
```

### What Gets Blocked Locally:
- ✅ **API Keys**: Google, OpenAI, GitHub tokens
- ✅ **Environment Files**: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`
- ✅ **Key Files**: `.pem`, `.key`, `.p12`, `.pfx`
- ✅ **GEMINI.md Files**: Specifically your dangerous file type
- ✅ **Large Files**: > 1MB (prevents accidental uploads)
- ✅ **Private Keys**: SSH keys, certificates

---

## 📋 Layer 2: REPOSITORY PROTECTION (GitHub Workflows)

### Automated Security Scanning:
- **Triggers**: Every push, pull request, daily at 2 AM
- **Tools**: TruffleHog + GitLeaks (dual secret detection)
- **Action**: **BLOCKS** builds if secrets detected
- **Coverage**: Full git history scanning

### What Happens When Secrets Found:
```
🚨 SECURITY ALERT: Secrets detected in repository!
This build is BLOCKED until secrets are removed.

Common secrets that trigger this:
- API keys (Google, OpenAI, GitHub tokens)  
- Database passwords
- Private keys (.pem, .key files)
- GEMINI.md files with API keys

To fix:
1. Remove secrets from files
2. Add them to .gitignore  
3. Use environment variables instead
4. Store secrets in GitHub Secrets
```

---

## 📋 Layer 3: GITHUB SECRET SCANNING (Built-in)

### Enable GitHub's Native Secret Scanning:

#### For Public Repositories (FREE):
1. Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Code security**
2. Enable **Secret scanning**
3. Enable **Push protection** (CRITICAL!)
4. **Secret scanning** is automatically enabled

#### For Private Repositories (GitHub Pro/Team):
1. Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Code security**
2. Enable **Secret scanning** 
3. Enable **Push protection**
4. Enable **Validity checks** (verifies if secrets are active)

#### Organization-Wide Settings:
```bash
# Enable for ALL repositories in your organization:
# Go to Organization Settings → Code security → Global settings
# Enable: "Secret scanning" and "Push protection" for all repos
```

### GitHub Secret Scanning Features:
- ✅ **150+ Secret Types**: Google API keys, AWS, Azure, GitHub tokens, etc.
- ✅ **Push Protection**: Blocks pushes containing secrets
- ✅ **Historical Scanning**: Scans entire git history
- ✅ **Partner Alerts**: Notifies service providers (Google, AWS, etc.)
- ✅ **Validity Checks**: Tests if secrets are still active

---

## 📋 Layer 4: MONITORING & ALERTS

### Daily Automated Monitoring:
- **Schedule**: Every day at 2 AM UTC
- **Full Repo Scan**: Dependencies + secrets + vulnerabilities  
- **GitHub Security Tab**: All findings reported centrally
- **Artifact Storage**: 30-day retention of security reports

### Manual Security Audit:
```bash
# Run comprehensive local scan
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/pwd" trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest filesystem --directory=/pwd

# Check for secrets in git history
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/path" zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect --source="/path" -v

# Python-specific security scan
pip install bandit safety
bandit -r .
safety check
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL: What Would Have Prevented Your $2,300 Loss

### The GEMINI.md Incident Analysis:

**What Happened:**
- GEMINI.md file with API key committed to public repo
- File remained in git history even after deletion
- Unauthorized usage: $400+ in single day, $2,300+ total exposure

**How Our Security Would Have Stopped It:**

#### ✅ Layer 1 (Pre-commit):
```bash
# This would have BLOCKED the commit locally:
git add GEMINI.md
git commit -m "add gemini config"
# 🚨 BLOCKED: GEMINI.md files contain API keys!
```

#### ✅ Layer 2 (GitHub Workflow):
```yaml
# TruffleHog would detect: "COMPROMISED_KEY_REMOVED"
# GitLeaks would detect: Google API key pattern
# BUILD BLOCKED until removed
```

#### ✅ Layer 3 (GitHub Native):
```
🚨 Push protection enabled: Push blocked
Google API key detected in GEMINI.md
This secret is ACTIVE and poses a security risk
```

#### ✅ Layer 4 (Monitoring):
```
Daily scan at 2 AM would have caught it
GitHub Security tab would show CRITICAL alert
Artifact retention allows forensic analysis
```

**Result**: **ANY of these 4 layers would have prevented the $2,300 loss!**

## 📋 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

### If Secret Accidentally Committed:

#### 🚨 IMMEDIATE (Within Minutes):
```bash
# 1. REVOKE the secret immediately
# Google: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials  
# GitHub: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

# 2. Remove from latest commit (if not pushed yet)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
# Remove secret from files
git add . && git commit -m "remove secrets"

# 3. If already pushed - FORCE REWRITE HISTORY
git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch SECRETFILE.txt' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
git push --force origin main
```

#### 🔧 FOLLOW-UP (Within Hours):
```bash  
# 1. Generate new API keys with restricted permissions
# 2. Update .gitignore to prevent similar files

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Pre-commit Not Working:
```bash
# Reinstall hooks
pre-commit uninstall
pre-commit install

# Update hook versions  
pre-commit autoupdate

# Test specific hook
pre-commit run detect-secrets --all-files
```

### False Positives in Secret Detection:
```bash
# Add to .secrets.baseline (for detect-secrets)
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline

# Exclude files in .pre-commit-config.yaml:
exclude: |
  (?x)^(
    \.git/.*|
    path/to/false/positive\.txt
  )$
```

### GitHub Workflow Failing:
```bash
# Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
# Common issues:
# - Missing GITLEAKS_LICENSE secret
# - Repository not public (some features require Pro)
# - Workflow permissions issues
```

## 🚨 **NEVER AGAIN POLICY**

With this 4-layer security system:
- ✅ **Local commits** with secrets are **BLOCKED**
- ✅ **GitHub pushes** with secrets are **BLOCKED** 
- ✅ **Daily scans** catch any that slip through
- ✅ **Billing alerts** prevent surprise charges
- ✅ **Emergency procedures** minimize damage

**Your $2,300 lesson learned is now protecting every future project!**

## 📞 SUPPORT

If secrets still get through all 4 layers:
1. **Check this doc** - likely a configuration issue
2. **Review GitHub Security tab** - centralized findings
3. **Update security tools** - `pre-commit autoupdate` 
4. **Test with fake secrets** - verify detection works

**Remember**: The cost of implementing this security (a few hours) vs the cost of NOT implementing it ($2,300+) makes this the highest ROI security investment possible!
