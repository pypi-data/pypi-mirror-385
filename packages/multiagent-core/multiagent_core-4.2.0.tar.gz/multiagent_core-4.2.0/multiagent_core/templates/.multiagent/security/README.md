# Security System - Preventing $2,300+ API Key Disasters

## Purpose

Prevents accidental secret exposure through 4-layer security: .gitignore protection, git hooks, GitHub Actions scanning, and documentation. Triggered automatically during project setup.

## What It Does

1. **Deploys .gitignore** - Blocks dangerous files (.env, *.key, GEMINI.md, etc.)
2. **Creates .env.example** - Safe-to-commit template with placeholder values
3. **Installs git hooks** - Pre-push secret detection from core
4. **Generates GitHub workflows** - Security scanning on every push (Bandit, Semgrep, Safety)
5. **Scans existing code** - Detects any already-committed secrets
6. **Validates compliance** - Ensures all security measures active
7. **Creates documentation** - Security guides in `security/` directory
8. **Reports status** - Detailed setup report back to @claude

## Agents Used

- **@claude/security-auth-compliance** - Executes complete 8-step security deployment
- **@claude (coordinator)** - Analyzes project, prepares context, invokes security agent

## How It's Triggered

**Automatic via `/core:project-setup <spec-dir>`:**
1. @claude analyzes your project (tech stack, required secrets, current posture)
2. @claude invokes security-auth-compliance subagent with context
3. Subagent executes 8-step deployment
4. @claude validates and reports completion

**Result**: 4-layer security protection with zero manual configuration

## Commands

### `/security:setup` - Complete Security Infrastructure
Security is **automatically triggered** by `/core:project-setup`. No manual security commands needed - it's all orchestrated automatically.

**What it does:**
- Deploys .gitignore protection
- Installs git hooks (pre-push secret scanning)
- Generates GitHub workflows (security-scanning.yml)
- Scans existing code for secrets
- Creates security documentation

**Manual trigger (if needed):**
- Security setup runs automatically via `/core:project-setup`
- Git hooks: Installed at `.git/hooks/pre-push` (blocks secrets)
- GitHub workflows: Generated at `.github/workflows/security-scanning.yml`

### `/security:create-env create` - Environment File Generation
**NEW:** Generates comprehensive .env files by analyzing your entire project structure.

**What it does:**
1. Runs `~/.multiagent/security/scripts/analyze-project-keys.sh` (mechanical file discovery)
2. Invokes `env-generator` agent to analyze ALL discovered files
3. Generates `.env` organized by service type (AI, Communication, Data, Business, Infrastructure)
4. Adds source annotations showing where each key was found
5. Includes dashboard URLs for obtaining keys
6. Updates .gitignore

**Service categories:**
- AI/LLM (anthropic, openai, cohere, etc.)
- Memory Systems (mem0, pinecone, weaviate, etc.)
- Communication (sendgrid, twilio, etc.)
- Data & Storage (airtable, postgresql, redis, etc.)
- Business Services (stripe, signalhire, etc.)
- Infrastructure (vercel, aws, digitalocean, etc.)
- MCP Servers (production only - dev uses ~/.bashrc)

**Usage:**
```bash
/security:create-env create   # Generate initial .env
/security:create-env update   # Add new keys after dependencies change
```

**Agent:** `env-generator` (analyzes specs, docs, code, configs intelligently)
**Script:** `analyze-project-keys.sh` (mechanical file listing only)
**Template:** `~/.multiagent/security/templates/env/.env.template`

## ü§ñ Agent Workflow Details

### @claude - Strategic Coordinator

**Your Responsibilities**:
1. **Project Analysis**
   - Detect project tech stack (Node.js, Python, etc.)
   - Identify what secrets project needs (API keys, tokens, credentials)
   - Assess existing security posture
   - Determine compliance requirements

2. **Context Preparation**
   - Read project structure with Glob tool
   - Analyze package.json / requirements.txt for dependencies
   - Check if .env or secrets already exist (Read tool)
   - Prepare detailed context for security agent

3. **Subagent Invocation**
   ```
   Task(
       subagent_type="security-auth-compliance",
       description="Setup comprehensive project security",
       prompt="""
       Project: {project_name}
       Tech Stack: {detected_stack}
       Required Secrets: {api_keys_needed}
       Existing Security: {current_state}

       Execute security setup:
       1. Deploy .gitignore from templates/
       2. Create .env.example with project-specific variables
       3. Install git hooks to .git/hooks/
       4. Generate GitHub workflows to .github/workflows/
       5. Scan codebase for existing secrets
       6. Validate all security measures active

       Report: Security status and any issues found
       """
   )
   ```

4. **Post-Work Validation**
   - Verify .gitignore exists in project root
   - Confirm .env.example created
   - Check git hooks installed and executable
   - Validate GitHub workflows present
   - Review agent's security report

### security-auth-compliance Subagent - Security Executor

**Built-in Tools** (no scripts needed for most operations):
- **Read** - Read templates from `security/templates/`
- **Write** - Create files in project root and security/ output
- **Edit** - Merge new patterns into existing files
- **MultiEdit** - Bulk updates across multiple files
- **Bash** - Make hooks executable, run scripts, git commands
- **Grep** - Search codebase for secret patterns
- **Glob** - Find all files to scan for secrets

**When Agent Uses Scripts** (minimal - for bulk operations):
- `scripts/scan-secrets.sh` - Pattern matcher for 25+ secret types
- `scripts/validate-compliance.sh` - Checklist validation
- `scripts/generate-github-workflows.sh` - Copy workflow templates

**Complete Agent Workflow** (ALL Steps):

```markdown
### Step 1: Deploy .gitignore Protection
**Purpose**: Block dangerous files from git commits
**Actions**:
- Read: .multiagent/security/templates/.gitignore
- Check: Does project root .gitignore exist?
  - YES: Edit to merge security patterns
  - NO: Write new .gitignore to project root
- Verify: Critical patterns present (.env, *.key, *.pem, GEMINI.md, etc.)

### Step 2: Create .env.example Template
**Purpose**: Safe-to-commit environment variable documentation
**Actions**:
- Read: .multiagent/security/templates/env.template
- Analyze: Project dependencies for required secrets (package.json, requirements.txt)
- Customize: Add project-specific variables
- Write: .env.example to project root with placeholders
- Note: User copies to .env and fills real values

### Step 3: Install Git Hooks
**Purpose**: Pre-push secret scanning, post-commit auto-sync
**Actions**:
- Verify: .git directory exists
- Read: .multiagent/security/hooks/pre-push (security hook)
- Read: .multiagent/agents/hooks/post-commit (agent workflow hook)
- Write: Both hooks to .git/hooks/
- Bash: chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/post-commit
- Test: Verify hooks are executable

### Step 4: Generate GitHub Workflows
**Purpose**: CI/CD security scanning on every push
**Actions**:
- Check: .github/workflows/ directory exists (create if needed)

  - Replaces {{PROJECT_NAME}}, {{TECH_STACK}} placeholders
- Verify: Both workflow files created

### Step 5: Scan for Existing Secrets
**Purpose**: Detect any already-committed secrets
**Actions**:
- Bash: scripts/scan-secrets.sh
- If secrets found:
  - Report exact file:line locations
  - Mark as CRITICAL issue
  - Block further setup until resolved
  - Provide remediation steps
- If clean: Proceed to validation

### Step 6: Validate Security Compliance
**Purpose**: Verify all security measures active
**Actions**:
- Bash: scripts/validate-compliance.sh
- Check:
  - ‚úÖ .gitignore exists with security patterns
  - ‚úÖ Git hooks installed and executable
  - ‚úÖ .env not committed to git
  - ‚úÖ .env.example present
  - ‚úÖ GitHub workflows generated
- Report: Compliance status

### Step 7: Generate Security Output Directory
**Purpose**: Create documentation, reports, and configuration
**Actions**:
- Create: security/reports/
- Write: security/reports/security-setup-report.md (setup summary)
- Write: security/reports/compliance-check.md (compliance status)
- Write: security/reports/secret-scan-results.md (scan findings)
- Create: security/docs/
- Write: security/docs/SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md (secret handling guide)
- Write: security/docs/SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md (pre-deployment checklist)
- Write: security/docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md (emergency procedures)
- Create: security/configs/
- Write: security/configs/security-config.json (security configuration)

### Step 8: Security Setup Report
**Purpose**: Final status report to @claude
**Actions**:
- TodoWrite: Mark all steps completed
- Return report:
  - ‚úÖ Files created (.gitignore, .env.example, hooks, workflows)
  - ‚úÖ Security patterns deployed
  - ‚úÖ Secrets scanned (clean/issues found)
  - ‚úÖ Compliance validated
  - ‚úÖ Output generated (security/ directory)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Any issues requiring user action
  - üìã Next steps (create .env, test hooks, push to GitHub)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Layers

### Layer 1: .gitignore Protection
**File**: `templates/.gitignore` (7,985 bytes)
**Blocks**:
```gitignore
# SECURITY & SECRETS
.env
.env.*
!.env.template
!.env.example
*.key
*.pem
*.p12
*.pfx
secrets/
GEMINI.md          # The $2,300 disaster file!
api_keys.*
*_key
*_secret
*_token
```

**Deployed To**: Project root `.gitignore`
**Agent Action**: Read template ‚Üí Write/Edit to project root

---

### Layer 2: Pre-Push Hook (from core)
**File**: `../core/scripts/hooks/pre-push`
**Purpose**: Block pushes containing secrets
**Patterns Detected**: 25+ including:
- Google API keys: `AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}`
- OpenAI keys: `sk-[0-9A-Za-z]{48}`
- GitHub tokens: `ghp_[0-9A-Za-z]{36}`
- AWS credentials: `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`
- Private keys: `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
- GEMINI.md files (the $2,300 disaster!)

**Deployed To**: `.git/hooks/pre-push` (executable)
**Agent Action**: Read from core ‚Üí Write to .git/hooks/ ‚Üí Bash: chmod +x

---

### Layer 3: Post-Commit Hook (from core)
**File**: `../core/scripts/hooks/post-commit`
**Purpose**: Auto-sync templates on meaningful commits
**Features**:
- Triggers template sync to all registered projects
- Ensures security updates propagate automatically

**Deployed To**: `.git/hooks/post-commit` (executable)
**Agent Action**: Read from core ‚Üí Write to .git/hooks/ ‚Üí Bash: chmod +x

---

### Layer 4: GitHub Actions Security Scanning
**Files**:
- `templates/github-workflows/security-scan.yml.template`
- `templates/github-workflows/security-scanning.yml.template`

**Purpose**: CI/CD security validation on every push
**Capabilities**:
- Secret pattern detection (same 25+ patterns as hooks)
- Python dependency vulnerability scanning (Safety)
- Static security analysis (Bandit, Semgrep)
- Weekly automated scans
- Pull request security validation

**Deployed To**: `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (project-specific)
**Agent Action**: Bash: scripts/generate-github-workflows.sh

**Key Point**: Templates stay in `security/templates/github-workflows/` - they are NOT synced from repo `.github/`. Each project gets customized workflows generated by the security agent.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Architecture Notes

### 1. Templates vs Live Files
- **Templates**: `.multiagent/security/templates/` (source, never executed)
- **Live Files**: Project root (deployed by agent, actively protect)

### 2. GitHub Workflows NOT Synced
- **Repo .github/**: Only repo-specific workflows
- **Project .github/**: Generated per-project by security agent
- **Why**: Each project needs customized workflows (project name, tech stack)

### 3. Hooks Organized by Concern
- **Security**: `.multiagent/security/hooks/pre-push` (secret scanning)
- **Agents**: `.multiagent/agents/hooks/post-commit` (workflow guidance)
- **Why**: Each subsystem owns its hooks based on primary purpose

### 4. Scripts Are Tools
- NOT orchestrators - agents do the work
- ONLY used for complex validation/pattern matching
- Agents call scripts, scripts don't call agents

---

**Remember**: This system exists because of a $2,300 mistake. Every security layer is designed to ensure that never happens again to any project using this framework.
