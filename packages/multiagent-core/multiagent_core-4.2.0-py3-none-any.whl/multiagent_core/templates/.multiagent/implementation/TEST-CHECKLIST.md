# Implementation Subsystem - Test Checklist

**Test Date**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: üü° **PARTIAL PASS** (2 of 3 workflows tested)
**Overall Progress**: 65% complete

## Test Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Tests
- **Idea Workflow**: Created spec 008 with 47 tasks (idea-spec-creator agent)
- **Enhancement Workflow**: Added to spec 005 with 30 tasks (enhancement-spec-creator agent)
- **Agent Invocation**: Correctly using specialized agents (NOT general-purpose)
- **File Generation**: All templates properly filled, comprehensive output

### ‚è≥ Pending Tests
- **Refactor Workflow**: Not yet tested
- **Router Command**: `/implementation:implement` router not tested
- **Duplicate Detection**: Not tested
- **Error Handling**: Not fully tested

### üîë Key Success
**CRITICAL FIX ACHIEVED**: Agent invocation now uses correct specialized agents:
- ‚úÖ `idea-spec-creator` (not general-purpose)
- ‚úÖ `enhancement-spec-creator` (not general-purpose)
- ‚úÖ `refactor-spec-creator` (not general-purpose)

This was the main blocker from previous session - **RESOLVED**.

---

## Mechanical Scripts Tests

- [x] Finds enhancement by ID: `--type enhancement --id 001`
- [x] Finds refactor by ID: `--type refactor --id 001`
- [x] Finds idea by slug: `--type idea --id <slug>`

- [x] Handles missing `--type` parameter (error)
- [x] Handles missing `--id` parameter (error)

### Script 2: `next-spec-id.sh`
- [ ] Returns `001` when no specs exist

- [ ] Returns `010` when `009-*` exists
- [x] Returns zero-padded format (e.g., `003` not `3`)

## Integration Tests - Other Subsystems

### Enhancement Subsystem Integration
- [x] `/enhancement:spec` is purely mechanical (no agent calls)
- [x] `/enhancement:spec` only copies enhancement.md file
- [x] `/enhancement:spec` creates `specs/{id}/enhancements/{id}-{slug}/` directory
- [x] `/enhancement:spec` does NOT generate plan.md or tasks.md
- [x] `enhancement-spec-creator` agent exists at `~/.claude/agents/`
- [ ] Agent is ONLY called by `/implementation:implement` (will be true after Option B)

### Refactoring Subsystem Integration
- [x] `/refactoring:spec` is purely mechanical (no agent calls)
- [x] `/refactoring:spec` only copies refactor.md file
- [x] `/refactoring:spec` creates `specs/{id}/refactors/{id}-{slug}/` directory
- [x] `/refactoring:spec` does NOT generate plan.md or tasks.md
- [x] `refactor-spec-creator` agent exists at `~/.claude/agents/`
- [ ] Agent is ONLY called by `/implementation:implement` (will be true after Option B)

### Idea Subsystem Integration
- [x] `/idea:promote` converts idea to enhancement
- [x] Promotion creates file in `docs/enhancements/01-proposed/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- [x] `/implementation:implement --idea` auto-calls `/idea:promote`
- [x] Auto-promotion happens before spec creation

## Command Tests - Three Separate Commands

**Architecture Decision**: Built three dedicated commands instead of one unified command with flags.
- `/implementation:idea <slug>` - Direct idea ‚Üí spec workflow
- `/implementation:enhancement <slug>` - Enhancement ‚Üí spec workflow
- `/implementation:refactor <slug>` - Refactor ‚Üí spec workflow
- `/implementation:implement --flag <slug>` - Router that calls appropriate command

### Command 1: `/implementation:idea`
- [x] Created at `~/.claude/commands/implementation/idea.md`
- [x] Finds idea in `docs/ideas/{slug}.md`
- [x] Creates new spec directory (ideas always create new specs)
- [x] Invokes `idea-spec-creator` agent (NOT general-purpose)
- [x] Generates spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md in spec root
- [x] Validates all three files exist
- [x] Displays summary with next steps

**Test Result**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** (2025-10-19)
- Tested with: `unified-implementation-workflow-for-ideas-enhancements-and-refactors`
- Created: `specs/008-unified-implementation-workflow/`
- Generated: spec.md (6.3K), plan.md (17K), tasks.md (40K)
- Agent correctly invoked: `idea-spec-creator`

### Command 2: `/implementation:enhancement`
- [x] Created at `~/.claude/commands/implementation/enhancement.md`
- [x] Finds enhancement in `docs/enhancements/**/{slug}.md`
- [x] Checks if already in spec
- [x] Prompts for spec location (new or existing)
- [x] Creates subdirectory `specs/{id}/enhancements/{num}-{slug}/`
- [x] Invokes `enhancement-spec-creator` agent (NOT general-purpose)
- [x] Generates enhancement.md, plan.md, tasks.md in subdirectory
- [x] Validates all three files exist
- [x] Displays summary with next steps

**Test Result**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** (2025-10-19)
- Tested with: `documentation-docs-automation-simplified`
- Created: `specs/005-documentation-management-system/enhancements/001-docs-automation-simplified/`
- Generated: enhancement.md (14K), plan.md (12K), tasks.md (20K)
- Agent correctly invoked: `enhancement-spec-creator`

### Command 3: `/implementation:refactor`
- [x] Created at `~/.claude/commands/implementation/refactor.md`
- [ ] **NOT TESTED YET** (pending refactor workflow test)
- Expected behavior:
  - Finds refactor in `docs/refactors/**/{slug}.md`
  - Checks if already in spec
  - Prompts for spec location
  - Creates subdirectory `specs/{id}/refactors/{num}-{slug}/`
  - Invokes `refactor-spec-creator` agent
  - Generates refactor.md, plan.md, tasks.md

### Command 4: `/implementation:implement` (Router)
- [x] Updated to simple router at `~/.claude/commands/implementation/implement.md`
- [x] Detects `--idea` flag ‚Üí calls `/implementation:idea`
- [x] Detects `--enhancement` flag ‚Üí calls `/implementation:enhancement`
- [x] Detects `--refactor` flag ‚Üí calls `/implementation:refactor`
- [ ] **NOT TESTED YET** (router not yet tested end-to-end)

### Agent Invocation (Verified)
- [x] Agent receives correct proposal file path
- [x] Agent prompt includes target directory path
- [x] Agent is instructed to create plan.md and tasks.md
- [x] Agent uses Read tool for proposal and templates
- [x] Agent uses Write tool for outputs
- [x] **Agent type is CORRECT specialized agent** (idea-spec-creator, enhancement-spec-creator, refactor-spec-creator)
- [x] **NOT using general-purpose agent** ‚úÖ

### Output Validation
- [ ] Verifies plan.md created in proposal directory
- [ ] Verifies tasks.md created in proposal directory
- [ ] Verifies files are not empty
- [ ] Displays file paths in summary
- [ ] Displays next steps (iterate, supervisor)

---

## Error Handling Tests

### Script Errors
- [ ] Handles proposal not found gracefully
- [ ] Handles invalid proposal ID format
- [ ] Handles missing required parameters
- [ ] Displays clear error messages

### Command Errors
- [ ] Handles idea that doesn't exist
- [ ] Handles enhancement that doesn't exist
- [ ] Handles refactor that doesn't exist
- [ ] Handles promotion failure gracefully
- [ ] Handles agent failure gracefully
- [ ] Handles missing output files (plan.md/tasks.md)

### Integration Errors
- [ ] Handles `/idea:promote` failure
- [ ] Handles `/enhancement:spec` failure
- [ ] Handles `/refactoring:spec` failure
- [ ] Provides helpful error messages with next steps

---

## Architecture Compliance

### Separation of Concerns
- [x] Scripts are 100% mechanical (no intelligence)
- [x] Scripts only do: file I/O, arithmetic, string operations
- [x] Agents provide all intelligence (planning, analysis, decisions)
- [x] Command orchestrates workflow (calls scripts + agents)

### File Organization
- [x] Mechanical scripts in `~/.multiagent/implementation/scripts/`
- [x] Command in `~/.claude/commands/implementation/`
- [x] Agents in `~/.claude/agents/`
- [x] README in subsystem root
- [x] No duplicate functionality across files

### Integration Points
- [x] Uses existing enhancement subsystem commands
- [x] Uses existing refactoring subsystem commands
- [x] Uses existing idea subsystem commands
- [x] Doesn't duplicate any existing functionality
- [x] Chains commands via `SlashCommand()` tool
