"""WebSocket room management for Gobstopper framework.

This module provides a comprehensive WebSocket connection manager with room-based
organization for building real-time applications like chat systems, live dashboards,
collaborative editing, and multiplayer games.

The WebSocketManager class offers:
- Centralized connection tracking and lifecycle management
- Room-based organization for targeted message broadcasting
- Automatic cleanup of dead connections
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Efficient broadcast mechanisms for one-to-many communication

Key Concepts:
    Connection: Individual WebSocket client identified by unique connection_id
    Room: Named group of connections that can receive broadcasts together
    Broadcast: Sending messages to multiple connections simultaneously

Architecture:
    The manager maintains two key data structures:
    - connections: Dict mapping connection_id -> WebSocket instance
    - rooms: Dict mapping room_name -> Set of connection_ids

    This separation allows:
    - O(1) connection lookups
    - O(1) room membership checks
    - Efficient multi-room membership per connection
    - Easy cleanup when connections close

Use Cases:
    Chat rooms: Users join named chat rooms to exchange messages
    Live updates: Broadcast data updates to subscribers of specific topics
    Notifications: Send alerts to specific user groups
    Gaming: Manage players in different game lobbies
    Collaboration: Sync state across users editing the same document

Examples:
    Basic chat room implementation:

    >>> from gobstopper import Gobstopper
    >>> from gobstopper.websocket import WebSocketManager
    >>> import uuid
    >>>
    >>> app = Gobstopper()
    >>> manager = WebSocketManager()
    >>>
    >>> @app.websocket("/ws/chat/<room>")
    >>> async def chat_handler(websocket, room):
    ...     conn_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    ...     await websocket.accept()
    ...     manager.add_connection(conn_id, websocket)
    ...     manager.join_room(conn_id, room)
    ...
    ...     try:
    ...         while True:
    ...             message = await websocket.receive()
    ...             if message.type == "close":
    ...                 break
    ...             if message.type == "text":
    ...                 await manager.broadcast_to_room(room, message.data)
    ...     finally:
    ...         manager.remove_connection(conn_id)

    Multi-room user presence:

    >>> @app.websocket("/ws/notifications")
    >>> async def notification_handler(websocket):
    ...     conn_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    ...     await websocket.accept()
    ...     manager.add_connection(conn_id, websocket)
    ...
    ...     # User can join multiple notification topics
    ...     manager.join_room(conn_id, "global")
    ...     manager.join_room(conn_id, f"user_{user_id}")
    ...     manager.join_room(conn_id, f"team_{team_id}")
    ...
    ...     # Now receives broadcasts from all three rooms
    ...     while True:
    ...         message = await websocket.receive()
    ...         if message.type == "close":
    ...             break

    Admin broadcast to all users:

    >>> async def notify_all_users(message: str):
    ...     await manager.broadcast_to_all(message)

    Room statistics and monitoring:

    >>> def get_room_stats(room: str) -> dict:
    ...     connections = manager.get_room_connections(room)
    ...     return {
    ...         "room": room,
    ...         "active_users": len(connections),
    ...         "connection_ids": list(connections)
    ...     }

Security Considerations:
    - Always validate connection_ids to prevent injection attacks
    - Implement authentication before adding connections
    - Sanitize room names to prevent unauthorized access
    - Rate limit broadcast operations to prevent abuse
    - Monitor connection counts to detect DoS attempts

Performance Notes:
    - Room lookups are O(1) with hash-based dictionaries
    - Broadcasting is O(n) where n is room size
    - Connection cleanup is O(m) where m is number of rooms
    - Memory usage scales with: connections + (rooms Ã— avg_room_size)

class WebSocketManager:
    """Centralized WebSocket connection manager with room-based organization.

    Manages WebSocket connections with support for rooms (groups), broadcasting,
    and automatic connection lifecycle management. Designed for building real-time
    applications with many concurrent connections and targeted message delivery.

    The manager provides efficient data structures for:
    - Fast connection lookups by ID
    - Organizing connections into named rooms
    - Broadcasting messages to rooms or all connections
    - Tracking which rooms a connection belongs to
    - Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients

    Attributes:
        connections: Dictionary mapping connection_id (str) to WebSocket instances.
            Maintains all active WebSocket connections.
        rooms: Dictionary mapping room names (str) to Sets of connection_ids.
            Organizes connections into logical groups for targeted broadcasting.

    Thread Safety:
        This implementation is NOT thread-safe by default. For multi-threaded
        applications, wrap operations in locks or use asyncio's thread-safe
        primitives.

    Examples:
        Initialize manager and handle connections:

        >>> from gobstopper.websocket import WebSocketManager
        >>> manager = WebSocketManager()
        >>>
        >>> # In your WebSocket handler
        >>> conn_id = "user_123"
