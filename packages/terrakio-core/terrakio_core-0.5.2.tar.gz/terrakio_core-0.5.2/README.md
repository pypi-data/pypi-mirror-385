# Terrakio Core

Core components for Terrakio API clients. This package provides the foundational classes and utilities used by both the regular and admin API clients.

This package is typically not used directly but is a dependency for:
- `terrakio-api`: Regular user client
- `terrakio-admin-api`: Administrative client

For documentation and usage examples, see the [main repository](https://github.com/HaizeaAnalytics/terrakio-python-api).
