# This file exists for tools (or CI) that expect a requirements.txt for docs.
#
# Preferred: install the docs extras defined in `pyproject.toml` so you only
# have one source of truth for development and documentation dependencies:
#
#   pip install -e ".[docs]"
#
# Or include docs in your editable dev install:
#
#   pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
#
# If you still need a plain requirements file (for ReadTheDocs or similar),
# keep the minimal fallback below or generate a pinned list from pyproject.
