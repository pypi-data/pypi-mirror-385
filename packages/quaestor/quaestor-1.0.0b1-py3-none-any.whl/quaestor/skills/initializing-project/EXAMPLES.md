What would you prefer?
```

### User Response (Custom Architecture Path)
```
User: "Custom architecture description"
```

### My Follow-up
```
Please describe your project architecture. I'll use your description instead of the detected patterns.

What I'd like to know:
- Architecture pattern (if different from "Layered")
- Key components and responsibilities
- Design principles you're following
- Quality standards and testing strategy
```

### User Description
```
User: "We use Hexagonal Architecture with Domain-Driven Design. The domain layer is completely isolated, application layer orchestrates use cases, and infrastructure layer handles persistence and external APIs. We follow CQRS for complex operations and aim for 85% test coverage with property-based testing."
```

### My Confirmation
```
Got it! I'll document your architecture as:

- **Pattern**: Hexagonal Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
- **Layers**: Domain (isolated), Application (orchestration), Infrastructure (adapters)
- **Patterns**: CQRS for complex operations
- **Testing**: 85% coverage with property-based testing

Does this accurately represent your architecture?
```

### User Confirmation
```
User: "Yes, perfect"
```

### My Response - Phase 4 (Completion)
```
‚úÖ Initialization complete with your custom architecture!

**Generated Documentation:**
- .quaestor/AGENT.md

**Your Architecture:**
- Pattern: Hexagonal Architecture with Domain-Driven Design
- CQRS pattern documented
- 85% coverage target configured
- Property-based testing noted

**Installed Skills (10):**
[Same 10 skills]

**Next Steps:**
1. Review .quaestor/ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2 - your architecture is documented
2. Your custom testing strategy is in Section 5
3. Start implementing specifications with your architecture patterns
```

## Example 4: Minimal Setup for New Project

### User Request
```
User: "Initialize Quaestor in this project"
```

### Context
User has an empty/new project with minimal files.

### My Response - Phase 3 (Validation)
```
## Project Analysis Validation ‚úã

**Detected Configuration:**
- Framework: Unable to detect (minimal files found)
- Architecture: Unknown (new project)
- Complexity: 0.0/1.0 (new project)
- Phase: Startup (0-6 months)

**Quality Standards:**
- No existing quality tools detected
- No tests found
- No CI/CD configured

**Files Analyzed:**
- No significant project files found
- This appears to be a new project

**Recommendation:** Consider using minimal setup and configuring quality standards manually as your project develops.

## Your Options:
- ‚úÖ Proceed with detected setup (basic defaults)
- üîÑ Modify detected patterns
- üìù Custom architecture description
- üö´ Start with minimal setup (recommended for new projects)

What would you prefer?
```

### User Response
```
User: "Start with minimal setup"
```

### My Response - Phase 4 (Completion)
```
‚úÖ Minimal setup complete!

**Generated Documentation:**
- .quaestor/AGENT.md (standard workflow rules)
- .quaestor/ARCHITECTURE.md (template - customize as you develop)
- CLAUDE.md

**What to do next:**
1. Edit .quaestor/ARCHITECTURE.md as your project takes shape:
   - Fill in Section 1: Project Configuration
   - Define Section 2: Architecture Overview
   - Configure Section 3: Code Quality Standards (add commands as you adopt tools)

2. Install quality tools for your language/framework:
   - Python: `pip install ruff mypy pytest`
   - TypeScript: `npm install -D eslint prettier jest`
   - Rust: Already has clippy, rustfmt, cargo test

3. Return anytime to re-analyze:
   - "Analyze my project" to update configuration
   - Skills remain available for guidance

**Installed Skills (10):**
[Same 10 skills - including architecture-patterns for guidance]

**Minimal Structure Created:**
- .quaestor/specs/draft/
- .quaestor/specs/active/
- .quaestor/specs/completed/
- .quaestor/specs/archived/
```

## Example 5: Error Handling - Agent Failure

### Scenario
One or more agents fail during analysis.

### My Response (Graceful Degradation)
```
üîç Analyzing your project...

Spawning specialized agents:
- researcher: ‚úì Complete (Python FastAPI detected)
- architect: ‚ö† Timeout (10s limit reached)
- security: ‚úì Complete (No major issues)

Note: Architecture analysis incomplete. Using basic pattern detection.

## Project Analysis Validation ‚úã

**Detected Configuration:**
- Framework: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy
- Architecture: Basic pattern detection (architect agent timed out)
  - Detected: Repository pattern in infrastructure/
  - Detected: Domain models in domain/
  - Recommendation: Review and customize architecture section
- Complexity: 0.50/1.0 (estimated from available metrics)
- Phase: Growth (6-18 months)

**Quality Standards:**
- Testing: pytest detected
- Linting: ruff detected
- Type checking: mypy in pyproject.toml
- Security: No major vulnerabilities

**Files Analyzed:**
- pyproject.toml: Dependencies analyzed
- src/: Basic structure reviewed
- tests/: Test suite found

‚ö† **Note**: Architecture analysis was incomplete. The generated ARCHITECTURE.md will have a basic template in Section 2. Please review and customize it based on your actual architecture.

## Your Options:
- ‚úÖ Proceed with detected setup (with basic architecture template)
- üîÑ Modify detected patterns
- üìù Custom architecture description (recommended due to incomplete analysis)
- üö´ Start with minimal setup

What would you prefer?
```

This shows graceful degradation when agents fail - I continue with available data and clearly communicate limitations.
