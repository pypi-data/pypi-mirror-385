## Phase 1: Comprehensive Validation üîç

### Pre-Validation: Workflow Coordinator Check

**FIRST, use the workflow-coordinator agent to validate workflow state before review.**

```yaml
Workflow Coordinator Validates:
  - Implementation phase completed
  - All tasks in specification done
  - Tests passing before review
  - Ready for review/completion phase
  - No blocking issues remaining

If Not Ready:
  - Report incomplete work
  - Guide user to complete implementation
  - Do NOT proceed to validation
```

### Multi-Domain Quality Checks

---

## Phase 2: Intelligent Auto-Fixing ‚ö°

### Fix Classification

**Categorize Issues by Complexity:**

```yaml
Simple Issues (Direct Fix):
  - Formatting errors (prettier, rustfmt, black)
  - Import sorting (isort, organize imports)
  - Trailing whitespace cleanup
  - Simple type annotations (obvious types)
  - Missing semicolons or commas
  - Unused imports removal

  Strategy: Auto-fix immediately with tools

Complex Issues (Agent Delegation):
  - Test failures ‚Üí qa agent
  - Security vulnerabilities ‚Üí security agent
  - Performance regressions ‚Üí implementer agent
  - Documentation gaps ‚Üí implementer agent
  - Architecture concerns ‚Üí architect agent
  - Code quality issues ‚Üí refactorer agent

  Strategy: Delegate to specialized agent
```

### Simple Fix Execution

**Direct Auto-Fixing:**

```bash
# Python
ruff check . --fix              # Auto-fix linting
ruff format .                   # Format code
isort .                        # Sort imports

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npx prettier --write .         # Format code
npx eslint . --fix             # Fix linting

# Rust
cargo fmt                      # Format code
cargo clippy --fix             # Fix clippy warnings

# Go
gofmt -w .                     # Format code
go mod tidy                    # Clean dependencies
```

**Verification After Simple Fixes:**

```yaml
After Auto-Fix:
  1. Re-run validation tools
  2. Verify no new issues introduced
  3. Run quick test suite
  4. Report fixes applied
```

### Complex Fix Orchestration

**Agent Delegation Strategy:**

```yaml
Test Failures:
  Use the qa agent to:
    - Analyze failing tests
    - Identify root causes
    - Fix test implementation or code
    - Add missing test cases
    - Verify all tests pass

Security Vulnerabilities:
  Use the security agent to:
    - Review vulnerability details
    - Assess severity and impact
    - Implement secure fixes
    - Add security tests
    - Verify vulnerability resolved

Performance Issues:
  Use the implementer agent to:
    - Profile performance bottlenecks
    - Implement optimizations
    - Add performance tests
    - Verify no regressions

Documentation Gaps:
  Use the implementer agent to:
    - Add missing docstrings
    - Update API documentation
    - Add code examples
    - Update README if needed

Code Quality Issues:
  Use the refactorer agent to:
    - Refactor complex functions
    - Reduce code duplication
    - Improve naming consistency
    - Simplify logic flow
```

### Parallel Fix Execution

**Coordinate Multiple Agents:**

```yaml
Independent Issues (Parallel):
  Spawn simultaneously:
    - qa agent: Fix test failures in auth module
    - implementer agent: Add docs to API module
    - refactorer agent: Simplify parser logic

  Wait for all completions

  Validate combined result:
    - No conflicts introduced
    - All fixes applied successfully
    - Quality gates now passing

Dependent Issues (Sequential):
  Step 1: Use security agent to fix vulnerability
  Step 2: Use qa agent to add security tests
  Step 3: Use implementer agent to document fix
```

### Fix Verification

**Post-Fix Validation:**

```yaml
Verification Steps:
  1. Re-run all quality checks:
     - Linting: Should be clean
     - Tests: Should all pass
     - Security: Should be clean
     - Type checking: Should be valid

  2. Verify no regressions:
     - Run full test suite
     - Check no new issues introduced
     - Validate fixes don't break other areas

  3. Document changes:
     - Track what was fixed
     - Note any manual interventions
     - Update fix summary
```

### Fix Report

**Generate Fix Summary:**

```yaml
Auto-Fix Summary:

Simple Fixes Applied:
  - Formatting: 47 files formatted
  - Imports: 12 files sorted
  - Linting: 8 auto-fixable issues resolved

Agent Fixes Applied:
  - qa agent: Fixed 3 test failures in auth module
  - implementer agent: Added docstrings to 5 functions
  - security agent: Updated password hashing algorithm

Remaining Issues: 0

Validation Status: ‚úÖ All quality gates passing
```

## Phase 3: Smart Commit Generation üìù

### Change Analysis

**Analyze Uncommitted Changes:**

```bash
# Get all changes
git status --short
git diff --stat

# Analyze by type
git diff --name-only | sort
```

**Group Related Changes:**

```yaml
Grouping Strategy:
  By Module:
    - auth/ changes ‚Üí one commit
    - api/ changes ‚Üí one commit
    - utils/ changes ‚Üí one commit

  By Feature:
    - Feature implementation ‚Üí one commit
    - Tests for feature ‚Üí include in same commit
    - Documentation ‚Üí separate commit if extensive

  By Type:
    - Refactoring ‚Üí separate commit
    - Bug fixes ‚Üí separate commit
    - Feature additions ‚Üí one per feature
```

### Commit Classification

**Conventional Commit Types:**

```yaml
feat: New feature for the user
  Examples:
    - "feat(auth): implement JWT refresh tokens"
    - "feat(api): add user profile endpoint"
    - "feat(payments): integrate Stripe checkout"

fix: Bug fix for the user
  Examples:
    - "fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint"
    - "fix(auth): prevent token expiry race condition"
    - "fix(validation): correct email regex pattern"

docs: Documentation changes
  Examples:
    - "docs(api): update OpenAPI specifications"
    - "docs(readme): add installation instructions"
    - "docs(auth): document OAuth flow"

refactor: Code change that neither fixes nor adds feature
  Examples:
    - "refactor(parser): simplify token extraction"
    - "refactor(utils): extract common validation logic"
    - "refactor(auth): improve session management structure"

test: Adding or updating tests
  Examples:
    - "test(auth): add coverage for edge cases"
    - "test(api): add integration tests for user endpoints"
    - "test(utils): add unit tests for validators"

    - "style: format code with prettier"

chore: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config)
  Examples:
    - "chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions"
    - "chore(config): update linting rules"
```

### Scope Extraction

**Determine Commit Scope:**

```yaml
From File Paths:
  src/auth/jwt.py ‚Üí scope: auth
  src/api/users.py ‚Üí scope: api
  src/utils/validation.py ‚Üí scope: utils
  tests/test_auth.py ‚Üí scope: auth (test relates to auth)

From Specification:
  Spec: "spec-feature-auth-001"
  ‚Üí scope: auth

Multiple Scopes:
  Changes in auth/ and api/
  ‚Üí Option 1: Two commits (auth, api)
  ‚Üí Option 2: One commit with scope: auth,api
  ‚Üí Prefer: Separate commits for clarity
```

### Commit Message Generation

**Template Format:**

```yaml
Format: type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Generation Algorithm:**

```yaml
Step 1: Classify Changes
  - Analyze file diffs
  - Determine primary type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
  - Extract scope from file paths

Step 2: Generate Description
  - Summarize what changed (imperative mood)
  - Keep under 72 characters
  - Focus on "what" not "how"

  Examples:
    ‚úÖ "implement JWT refresh tokens"
    ‚úÖ "handle null response in user endpoint"
    ‚ùå "added some JWT code"
    ‚ùå "fixed a bug"

Step 3: Add Body (if needed)
  - Explain "why" the change was made
  - Describe implications or context
  - Reference specification or issue

  Example:
    "feat(auth): implement JWT refresh tokens

    Adds refresh token rotation for better security.
    Tokens expire after 15 minutes, refresh after 7 days.

    Implements spec-feature-auth-001 phase 2."

Step 4: Add Footer (if applicable)
  - Breaking changes: BREAKING CHANGE: description
  - Issue references: Closes #123
  - Specification: Spec: spec-feature-auth-001
```

### Atomic Commit Strategy

**One Logical Change Per Commit:**

```yaml
Good Atomic Commits:

Commit 1: feat(auth): implement JWT generation
  - src/auth/jwt.py (JWT generation logic)
  - tests/test_jwt.py (JWT generation tests)

Commit 2: feat(auth): implement JWT validation
  - src/auth/jwt.py (JWT validation logic)
  - tests/test_jwt.py (JWT validation tests)

Commit 3: docs(auth): document JWT implementation
  - docs/auth.md (JWT documentation)
  - README.md (update authentication section)

Bad Non-Atomic Commits:

Commit 1: "lots of changes"
  - src/auth/jwt.py (generation AND validation)
  - src/api/users.py (unrelated API changes)
  - docs/auth.md (documentation)
  - tests/test_jwt.py (tests)
  - README.md (readme update)

  Problem: Too many unrelated changes in one commit
```

### Specification Integration

**Link Commits to Specifications:**

```yaml
Commit Message with Spec Reference:
  feat(auth): implement JWT refresh tokens

  Implements spec-feature-auth-001 phase 2: Token Management

  - Add refresh token generation
  - Implement token rotation
  - Add token expiry validation

  Spec: spec-feature-auth-001

Track Progress:
  - Update specification file
  - Mark phase as completed
  - Add commit hash reference
  - Update completion evidence
```

### Commit Generation Output

**Generated Commits Summary:**

```yaml
Generated 3 Commits:

1. feat(auth): implement JWT refresh tokens
   Files: src/auth/jwt.py, tests/test_jwt.py
   Spec: spec-feature-auth-001 phase 2

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Validation Failures

**Quality Gate Failures:**

```yaml
Linting Errors:
  1. Attempt auto-fix: ruff check --fix, eslint --fix
  2. If persist: Use refactorer agent to fix
  3. Re-validate: Ensure clean
  4. If still failing: Report to user for manual fix

Test Failures:
  1. Analyze: Identify failing tests
  2. Use qa agent: Fix test or implementation
  3. Re-run: Verify all pass
  4. If persist: Detailed report to user

Security Vulnerabilities:
  1. Use security agent: Review and fix
  2. Update dependencies if needed
  3. Re-scan: Verify clean
  4. If critical unfixable: Block PR creation, report to user
```

### Fix Failures

**Agent Fix Issues:**

```yaml
Agent Unable to Fix:
  1. Document: What agent attempted
  2. Report: Detailed error information
  3. Guide: Suggest manual intervention
  4. Offer: Alternative approaches

Conflicting Fixes:
  1. Detect: Conflicts between agent fixes
  2. Analyze: Determine priority
  3. Resolve: Apply fixes sequentially
  4. Validate: Ensure no regressions
```

### Commit Generation Issues

**Commit Creation Problems:**

```yaml
No Changes to Commit:
  - Report: "No uncommitted changes found"

  - Guide: User to resolve manually

Invalid Commit Message:
  - Validate: Conventional commit format
  - Fix: Regenerate with correct format
  - Apply: Create commit with valid message
```

### PR Creation Failures

**GitHub PR Issues:**

```yaml
Branch Already Has PR:
  - Detect: Existing PR for branch
  - Report: Link to existing PR
  - Offer: Update existing PR instead

Authentication Failure:
  - Check: gh auth status
  - Guide: User to authenticate
  - Retry: After authentication

Network/API Error:
