# Specification Integration & Tracking

This file describes how to integrate with Quaestor's specification system for tracking implementation progress.

## Specification Folder Structure

```yaml
.quaestor/specs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ draft/           # Planned specifications (not yet started)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ active/          # In-progress implementations (max 3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed/       # Finished implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archived/        # Old/cancelled specifications
```

---

## Specification Lifecycle

### States and Transitions

```yaml
States:
  draft: "Specification created but not started"
  active: "Currently being implemented"
  completed: "Implementation finished and validated"
  archived: "Old or cancelled"

Transitions:
  draft ‚Üí active: "Start implementation"
  active ‚Üí completed: "Finish implementation"
  active ‚Üí draft: "Pause work"
  any ‚Üí archived: "Cancel or archive"

Limits:
  active: "Maximum 3 active specs"
  draft: "Unlimited"
  completed: "Unlimited"
  archived: "Unlimited"
```

---

## Phase 1: Specification Discovery

### No Arguments Provided

**Discovery Protocol:**
```yaml
Step 1: Check Active Specs
  Location: .quaestor/specs/active/*.md
  Purpose: Find in-progress work
  Output: List of active specifications

Step 2: Check Draft Specs (if no active)
  Location: .quaestor/specs/draft/*.md
  Purpose: Find available work
  Output: List of draft specifications

Step 3: Present to User
  Format:
    "Found 2 specifications:
     - [active] spec-feature-001: User Authentication
     - [draft] spec-feature-002: Data Export API

     Which would you like to work on?"

Step 4: User Selection
  User provides: spec ID or description
  Match: Find corresponding specification
  Activate: Move draft ‚Üí active (if needed)
```

### Arguments Provided

**Match Specification by ID or Description:**
```yaml
Argument Examples:
  - "spec-feature-001"
  - "feature-001"
  - "001"
  - "user authentication"
  - "auth system"

Matching Strategy:
  1. Exact ID match: spec-feature-001.md
  2. Partial ID match: Contains "feature-001"
  3. Description match: Title contains "user authentication"
  4. Fuzzy match: Similar words in title

Result:
  Match Found:
    ‚Üí Load specification
    ‚Üí Display: "Found: spec-feature-001 - User Authentication System"
    ‚Üí Activate if in draft/

  No Match:
    ‚Üí Display: "No matching specification found"
    ‚Üí Suggest: "Available specs: [list]"
    ‚Üí Ask: "Would you like to create a new spec?"
```

---

## Phase 2: Specification Activation

### Pre-Activation Validation

**Before Moving to Active:**
```yaml
Validation Checks:
  1. Spec Location:
     - If already active: "Already working on this spec"
     - If in completed: "Spec already completed"
     - If in draft: Proceed with activation

  2. Active Limit:
     - Count: Active specs in .quaestor/specs/active/
     - Limit: Maximum 3 active specs
     - If at limit: "Active limit reached (3 specs). Complete one before starting another."
     - If under limit: Proceed with activation

  3. Specification Validity:
     - Check: Has phases defined
     - Check: Has acceptance criteria
     - If invalid: "Specification incomplete. Please update before starting."
```

### Activation Process

**Move from Draft to Active:**
```yaml
Atomic Operation:
  1. Read Specification:
     Source: .quaestor/specs/draft/spec-feature-001.md
     Parse: Extract metadata and phases

  2. Update Status:
     Field: status
     Change: "draft" ‚Üí "in_progress"
     Add: start_date (current date)

  3. Move File:
     From: .quaestor/specs/draft/spec-feature-001.md
     To: .quaestor/specs/active/spec-feature-001.md
     Method: Git mv (preserves history)

  4. Confirm:
     Display: "‚úÖ Activated: spec-feature-001 - User Authentication"
     Display: "Status: in_progress"
     Display: "Phases: 4 total, 0 completed"
```

## Phase 3: Progress Tracking

### Phase Status Updates

**During Implementation:**
```yaml
Phase Tracking:
  Format in Specification:
    ## Phases

    ### Phase 1: Authentication Flow Design
    - [ ] Task 1
    - [ ] Task 2
    Status: ‚è≥ in_progress

    ### Phase 2: JWT Implementation
    - [ ] Task 1
    - [ ] Task 2
    Status: ‚è≥ pending

  Update Protocol:
    1. Complete tasks: Mark checkboxes [x]
    2. Update status: pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed
    3. Add notes: Implementation details
    4. Track blockers: If any issues

  Example Update:
    ### Phase 1: Authentication Flow Design
    - [x] Design login flow
    - [x] Design registration flow
    - [x] Design password reset flow
    Status: ‚úÖ completed

    Implementation Notes:
    - Used JWT with 15min access, 7day refresh
    - Implemented token rotation for security
    - Added rate limiting on auth endpoints
```

### Acceptance Criteria Tracking

**Track Progress Against Criteria:**
```yaml
Acceptance Criteria Format:
  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - [ ] AC1: Users can register with email/password
  - [ ] AC2: Users can log in and receive JWT
  - [ ] AC3: Tokens expire after 15 minutes
  - [ ] AC4: Refresh tokens work correctly
  - [ ] AC5: Rate limiting prevents brute force

Update During Implementation:
  As Each Criterion Met:
    - Mark checkbox: [x]
    - Add evidence: Link to test or code
    - Validate: Ensure actually working

  Example:
    - [x] AC1: Users can register with email/password
      ‚úì Implemented in auth/registration.py
      ‚úì Tests: test_registration_flow.py (8 tests passing)
```

## Error Handling

### Specification Not Found

```yaml
Issue: No matching specification

Actions:
  1. Search all folders: draft/, active/, completed/
  2. Try fuzzy matching on title
  3. If still no match:
     Output: "‚ùå No matching specification found"
     Output: "Available specifications:"
     Output: [List active and draft specs]
     Output: "Would you like to create a new spec?"

  4. If user wants to create:
     Delegate to spec-writing skill
```

### Active Limit Reached

```yaml
Issue: Already 3 active specs

Actions:
  1. Count active specs
  2. If at limit:
     Output: "‚ùå Active limit reached (3 specs)"
     Output: "Currently active:"
     Output: [List 3 active specs with progress]
     Output: "Complete one before starting another"

  3. Suggest:
     Output: "Would you like to:"
     Output: "1. Continue one of the active specs"
     Output: "2. Move one back to draft"
```

### Invalid Specification

```yaml
Issue: Spec missing required fields

Actions:
  1. Validate specification structure
  2. Check required fields: id, title, phases, criteria
  3. If invalid:
     Output: "‚ùå Specification incomplete"
     Output: "Missing: [list missing fields]"
     Output: "Please update specification before starting"

  4. Suggest fix:
     Output: "Use spec-writing skill to update specification"
```
