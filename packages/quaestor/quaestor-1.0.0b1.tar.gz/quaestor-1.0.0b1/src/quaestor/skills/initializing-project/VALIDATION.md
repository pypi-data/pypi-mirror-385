# User Validation Workflow

This file describes the mandatory user validation process that must occur before project initialization completes.

## Phase 3: User Validation ‚úÖ **[MANDATORY]**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULE:**

```yaml
before_phase_4:
  MUST_PRESENT_ANALYSIS:
    - framework_detection_results
    - architecture_pattern_analysis
    - quality_standards_detected
    - project_phase_determination

  MUST_GET_USER_CHOICE:
    options:
      - "‚úÖ Proceed with detected setup"
      - "üîÑ Modify detected patterns"
      - "üìù Custom architecture description"
      - "üö´ Start with minimal setup"

  VIOLATION_CONSEQUENCES:
    - if_skipped: "IMMEDIATE STOP - Restart from Phase 3"
    - required_response: "I must validate this analysis with you before proceeding"
```

## Validation Template

I **MUST** present this analysis to the user:

```
## Project Analysis Validation ‚úã

**Detected Configuration:**
- Framework: [detected_framework]
- Architecture: [detected_pattern]
- Complexity: [score]/1.0
- Phase: [project_phase]

```

### 3. Files Analyzed

Show what was examined to build confidence:

```yaml
files_display:
  format: "- [file_path]: [what_was_found]"
  examples:
    - "pyproject.toml: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, pytest dependencies"
    - "src/domain/: Clean domain layer detected"

    - "src/lib.rs: Layered module structure"
```

## User Response Handling

### Option 1: ‚úÖ Proceed with detected setup

```yaml
proceed:
  user_says: "Proceed with detected setup" | "Looks good" | "Yes" | "Continue"
  action: "Move to Phase 4 with all detected settings"
  no_changes: true
```

### Option 2: üîÑ Modify detected patterns

```yaml
modify:
  user_says: "Modify detected patterns" | "Change something" | "Adjust"
  follow_up_questions:
    - "What would you like to change?"
    - "Which aspect needs adjustment? (framework/architecture/quality standards)"

  common_modifications:
    - Change complexity threshold
    - Adjust test coverage requirements
    - Modify linting rules
    - Update architecture pattern choice
    - Change project phase classification

  example_dialogue:
    user: "Modify detected patterns"
    me: "What would you like to adjust?"
    user: "Change coverage requirement to 90%"
    me: "Updated coverage threshold to 90%. Anything else?"
    user: "No, proceed"
    me: "[Move to Phase 4 with modifications]"
```

### Option 3: üìù Custom architecture description

```yaml
custom:
  user_says: "Custom architecture" | "I'll describe it" | "Let me explain"
  follow_up: "Please describe your project architecture"

  collect_information:
    - Architecture pattern (if different from detected)
    - Key components and their responsibilities
    - Technology choices and rationale
    - Quality standards and thresholds
    - Testing strategy

  example_dialogue:
    user: "Custom architecture description"
    me: "Please describe your architecture approach"
    user: "We use Clean Architecture with CQRS, event sourcing for writes..."
    me: "Got it. I'll use your custom architecture description. Proceed?"
    user: "Yes"
    me: "[Move to Phase 4 with custom architecture]"
```

### Option 4: üö´ Start with minimal setup

```yaml
minimal:
  user_says: "Minimal setup" | "Keep it simple" | "Basic only"
  action: "Create minimal configuration without detected patterns"

  minimal_setup_includes:
    - Basic AGENT.md (standard workflow rules)
    - Basic ARCHITECTURE.md template (user fills in later)
    - CLAUDE.md entry point
    - Directory structure
    - No language-specific customization
    - No framework detection applied

  example_dialogue:
    user: "Start with minimal setup"
    me: "I'll create a minimal setup without framework-specific customization."
    me: "[Move to Phase 4 with minimal config]"
```

## Enforcement Rules

### ‚ùå NEVER Skip Validation

```yaml
prohibited_actions:
  - Proceeding to Phase 4 without user approval
  - Assuming user wants default configuration
  - Auto-selecting "Proceed" option
  - Skipping validation "to save time"

required_behavior:
  - ALWAYS present full analysis
  - ALWAYS wait for explicit user choice
  - ALWAYS confirm understanding of user's choice
  - ALWAYS document which option was chosen
```

### ‚úÖ Required Confirmation

Before moving to Phase 4, I must have:
1. Presented complete analysis to user
2. Shown all 4 options
3. Received explicit user selection
4. Confirmed understanding of selection

Only then can I proceed to Phase 4.
