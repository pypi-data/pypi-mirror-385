# Review Modes - Different Review Strategies

This file describes the different review modes available and when to use each one.

## Mode Overview

```yaml
Available Modes:
  full: Complete 5-phase review pipeline (default)
  quick: Fast review for small changes
  commit-only: Generate commits without PR
  validate-only: Quality checks and fixes only
  pr-only: Create PR from existing commits
  analysis: Deep code quality analysis
  archive-spec: Move completed spec to completed/

Mode Selection:
  - Auto-detect based on context
  - User specifies with flags
  - Optimize for common workflows
```

---

## Full Review Mode (Default)

### Overview

```yaml
Full Review Mode:
  phases: [Validate, Fix, Commit, Review, Ship]
  time: 15-30 minutes
  coverage: Comprehensive
  output: Complete PR with rich context

When to Use:
  - Completed feature ready to ship
  - Major changes need thorough review
  - Want comprehensive quality validation
  - Need multi-agent review insights
  - Creating important PR

When NOT to Use:
  - Small quick fixes (use quick mode)
  - Just need commits (use commit-only)
  - Already have commits (use pr-only)
  - Just checking quality (use validate-only)
```

### Workflow

```yaml
Phase 1: Comprehensive Validation (üîç)
  - Multi-domain quality checks
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Test coverage analysis
  - Documentation completeness
  - Quality gate enforcement

Phase 2: Intelligent Auto-Fixing (‚ö°)
  - Simple issue direct fixes
  - Complex issue agent delegation
  - Parallel fix execution
  - Validation after fixes

Phase 3: Smart Commit Generation (üìù)
  - Change analysis and grouping
  - Commit classification
  - Conventional commit format
  - Specification integration

Phase 4: Multi-Agent Review (ü§ñ)
  - refactorer: Code quality review
  - security: Security review
  - qa: Test coverage review
  - implementer: Documentation review
  - architect: Architecture review (if needed)
  - Consolidated review summary

Phase 5: PR Creation & Shipping (üöÄ)
  - PR title and description generation
  - Quality metrics inclusion
  - Review insights integration
  - Automation setup
  - Specification archiving
```

### Example Usage

```bash
# Command-based
/review

# Conversation-based

      No ‚Üí Do you need quality check?
        Yes ‚Üí Use: validate-only (check + fix)
        No ‚Üí Continue working

Is this a small change (<5 files)?
  Yes ‚Üí Use: quick (fast review)
  No ‚Üí Use: full (comprehensive review)

Do you need detailed metrics?
  Yes ‚Üí Use: analysis (deep insights)
  No ‚Üí Use: appropriate mode above

  3. Feature complete: full (review and PR)
  4. After merge: archive-spec (archive spec)

Before Refactoring ‚Üí During ‚Üí After:
  1. Before: analysis (understand current state)
  2. During: validate-only (ensure quality)
  3. After: full (review refactoring + PR)

Long Feature ‚Üí Progress ‚Üí Ship:
