# Examples

This library includes several examples demonstrating various filtering techniques.

## Example Code

Example code can be found in the `bayesian_filters/examples/` directory of the repository:

- **RadarUKF.py** - Unscented Kalman Filter tracking example
- **bearing_only.py** - Bearing-only tracking example
- **GetRadar.py** - Radar simulation utilities

## Jupyter Notebooks

For comprehensive examples and tutorials, see the companion book:

**[Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/)**

This free book contains extensive examples using FilterPy and is written as Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to experiment with the code interactively.

## Running Examples

To run the examples:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeorgePearse/bayesian_filters
cd bayesian_filters/bayesian_filters/examples
python RadarUKF.py
```
