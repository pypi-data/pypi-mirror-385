"""High-level turn and step events for agent interactions.

This module defines the semantic event model that wraps the lower-level
responses API stream events. It provides a turn/step conceptual model that
makes agent interactions easier to understand and work with.

Key concepts:
- Turn: A complete interaction loop that may span multiple responses
- Step: A distinct phase within a turn (inference or tool_execution)
- Delta: Incremental updates during step execution
- Result: Complete output when a step finishes
