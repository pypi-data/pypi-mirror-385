# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Optional certificate verification**  
  - Introduced BLS12-381 certificate verification using the official [`blst`](https://github.com/supranational/blst) Python binding.  
  - New parameter `verify_certificate` in `Agent.update_raw`.  
  - When `verify_certificate=True`, update calls are verified against the ICâ€™s certified responses.  
  - Includes full unit test coverage for verification scenarios.  

### Changed
- **Endpoint upgrade**  
  - Migrated `update_raw` calls from legacy `/api/v2/.../call` endpoint to new **BN v3 call endpoint** (`/api/v3/canister/.../call`).  
  - Implemented response adaptation and improved retry logic for more stable request handling.  
  - Enhanced the `poll` and `poll_and_wait` methods for correctness and resilience.  

- **Timeouts & error classification**  
  - Added configurable timeout handling in client calls.  
  - Improved error classification for common canister rejection codes, with more structured runtime exceptions.

### Security
- Addresses longstanding gaps in certificate validation:  
  - `update_raw` and `poll` now support certificate verification when enabled.  
  - Protects against unverified responses from boundary nodes.
