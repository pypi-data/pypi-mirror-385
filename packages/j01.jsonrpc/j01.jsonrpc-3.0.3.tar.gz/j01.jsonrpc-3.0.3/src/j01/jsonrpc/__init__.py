    You can simply implement your own logik for apply the right ids or css
    classes in your pages within this methods. All you have to do is to use
    them in your layout with something like:

        Note: Only use the stateURL url if the full page can get loaded within
        a browser request and make sure that the page provides a layout within
        the browser request. You can also use a totaly different url of  page
        which can get loaded including  layout if the page itself does not
        support a layout.

        Note: the stateURL is also shown in the browser navigation and will get
        use for navigation if the user clicks the browser relaod button e.g.
        ctrl/F5.

        Note; this url is also used if the user booksmarks a page.

        Remember, a jsonrpc request will only call update/render and a browser
        request will call __call__/update/render. Only the __call__ method will
        include the layout template.
