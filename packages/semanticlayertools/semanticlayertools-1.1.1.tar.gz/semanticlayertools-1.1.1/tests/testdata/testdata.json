The thermionic properties of rhenium and rhenium with an adsorbed layer of thorium atoms, were investigated. The Richardson constants for rhenium were found to be \u03c6=4.85 eV, A=66 A per cm^2-deg^2. The work function decreases with increasing thorium coverage \u03c3 to a minimum of 3.15 eV at \u03c3=4.2\u00d710^14 atoms per sq cm then rises to a constant value of 3.3 eV at \u03c3=8\u00d710^14 atoms per sq cm. A comparison with the system tungsten\u2014thorium shows that: (a) \u03c6_min occurs at the same surface density in both cases, (b) \u03c6_const is attained at the same surface density in both cases, and this density is that of the atoms in a (100) plane of thorium metal, and (c) the values of \u03c6_const are equal and different from that of bulk thorium by only 0.1 eV. On the basis of these regularities a model is proposed to explain the variation of \u03c6 with \u03c3. 2. The thermal desorption of the adsorbed atoms was studied at temperatures between 2203\u00b0 and 2468\u00b0K. At low coverage the desorption rate per atom \u03b7_0, was found to be constant with coverage, and to obey the relation \u03b7_0=CT exp (-\u220a\/kT) with C=4\u00d710^10 sec^-1 deg^-1 and \u220a=8.30 eV. The desorption rate increased for coverages between 0.05 and 0.5 monolayer and this increase agreed well with the predictions of a theory based on interactions among the adsorbed atoms.","3":"The Theory of Space, Time and Gravitation","4":"500-Kv-Line Design","5":"In this paper we have considered certain problems which arise when one attempts to cast a covariant field theory into a canonical form. Because of the invariance properties of the theory, certain identities exist between the canonical field variables. To insure that the canonical theory is equivalent to the underlying lagrangian formalism one must require that these identities, once satisfied, will remain satisfied through the course of time. In general, this will be true only if additional constraints are set between the canonical variables. We have shown that only a finite number of such constraints exist and that they form a function group. Our proof rests essentially on the possibility of constructing a generating function for an infinitesimal canonical transformation that is equivalent to an invariant infinitesimal transformation on the lagrangian formalism. Once a hamiltonian is obtained by one of the procedures outlined in previous papers of this series, and the constraints have all been found, the consistent, invariant canonical formulation of the theory is completed. The main results of the paper have been formulated in such a manner as to make them applicable to a fairly general type of invariance. In the last sections we have applied these results to the cases of gauge and coordinate invariance. In the latter case a hamiltonian, corresponding to a quadratic lagrangian, has been constructed in a parameter-free form; and in both cases the constraints, together with the poisson bracket relations between them, have been obtained explicitly. As was to be expected, two constraints were found for a gauge-invariant theory and eight for a coordinate-invariant theory.","6":"Absolute change in general relativity","7":"Quantum Restrictions on the Measurability of Fields in Gravitational Theory","8":"Dyson has shown that the evaluation of the S matrix for quantum electrodynamics can be reduced to the problem of evaluating certain quantities, S^'F, D^'F, and \u0393_\u03bc. By making use of a formula relating the T product of an operator with its corresponding N product, integro-differential equations for S^'F and D^'F are obtained. These equations are identical in form with those given by Schwinger for his Green's functions, and hence it is concluded that the two formalisms are equivalent. In addition it is shown that all of the quantities introduced by Schwinger can be expressed in terms of a single quantity, S_vac, the vacuum expectation value of the S matrix. The renormalization problem is not discussed.","9":"In this paper we analyze the difficulties which occur when one attempts to quantize a theory such as electrodynamics or the general theory of relativity. Because of the invariance properties of theories of this type all of the canonical variables of the theory are not independent of one another but rather there exists certain algebraic relations between them called constraints. These constraints plus the Hamiltonian, in the unquantized version of the theory, constitute a function group. It is proved that there exists at least one ordering of factors in the quantized theory for which this is also true. From this fact we conclude that it is possible, at least formally, to construct a quantum version of the theories under consideration and that the quantum version will possess the same invariance properties as the corresponding unquantized theory."},"pubIDs":{"0":"10.1016\/0022-3697(60)90159-1","1":"10.1088\/0031-9155\/8\/3\/305","2":"10.1063\/1.1702725","3":"10.1063\/1.3051237","4":"10.1109\/TPAS.1963.291452","5":"10.1103\/PhysRev.83.1018","6":"Absolute change in general relativity","7":"Quantum Restrictions on the Measurability of Fields in Gravitational Theory","8":"10.1103\/PhysRev.94.703","9":"10.1103\/PhysRev.99.1009"}}
