    Fullreader class to handle the full OCR process for a given image.
    NOTE: As for now the program only works with grayscale images.
       
    Attributes:
        readerEasyOcr (easyocr.Reader): EasyOCR reader instance for text recognition. 
            Used to read player and team names from cropped images of players.
            
        modelScore (keras.Model): Custom Keras model for recognizing scores.
            Used to recognize scores from cropped images of players.
        
        modelPosition (keras.Model): Custom Keras model for recognizing positions.
            Used to recognize positions from cropped images of players. 
            (NOTE: This model is currently NULL because esayocr worked just fine)
        
        modelTablePath (str): Path to the custom YOLO model for table detection.
            Used to recognize the table area in the image, and the number of players in that table if there is one
        
        modelPlayersPath (str): Path to the custom YOLO model for player detection.
            Used to recognize player areas in the image, such as their positions, tags, names, and scores.
