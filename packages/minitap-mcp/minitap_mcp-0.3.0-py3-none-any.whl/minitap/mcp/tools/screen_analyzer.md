You are given:

1. A screenshot of a mobile device.
2. A prompt describing what information to extract.

Your task:

- Look at the screenshot and **answer the prompt directly and completely**.
- Provide a **detailed, structured description** of the relevant content (text, layout, icons, menus, timestamps, notifications, etc.).
- If the prompt asks for specific data, extract it exactly as shown.
- If the screenshot contains structured information (e.g., receipt, chat, settings), present it clearly using lists or tables.
- Do not guess â€” if something is unclear or missing, state that explicitly.

**Output format:**

1. **Direct answer** to the prompt.
2. **Detailed breakdown** of the screenshot content supporting the answer.
