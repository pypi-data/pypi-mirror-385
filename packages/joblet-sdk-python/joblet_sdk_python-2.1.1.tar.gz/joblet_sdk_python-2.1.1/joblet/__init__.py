Joblet Python SDK

A comprehensive Python SDK for interacting with the Joblet job orchestration system.
This SDK provides a high-level, Pythonic interface to all Joblet functionality including
job execution, workflow management, runtime environments, networking, storage, and
system monitoring.

Key Features:
    - Simple job execution with resource constraints
    - Complex multi-job workflow orchestration
    - Runtime environment management and installation
    - Virtual network and persistent volume management
    - Real-time system monitoring and metrics streaming
    - Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
    - Full type hints for better development experience

Quick Start:
    >>> from joblet import JobletClient
    >>>
    >>> # Connect to local Joblet server
    >>> with JobletClient() as client:
    ...     # Check server health
    ...     if client.health_check():
    ...         # Run a simple job
    ...         job = client.jobs.run_job(
    ...             command="echo",
    ...             args=["Hello, Joblet!"],
    ...             name="greeting-job"
    ...         )
    ...         print(f"Job started: {job['job_uuid']}")
    ...
    ...         # Monitor job status
    ...         status = client.jobs.get_job_status(job['job_uuid'])
    ...         print(f"Status: {status['status']}")
