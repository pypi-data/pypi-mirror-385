"""Ray Tune stopper for iteration-based early stopping with result tracking.

This module provides :class:`MaximumResultIterationStopper`, an enhanced version
of Ray Tune's MaximumIterationStopper that uses result-based iteration counting
instead of internal restore-based counting.

Key Components:
    - :class:`MaximumResultIterationStopper`: Result-based iteration stopper
    - Integration with Ray RLlib metrics and logging
    - Enhanced stopping criteria with environment step tracking

The stopper provides more accurate iteration counting for distributed training
scenarios where internal iteration counters may not reflect actual training progress.

    """Stop trials after reaching a maximum number of training iterations.

    This stopper differs from Ray Tune's standard MaximumIterationStopper by using
    the training iteration count from results rather than an internal counter that
    tracks iterations since restore. This provides more accurate stopping behavior
    for distributed training scenarios.

    The stopper examines `result[TRAINING_ITERATION]` to determine when to stop trials,
    which reflects the actual training progress rather than restore-relative progress.
    It also provides enhanced logging with environment step information.

    Args:
        max_iter: Maximum number of training iterations before stopping a trial.

    Example:
        >>> stopper = MaximumResultIterationStopper(max_iter=1000)
        >>> # Use with Ray Tune
        >>> tune.run(trainable, stop=stopper)

    Note:
        When a trial is stopped, the stopper logs the trial ID, current iteration,
        maximum iteration limit, and total environment steps sampled for debugging
        and monitoring purposes.
