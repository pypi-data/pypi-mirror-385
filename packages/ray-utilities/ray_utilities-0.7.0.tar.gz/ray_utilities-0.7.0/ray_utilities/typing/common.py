"""Common base types for unified type hierarchy across Ray Utilities.

This module provides base types that unify common structures between
algorithm return data and metrics logging types, eliminating redundancy
while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

The base types defined here are inherited by both:
- `ray_utilities.typing.algorithm_return`: Types for raw algorithm results
- `ray_utilities.typing.metrics`: Types for processed logging metrics

Base Types:
    :class:`BaseEnvRunnersResultsDict`: Core environment runner metrics
    :class:`BaseEvaluationResultsDict`: Core evaluation structure
