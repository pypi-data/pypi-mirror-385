# Tessell MCP Server

**Tessell MCP Server** is your AI-powered command center for cloud data and services. It connects your favorite IDEs (like **VS Code**, **Cursor**) or chat-based clients (like **Claude**) to Tessell-—so you can manage everything using **natural language**.

With simple prompts, you can:

- Manage services, snapshots, and availability machines  
- Explore and operate databases (Oracle, PostgreSQL, and more)—on Tessell or anywhere else  
- Run queries, check health, and troubleshoot—without switching tools or writing scripts

Just describe what you want to do—**Tessell MCP Server takes care of the rest**.

## Why Use Tessell MCP Server?

- **Conversational Power**: Manage your cloud and databases using plain language—no scripts or CLI required  
- **Unified Control**: Access both Tessell-native and external databases from one place  
- **Instant Insights**: Query, analyze, and troubleshoot in seconds  
- **Secure & Local**: Your credentials stay safe—nothing leaves your environment unless you approve it  

## Installation & Configuration

### Requirements
- Tessell account with an active API key  
- Tenant API base URL and Tenant ID  
- Compatible MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor)

### Configuration
To set up the Tessell MCP Server, add the following configuration to your MCP client's configuration file (such as `mcp_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tessell": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "tessell-mcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "TESSELL_API_BASE": "{your-tenant-api-url}",
        "TESSELL_API_KEY": "{your-api-key}",
        "TESSELL_TENANT_ID": "{your-tenant-id}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Database Connections

Connect to your database by setting an environment variable with your connection string. The variable name must start with `CONNSTR_` (e.g., `CONNSTR_HR_DB`).

**Example:**
```json
"env": {
  "CONNSTR_ANALYTICS_DB": "postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database",
  "CONNSTR_HR_DB": "oracle://user:password@host:1521/service"
}
```

Tessell MCP supports PostgreSQL and Oracle, with MySQL and SQL Server coming soon. Use the standard URI format for your database engine.

Be sure to replace the placeholders with your actual database information and keep your credentials secure.
