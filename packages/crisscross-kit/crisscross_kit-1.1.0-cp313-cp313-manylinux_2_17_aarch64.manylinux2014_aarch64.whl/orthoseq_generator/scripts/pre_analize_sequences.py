Purpose:
    Generate an initial pool of DNA sequence pairs, compute their on-target and off-target
    Gibbs free energies, and plot the distributions. This helps you choose sensible energy
    cutoff thresholds for downstream selection algorithms.

    NOTE: After running this once to get the overall energy distributions, use
    `analyze_on_target_range.py` (the second script) for a focused look at a specific
    on-target energy window based on your initial histograms.

Main Steps:
    1. Set a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
    2. Generate all 8-mer sequence pairs (and their reverse complements), filtering out any
       with four identical bases in a row.
    3. Point to (and enable) a precomputed energy cache to speed up repeated runs.
    4. Randomly sample up to 250 sequence pairs from the pool.
    5. Compute on-target energies (pair-hybridization) and off-target energies (cross-hybridization).
    6. Plot and save the histograms of both distributions to 'energy_hist.pdf', printing summary stats.
