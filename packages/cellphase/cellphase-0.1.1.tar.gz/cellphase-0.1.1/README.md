The notebook has 4 cells:

1. pip install all the dependencies
2. Run to explore different outputs with different combinations of parameters a. diameter b. flow_threshold. From this cell output you will get an idea which parameter combination works well.
3. Use the diameter and flow_threshold you like (you will get an idea from the 2nd cell) in the 3rd cell to save the *predicted masks* at "test_pred" folder (automatically created, do not worry !)
4. Use the diameter and flow_threshold you like (you will get an idea from the 2nd cell) in the 3rd cell to save the *predicted rois* at "test_roi" folder (automatically created, do not worry !)

Important: Make sure you read the instructions at each cell before running it.
