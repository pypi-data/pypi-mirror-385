  CdsPhaseType:
    description: For features of type CDS (coding sequence), the phase indicates where the feature begins with reference to
      the reading frame. The phase is one of the integers 0, 1, or 2, indicating the number of bases that should be removed
      from the beginning of this feature to reach the first base of the next codon.
