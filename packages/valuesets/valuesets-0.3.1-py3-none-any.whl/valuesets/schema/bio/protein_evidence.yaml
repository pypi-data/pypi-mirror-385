  protein_evidence_for_existence:
    description: The evidence for the existence of a biological entity
    range: ProteinEvidenceForExistence
  ref_seq_status:
    description: RefSeq status codes, taken from https://www
    range: RefSeqStatusType
enums:
  ProteinEvidenceForExistence:
    description: The evidence for the existence of a biological entity. See https://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_existence
      and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/evidence/.
    permissible_values:
      EXPERIMENTAL_EVIDENCE_AT_PROTEIN_LEVEL:
        description: Indicates that there is clear experimental evidence for the existence of the protein. The criteria include
          partial or complete Edman sequencing, clear identification by mass spectrometry, X-ray or NMR structure, good quality
          protein-protein interaction or detection of the protein by antibodies.
      EXPERIMENTAL_EVIDENCE_AT_TRANSCRIPT_LEVEL:
        description: Indicates that the existence of a protein has not been strictly proven but that expression data (such
          as existence of cDNA(s), RT-PCR or Northern blots) indicate the existence of a transcript.
      PROTEIN_INFERRED_BY_HOMOLOGY:
        description: Indicates that the existence of a protein is probable because clear orthologs exist in closely related
          species.
      PROTEIN_PREDICTED:
        description: Used for entries without evidence at protein, transcript, or homology levels.
      PROTEIN_UNCERTAIN:
        description: Indicates that the existence of the protein is unsure.
  RefSeqStatusType:
    description: RefSeq status codes, taken from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/evidence/.
    permissible_values:
      MODEL:
        description: The RefSeq record is provided by the NCBI Genome Annotation pipeline and is not subject to individual
          review or revision between annotation runs.
      INFERRED:
        description: The RefSeq record has been predicted by genome sequence analysis, but it is not yet supported by experimental
          evidence. The record may be partially supported by homology data.
      PREDICTED:
        description: The RefSeq record has not yet been subject to individual review, and some aspect of the RefSeq record
          is predicted.
      PROVISIONAL:
        description: The RefSeq record has not yet been subject to individual review. The initial sequence-to-gene association
          has been established by outside collaborators or NCBI staff.
      REVIEWED:
        description: The RefSeq record has been reviewed by NCBI staff or by a collaborator. The NCBI review process includes
          assessing available sequence data and the literature. Some RefSeq records may incorporate expanded sequence and
          annotation information.
      VALIDATED:
        description: The RefSeq record has undergone an initial review to provide the preferred sequence standard. The record
          has not yet been subject to final review at which time additional functional information may be provided.
      WGS:
        description: The RefSeq record is provided to represent a collection of whole genome shotgun sequences. These records
          are not subject to individual review or revisions between genome updates.
