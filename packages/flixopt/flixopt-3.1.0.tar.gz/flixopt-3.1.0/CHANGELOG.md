## [3.1.0] - 2025-10-19

**Summary**: This release adds faceting and animation support for multidimensional plots and redesigns the documentation website. Plotting results across scenarios or periods is now significantly simpler (Plotly only).

If upgrading from v2.x, see the [Migration Guide](https://flixopt.github.io/flixopt/latest/user-guide/migration-guide-v3/) and [v3.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixOpt/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

### ✨ Added
- **Faceting and animation for multidimensional plots**: All plotting methods now support `facet_by` and `animate_by` parameters to create subplot grids and animations from multidimensional data (scenarios, periods, etc.). *Plotly only.*
- **Flexible data selection with `select` parameter**: Select data using single values, lists, slices, or index arrays for precise control over what gets plotted
- **Heatmap fill control**: New `fill` parameter in heatmap methods controls how missing values are filled after reshaping (`'ffill'` or `'bfill'`)
- **Smart line styling for mixed variables**: Area plots now automatically style variables containing both positive and negative values with dashed lines, while stacking purely positive or negative variables

### ♻️ Changed
- **Breaking: Selection behavior**: Plotting methods no longer automatically select the first value for non-time dimensions. Use the `select` parameter for explicit selection of scenarios, periods, or other dimensions
- **Better error messages**: Enhanced error messages when using Matplotlib with multidimensional data, with clearer guidance on dimension requirements and suggestions to use Plotly
- **Improved examples**: Enhanced `scenario_example.py` with better demonstration of new features
- **Robust validation**: Improved dimension validation in `plot_heatmap()` with clearer error messages

### 🗑️ Deprecated
- **`indexer` parameter**: Use the new `select` parameter instead. The `indexer` parameter will be removed in v4.0.0
- **`heatmap_timeframes` and `heatmap_timesteps_per_frame` parameters**: Use the new `reshape_time=(timeframes, timesteps_per_frame)` parameter instead in heatmap plotting methods
- **`color_map` parameter**: Use the new `colors` parameter instead in heatmap plotting methods

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed cryptic errors when working with empty buses by adding proper validation
- Added early validation for non-existent periods when using linked periods with tuples

### 📝 Documentation
- **Redesigned documentation website** with custom css

### 👷 Development
- Renamed internal `_apply_indexer_to_data()` to `_apply_selection_to_data()` for consistency with new API naming

---

## [3.0.3] - 2025-10-16

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-13
**Summary**: This release introduces new model dimensions (periods and scenarios) for multi-period investments and stochastic modeling, along with a redesigned effect sharing system and enhanced I/O capabilities.

**Note**: If upgrading from v2.x, see the [Migration Guide](https://flixopt.github.io/flixopt/latest/user-guide/migration-guide-v3/) and [v3.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixOpt/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

### ✨ Added

**New model dimensions:**

- **Period dimension**: Enables multi-period investment modeling with distinct decisions in each period for transformation pathway optimization
- **Scenario dimension**: Supports stochastic modeling with weighted scenarios for robust decision-making under uncertainty (demand, prices, weather)
    - Control variable independence across scenarios via `scenario_independent_sizes` and `scenario_independent_flow_rates` parameters
    - By default, investment sizes are shared across scenarios while flow rates vary per scenario

**Redesigned effect sharing system:**

Effects now use intuitive `share_from_*` syntax that clearly shows contribution sources:

```python
costs = fx.Effect('costs', '€', 'Total costs',
    share_from_temporal={'CO2': 0.2},      # From temporal effects
    share_from_periodic={'land': 100})     # From periodic effects
```

This replaces `specific_share_to_other_effects_*` parameters and inverts the direction for clearer relationships.

**Enhanced I/O and data handling:**

- NetCDF/JSON serialization for all Interface objects and FlowSystem with round-trip support
- FlowSystem manipulation: `sel()`, `isel()`, `resample()`, `copy()`, `__eq__()` methods
- Direct access to FlowSystem from results without manual restoring (lazily loaded)
- New `FlowResults` class and precomputed DataArrays for sizes/flow_rates/flow_hours
- `effects_per_component` dataset for component impact evaluation, including all indirect effects through effect shares

**Other additions:**

- Balanced storage - charging and discharging sizes can be forced equal via `balanced` parameter
- New Storage parameters: `relative_minimum_final_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_final_charge_state` for final state control
- Improved filter methods in results
- Example for 2-stage investment decisions leveraging FlowSystem resampling

### 💥 Breaking Changes

**API and Behavior Changes:**

- **Effect system redesigned** (no deprecation):
  - **Terminology changes**: Effect domains renamed for clarity: `operation` → `temporal`, `invest`/`investment` → `periodic`
  - **Sharing system**: The old `specific_share_to_other_effects_*` parameters were completely replaced with the new `share_from_temporal` and `share_from_periodic` syntax (see 🔥 Removed section)
- **FlowSystem independence**: FlowSystems cannot be shared across multiple Calculations anymore. A copy of the FlowSystem is created instead, making every Calculation independent. Each Subcalculation in `SegmentedCalculation` now has its own distinct `FlowSystem` object
- **Bus and Effect object assignment**: Direct assignment of Bus/Effect objects is no longer supported. Use labels (strings) instead:
  - `Flow.bus` must receive a string label, not a Bus object
  - Effect shares must use effect labels (strings) in dictionaries, not Effect objects
- **Logging defaults** (from v2.2.0): Console and file logging are now disabled by default. Enable explicitly with `CONFIG.Logging.console = True` and `CONFIG.apply()`

**Class and Method Renaming:**

- Renamed class `SystemModel` to `FlowSystemModel`
- Renamed class `Model` to `Submodel`
- Renamed `mode` parameter in plotting methods to `style`
- `Calculation.do_modeling()` now returns the `Calculation` object instead of its `linopy.Model`. Callers that previously accessed the linopy model directly should now use `calculation.do_modeling().model` instead of `calculation.do_modeling()`

**Variable Renaming in Results:**

- Investment binary variable: `is_invested` → `invested` in `InvestmentModel`
- Switch tracking variables in `OnOffModel`:
  - `switch_on` → `switch|on`
  - `switch_off` → `switch|off`
  - `switch_on_nr` → `switch|count`
- Effect submodel variables (following terminology changes):
  - `Effect(invest)|total` → `Effect(periodic)`
  - `Effect(operation)|total` → `Effect(temporal)`
  - `Effect(operation)|total_per_timestep` → `Effect(temporal)|per_timestep`
  - `Effect|total` → `Effect`

**Data Structure Changes:**

- `relative_minimum_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_charge_state` don't have an extra timestep anymore. Use the new `relative_minimum_final_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_final_charge_state` parameters for final state control

### ♻️ Changed

- Type system overhaul - added clear separation between temporal and non-temporal data throughout codebase for better clarity
- Enhanced FlowSystem interface with improved `__repr__()` and `__str__()` methods
- Improved Model Structure - Views and organisation is now divided into:
    - Model: The main Model (linopy.Model) that is used to create and store the variables and constraints for the FlowSystem.
    - Submodel: The base class for all submodels. Each is a subset of the Model, for simpler access and clearer code.
- Made docstrings in `config.py` more compact and easier to read
- Improved format handling in configuration module
- Enhanced console output to support both `stdout` and `stderr` stream selection
- Added `show_logger_name` parameter to `CONFIG.Logging` for displaying logger names in messages

### 🗑️ Deprecated

- The `agg_group` and `agg_weight` parameters of `TimeSeriesData` are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use `aggregation_group` and `aggregation_weight` instead.
- The `active_timesteps` parameter of `Calculation` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the new `sel(time=...)` method on the FlowSystem instead.
- **InvestParameters** parameters renamed for improved clarity around investment and retirement effects:
    - `fix_effects` → `effects_of_investment`
    - `specific_effects` → `effects_of_investment_per_size`
    - `divest_effects` → `effects_of_retirement`
    - `piecewise_effects` → `piecewise_effects_of_investment`
- **Effect** parameters renamed:
    - `minimum_investment` → `minimum_periodic`
    - `maximum_investment` → `maximum_periodic`
    - `minimum_operation` → `minimum_temporal`
    - `maximum_operation` → `maximum_temporal`
    - `minimum_operation_per_hour` → `minimum_per_hour`
    - `maximum_operation_per_hour` → `maximum_per_hour`
- **Component** parameters renamed:
    - `Source.source` → `Source.outputs`
    - `Sink.sink` → `Sink.inputs`
    - `SourceAndSink.source` → `SourceAndSink.outputs`
    - `SourceAndSink.sink` → `SourceAndSink.inputs`
    - `SourceAndSink.prevent_simultaneous_sink_and_source` → `SourceAndSink.prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates`

### 🔥 Removed

- **Effect share parameters**: The old `specific_share_to_other_effects_*` parameters were replaced WITHOUT DEPRECATION
    - `specific_share_to_other_effects_operation` → `share_from_temporal` (with inverted direction)
    - `specific_share_to_other_effects_invest` → `share_from_periodic` (with inverted direction)

### 🐛 Fixed

- Enhanced NetCDF I/O with proper attribute preservation for DataArrays
- Improved error handling and validation in serialization processes
- Better type consistency across all framework components
- Added extra validation in `config.py` to improve error handling

### 📝 Docs

- Reorganized mathematical notation docs: moved to lowercase `mathematical-notation/` with subdirectories (`elements/`, `features/`, `modeling-patterns/`)
- Added comprehensive documentation pages: `dimensions.md` (time/period/scenario), `effects-penalty-objective.md`, modeling patterns
- Enhanced all element pages with implementation details, cross-references, and "See Also" sections
- Rewrote README and landing page with clearer vision, roadmap, and universal applicability emphasis
- Removed deprecated `docs/SUMMARY.md`, updated `mkdocs.yml` for new structure
- Tightened docstrings in core modules with better cross-referencing
- Added recipes section to docs

### 🚧 Known Issues

- IO for single Interfaces/Elements to Datasets might not work properly if the Interface/Element is not part of a fully transformed and connected FlowSystem. This arises from Numeric Data not being stored as xr.DataArray by the user. To avoid this, always use the `to_dataset()` on Elements inside a FlowSystem that's connected and transformed.

### 👷 Development

- **Centralized deprecation pattern**: Added `_handle_deprecated_kwarg()` helper method to `Interface` base class that provides reusable deprecation handling with consistent warnings, conflict detection, and optional value transformation. Applied across 5 classes (InvestParameters, Source, Sink, SourceAndSink, Effect) reducing deprecation boilerplate by 72%.
- FlowSystem data management simplified - removed `time_series_collection` pattern in favor of direct timestep properties
- Change modeling hierarchy to allow for more flexibility in future development. This leads to minimal changes in the access and creation of Submodels and their variables.
- Added new module `.modeling` that contains modeling primitives and utilities
- Clearer separation between the main Model and "Submodels"
- Improved access to the Submodels and their variables, constraints and submodels
- Added `__repr__()` for Submodels to easily inspect its content
- Enhanced data handling methods
    - `fit_to_model_coords()` method for data alignment
    - `fit_effects_to_model_coords()` method for effect data processing
    - `connect_and_transform()` method replacing several operations
- **Testing improvements**: Eliminated warnings during test execution
    - Updated deprecated code patterns in tests and examples (e.g., `sink`/`source` → `inputs`/`outputs`, `'H'` → `'h'` frequency)
    - Refactored plotting logic to handle test environments explicitly with non-interactive backends
    - Added comprehensive warning filters in `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml` to suppress third-party library warnings
    - Improved test fixtures with proper figure cleanup to prevent memory leaks
    - Enhanced backend detection and handling in `plotting.py` for both Matplotlib and Plotly
    - Always run dependent tests in order

  - *Note: This is still experimental and might change in the future*

### ♻️ Changed
- **Multi-Flow Support**: `Sink`, `Source`, and `SourceAndSink` now accept multiple `flows` as `inputs` and `outputs` instead of just one. This enables modeling more use cases with these classes
- **Flow Control**: Both `Sink` and `Source` now have a `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates` argument to prevent simultaneous flow rates of more than one of their flows

### 🗑️ Deprecated
- For the classes `Sink`, `Source` and `SourceAndSink`: `.sink`, `.source` and `.prevent_simultaneous_sink_and_source` are deprecated in favor of the new arguments `inputs`, `outputs` and `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates`
