    """Define a single linear segment with specified domain boundaries.

    This class represents one linear segment that will be combined with other
    pieces to form complete piecewise linear functions. Each piece defines
    a domain interval [start, end] where a linear relationship applies.

    Args:
        start: Lower bound of the domain interval for this linear segment.
            Can be scalar values or time series arrays for time-varying boundaries.
        end: Upper bound of the domain interval for this linear segment.
            Can be scalar values or time series arrays for time-varying boundaries.

    Examples:
        Basic piece for equipment efficiency curve:

        ```python
        # Single segment from 40% to 80% load
        efficiency_segment = Piece(start=40, end=80)
        ```

        Piece with time-varying boundaries:

        ```python
        # Capacity limits that change seasonally
        seasonal_piece = Piece(
            start=np.array([10, 20, 30, 25]),  # Minimum capacity by season

        )
        ```

        Fixed operating point (start equals end):

        ```python
        # Equipment that operates at exactly 50 MW
        fixed_output = Piece(start=50, end=50)

    """
    Define a Piecewise, consisting of a list of Pieces.

    Args:
        pieces: list of Piece objects defining the linear segments. The arrangement
            and relationships between pieces determine the function behavior:
            - Touching pieces (end of one = start of next) ensure continuity
            - Gaps between pieces create forbidden regions
            - Overlapping pieces provide an extra choice for the optimizer

    Piece Relationship Patterns:
        **Touching Pieces (Continuous Function)**:
        Pieces that share boundary points create smooth, continuous functions
        without gaps or overlaps.

        **Gaps Between Pieces (Forbidden Regions)**:
        Non-contiguous pieces with gaps represent forbidden regions.
        For example minimum load requirements or safety zones.

        **Overlapping Pieces (Flexible Operation)**:
        Pieces with overlapping domains provide optimization flexibility,
        allowing the solver to choose which segment to operate in.

    Examples:
        Continuous efficiency curve (touching pieces):

        ```python
        efficiency_curve = Piecewise(
            [
                Piece(start=0, end=25),  # Low load: 0-25 MW
                Piece(start=25, end=75),  # Medium load: 25-75 MW (touches at 25)
                Piece(start=75, end=100),  # High load: 75-100 MW (touches at 75)
            ]
        )
        ```

        Equipment with forbidden operating range (gap):

        ```python
        turbine_operation = Piecewise(
            [
                Piece(start=0, end=0),  # Off state (point operation)
                Piece(start=40, end=100),  # Operating range (gap: 0-40 forbidden)
            ]
        )
        ```

        Flexible operation with overlapping options:

        ```python
        flexible_operation = Piecewise(
            [
                Piece(start=20, end=60),  # Standard efficiency mode
                Piece(start=50, end=90),  # High efficiency mode (overlap: 50-60)
            ]
        )
        ```

        Tiered pricing structure:

        ```python
        electricity_pricing = Piecewise(
            [
                Piece(start=0, end=100),  # Tier 1: 0-100 kWh
                Piece(start=100, end=500),  # Tier 2: 100-500 kWh
                Piece(start=500, end=1000),  # Tier 3: 500-1000 kWh
            ]
        )
        ```

        Seasonal capacity variation:

        ```python
        seasonal_capacity = Piecewise(
            [
                Piece(start=[10, 15, 20, 12], end=[80, 90, 85, 75]),  # Varies by time
            ]
        )
        ```

    Container Operations:
        The Piecewise class supports standard Python container operations:

        ```python
        piecewise = Piecewise([piece1, piece2, piece3])

        len(piecewise)  # Returns number of pieces (3)
        piecewise[0]  # Access first piece
        for piece in piecewise:  # Iterate over all pieces
            print(piece.start, piece.end)
        ```

    Validation Considerations:
        - Pieces are typically ordered by their start values
        - Check for unintended gaps that might create infeasible regions
        - Consider whether overlaps provide desired flexibility or create ambiguity
        - Ensure time-varying pieces have consistent dimensions

    Common Use Cases:
        - Power plants: Heat rate curves, efficiency vs load, emissions profiles
        - HVAC systems: COP vs temperature, capacity vs conditions
        - Industrial processes: Conversion rates vs throughput, quality vs speed
        - Financial modeling: Tiered rates, progressive taxes, bulk discounts
        - Transportation: Fuel efficiency curves, capacity vs speed
        - Storage systems: Efficiency vs state of charge, power vs energy
        - Renewable energy: Output vs weather conditions, curtailment strategies

class PiecewiseConversion(Interface):
    """Define coordinated piecewise linear relationships between multiple flows.

    This class models conversion processes where multiple flows (inputs, outputs,
    auxiliaries) have synchronized piecewise relationships. All flows change
    together based on the same operating point, enabling accurate modeling of
    complex equipment with variable performance characteristics.

    Multi-Flow Coordination:
        All piecewise functions must have matching piece structures (same number
        of pieces with compatible domains) to ensure synchronized operation.
        When the equipment operates at a given point, ALL flows scale proportionally
        within their respective pieces.

    Mathematical Formulation:
        See the complete mathematical model in the documentation:
        [Piecewise](../user-guide/mathematical-notation/features/Piecewise.md)

    Args:
        piecewises: Dictionary mapping flow labels to their Piecewise functions.
            Keys are flow identifiers (e.g., 'electricity_in', 'heat_out', 'fuel_consumed').
            Values are Piecewise objects that define each flow's behavior.
            **Critical Requirement**: All Piecewise objects must have the same
            number of pieces with compatible domains to ensure consistent operation.

    Operating Point Coordination:
        When equipment operates at any point within a piece, all flows scale
        proportionally within their corresponding pieces. This ensures realistic
        equipment behavior where efficiency, consumption, and production rates
        all change together.

        ```

    Design Patterns:
        **Forbidden Ranges**: Use gaps between pieces to model equipment that cannot
        operate in certain ranges (e.g., minimum loads, unstable regions).

        **Discrete Modes**: Use pieces with identical start/end values to model
        equipment with fixed operating points (e.g., on/off, discrete speeds).

        **Efficiency Changes**: Coordinate input and output pieces to reflect
        changing conversion efficiency across operating ranges.

    Common Use Cases:
        - Power generation: Multi-fuel plants, cogeneration systems, renewable hybrids
        - HVAC systems: Heat pumps, chillers with variable COP and auxiliary loads
        - Industrial processes: Multi-product reactors, separation units, heat exchangers
        - Transportation: Multi-modal systems, hybrid vehicles, charging infrastructure
        - Water treatment: Multi-stage processes with varying energy and chemical needs
        - Energy storage: Systems with efficiency changes and auxiliary power requirements

    This class models situations where a decision variable (the origin) generates

    PiecewiseConversion which coordinates multiple flows, PiecewiseEffects focuses
    on how one variable impacts multiple system-wide effects.

            Keys are effect identifiers (e.g., 'cost_per_unit', 'CO2_intensity').
            Values are Piecewise objects defining the contribution rate per unit
            of the origin variable at different operating levels.

    Mathematical Relationship:
        For each effect: Total_Effect = Origin_Variable × Share_Rate(Origin_Level)

        This enables modeling of:
        - Economies of scale (decreasing unit costs with volume)
        - Learning curves (improving efficiency with experience)
        - Threshold effects (changing rates at different scales)
        - Progressive pricing (increasing rates with consumption)

class InvestParameters(Interface):
    """Define investment decision parameters with flexible sizing and effect modeling.

    This class models investment decisions in optimization problems, supporting
    both binary (invest/don't invest) and continuous sizing choices with
    comprehensive cost structures. It enables realistic representation of
    investment economics including fixed costs, scale effects, and divestment penalties.

    Investment Decision Types:
        **Binary Investments**: Fixed size investments creating yes/no decisions
        (e.g., install a specific generator, build a particular facility)

        **Continuous Sizing**: Variable size investments with minimum/maximum bounds
        (e.g., battery capacity from 10-1000 kWh, pipeline diameter optimization)

    Cost Modeling Approaches:
        - **Fixed Effects**: One-time costs independent of size (permits, connections)
        - **Specific Effects**: Linear costs proportional to size (€/kW, €/m²)
        - **Piecewise Effects**: Non-linear relationships (bulk discounts, learning curves)
        - **Divestment Effects**: Penalties for not investing (demolition, opportunity costs)

    Mathematical Formulation:
        See the complete mathematical model in the documentation:
        [InvestParameters](../user-guide/mathematical-notation/features/InvestParameters.md)

    Args:
        fixed_size: Creates binary decision at this exact size. None allows continuous sizing.
        minimum_size: Lower bound for continuous sizing. Default: CONFIG.Modeling.epsilon.
            Ignored if fixed_size is specified.
        maximum_size: Upper bound for continuous sizing. Default: CONFIG.Modeling.big.
            Ignored if fixed_size is specified.
        mandatory: Controls whether investment is required. When True, forces investment
            to occur (useful for mandatory upgrades or replacement decisions).
            When False (default), optimization can choose not to invest.
            With multiple periods, at least one period has to have an investment.
        effects_of_investment: Fixed costs if investment is made, regardless of size.
            Dict: {'effect_name': value} (e.g., {'cost': 10000}).
        effects_of_investment_per_size: Variable costs proportional to size (per-unit costs).
            Dict: {'effect_name': value/unit} (e.g., {'cost': 1200}).
        piecewise_effects_of_investment: Non-linear costs using PiecewiseEffects.
            Combinable with effects_of_investment and effects_of_investment_per_size.
        effects_of_retirement: Costs incurred if NOT investing (demolition, penalties).
            Dict: {'effect_name': value}.

    Deprecated Args:
        fix_effects: **Deprecated**. Use `effects_of_investment` instead.
            Will be removed in version 4.0.
        specific_effects: **Deprecated**. Use `effects_of_investment_per_size` instead.
            Will be removed in version 4.0.
        divest_effects: **Deprecated**. Use `effects_of_retirement` instead.
            Will be removed in version 4.0.

            Will be removed in version 4.0.
        optional: DEPRECATED. Use `mandatory` instead. Opposite of `mandatory`.
            Will be removed in version 4.0.
        linked_periods: Describes which periods are linked. 1 means linked, 0 means size=0. None means no linked periods.

    Cost Annualization Requirements:
        All cost values must be properly weighted to match the optimization model's time horizon.
        For long-term investments, the cost values should be annualized to the corresponding operation time (annuity).

        - Use equivalent annual cost (capital cost / equipment lifetime)
        - Apply appropriate discount rates for present value calculations
        - Account for inflation, escalation, and financing costs

        Example: €1M equipment with 20-year life → €50k/year fixed cost

    Examples:
        Simple binary investment (solar panels):

        ```python
        solar_investment = InvestParameters(
            fixed_size=100,  # 100 kW system (binary decision)

class OnOffParameters(Interface):
    """Define operational constraints and effects for binary on/off equipment behavior.

    This class models equipment that operates in discrete states (on/off) rather than
    continuous operation, capturing realistic operational constraints and associated
    costs. It handles complex equipment behavior including startup costs, minimum
    run times, cycling limitations, and maintenance scheduling requirements.

    Key Modeling Capabilities:
        **Switching Costs**: One-time costs for starting equipment (fuel, wear, labor)
        **Runtime Constraints**: Minimum and maximum continuous operation periods
        **Cycling Limits**: Maximum number of starts to prevent excessive wear
        **Operating Hours**: Total runtime limits and requirements over time horizon

    Typical Equipment Applications:
        - **Power Plants**: Combined cycle units, steam turbines with startup costs
        - **Industrial Processes**: Batch reactors, furnaces with thermal cycling
        - **HVAC Systems**: Chillers, boilers with minimum run times
        - **Backup Equipment**: Emergency generators, standby systems
        - **Process Equipment**: Compressors, pumps with operational constraints

    Mathematical Formulation:
        See the complete mathematical model in the documentation:
        [OnOffParameters](../user-guide/mathematical-notation/features/OnOffParameters.md)

    Args:
        effects_per_switch_on: Costs or impacts incurred for each transition from
            off state (var_on=0) to on state (var_on=1). Represents startup costs,
            wear and tear, or other switching impacts. Dictionary mapping effect
            names to values (e.g., {'cost': 500, 'maintenance_hours': 2}).
        effects_per_running_hour: Ongoing costs or impacts while equipment operates
            in the on state. Includes fuel costs, labor, consumables, or emissions.
            Dictionary mapping effect names to hourly values (e.g., {'fuel_cost': 45}).
        on_hours_total_min: Minimum total operating hours across the entire time horizon.
            Ensures equipment meets minimum utilization requirements or contractual
            obligations (e.g., power purchase agreements, maintenance schedules).
        on_hours_total_max: Maximum total operating hours across the entire time horizon.
            Limits equipment usage due to maintenance schedules, fuel availability,
            environmental permits, or equipment lifetime constraints.
        consecutive_on_hours_min: Minimum continuous operating duration once started.
            Models minimum run times due to thermal constraints, process stability,
            or efficiency considerations. Can be time-varying to reflect different
            constraints across the planning horizon.
        consecutive_on_hours_max: Maximum continuous operating duration in one campaign.
            Models mandatory maintenance intervals, process batch sizes, or
            equipment thermal limits requiring periodic shutdowns.
        consecutive_off_hours_min: Minimum continuous shutdown duration between operations.
            Models cooling periods, maintenance requirements, or process constraints
            that prevent immediate restart after shutdown.
        consecutive_off_hours_max: Maximum continuous shutdown duration before mandatory
            restart. Models equipment preservation, process stability, or contractual
            requirements for minimum activity levels.
        switch_on_total_max: Maximum number of startup operations across the time horizon.
            Limits equipment cycling to reduce wear, maintenance costs, or comply
            with operational constraints (e.g., grid stability requirements).
        force_switch_on: When True, creates switch-on variables even without explicit
            switch_on_total_max constraint. Useful for tracking or reporting startup
            events without enforcing limits.

    Note:
        **Time Series Boundary Handling**: The final time period constraints for
        consecutive_on_hours_min/max and consecutive_off_hours_min/max are not
        enforced, allowing the optimization to end with ongoing campaigns that
        may be shorter than the specified minimums or longer than maximums.
