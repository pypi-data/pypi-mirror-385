You know when you have to write code that you vaguely remember having written somewhere before? It's annoying to have to look into dozens of files to find a function, I have gone through it, that's why I made this contraption.

Sanguine is a CLI tool that automatically indexes definitions from your code repositories and lets you search for them later. It integrates seamlessly with Git to automatically index code changes on every commit, making it easy to search and navigate your codebase.

## Features

- 🚀 **Automatic Indexing**: Integrates with Git post-commit hooks to automatically index code changes
- 🔍 **Smart Search**: Find functions and classes using natural language queries
- 🌐 **Cross-Repository Search**: Search across all your indexed codebases at once, or narrow to specific repositories
- 📊 **Multi-Language Support**: Works with Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, Go, Rust, and more
- 🎨 **Interactive Mode**: Provides an interactive search interface for exploratory code navigation
- 🔧 **Flexible Filtering**: Search by name, path, or entity type (function/class)
- ⚡ **Fast Performance**: Quick search results even in large codebases

## Installation

Install Sanguine using pip:

```bash
pip install sanguine
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n1teshy/sanguine.git
cd sanguine
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Git Hook

Navigate to your Git repository and install the post-commit hook:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
sanguine install
```

This will automatically index your code after every commit.

### 2. Index Existing Code

Index all files in your current repository:

```bash
sanguine index --all-files
```

Or index a specific file:

```bash
sanguine index --file path/to/file.py
```

### 3. Search Your Codebase

Simple search:

```bash
sanguine search "user authentication"
```

Interactive search mode, use this when multiple search calls are needed:

```bash
sanguine search --interactive
```

## Usage

### Commands

#### `install`
Install the post-commit Git hook for automatic indexing.

```bash
sanguine install
```

#### `uninstall`
Remove the post-commit Git hook.

```bash
sanguine uninstall
```

#### `index`
Index code from commits, files, or entire repository.

**Index last commit** (default):
```bash
sanguine index
```

**Index specific commit**:
```bash
sanguine index --commit-id abc123
```

**Index specific file**:
```bash
sanguine index --file src/main.py
```

**Index all files** (respects .gitignore):
```bash
sanguine index --all-files
```

#### `search`
Search indexed code entities (functions and classes).

**Basic search**:
```bash
sanguine search "query"
```

**Search with options**:
```bash
# Limit results
sanguine search "database" --count 20

# Filter by path
sanguine search "handler" --path src/api

# Filter by type (function or class)
sanguine search "user" --type function

# Combine filters
sanguine search "model" --path src/models --type class --count 15
```

**Interactive mode**:
```bash
sanguine search --interactive
# In the REPL:
>> query --count 10
>> another query --path src
>> :q  # to quit
```

#### `delete`
Delete indexed entities based on filters.

**Delete by name**:
```bash
sanguine delete --name "test_"
```

**Delete by path**:
```bash
sanguine delete --path src/deprecated
```

**Delete with type filter**:
```bash
sanguine delete --name "old" --type function
```

**Force delete without confirmation**:
```bash
sanguine delete --name "temp" --yes
```

#### `refresh`
Refresh the HNSW vector index. Use this when you see warnings about stale entries.

```bash
sanguine refresh
```

## How It Works

Sanguine automatically indexes your code as you work:

1. **Automatic Indexing**: After installing the Git hook, Sanguine indexes changes every time you commit
2. **Manual Indexing**: You can also manually index specific files, commits, or your entire codebase
3. **Smart Search**: Search uses both text matching and semantic understanding to find relevant functions and classes
4. **Fast Results**: Results are ranked by relevance and returned instantly

### Supported Languages

Sanguine supports multiple programming languages:

- Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Java
- C / C++
- Go
- Rust
- Ruby
- PHP
- And more...

## Data Storage

Sanguine stores its index data in platform-specific directories:

- **Linux/Mac**: `~/.local/share/sanguine/`
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sanguine\`

**Important**: All indexed code from all repositories is stored in a single database. This means you can search across all your projects at once! Use the `--path` flag to narrow searches to a specific repository when needed.

The index is stored locally on your machine and is separate for each user. No data is sent to external servers.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Index Maintenance

Sanguine will warn you if the index needs refreshing. When you see warnings about stale entries (>30% stale), run:

```bash
sanguine refresh
```

This rebuilds the index and improves search quality.

### Large Repositories

For large codebases:
- Initial indexing with `--all-files` may take a few minutes
- After that, automatic indexing on commits is fast
- Use path filters (`--path`) to narrow search scope when searching
- Use type filters (`--type`) to search only functions or only classes

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Initial setup in a new project
cd my-project
sanguine install
sanguine index --all-files

# Set up other projects too
cd ../another-project
sanguine install
sanguine index --all-files

# Daily usage - automatic indexing on commits
git commit -m "Add new feature"
# Sanguine automatically indexes changes

# Search across ALL your indexed projects
sanguine search "authentication" --type function

# Search within a specific project only
sanguine search "authentication" --path /path/to/my-project

# Interactive exploration across all projects
sanguine search -i
>> user management
>> login handler --path my-project
>> :q

# Clean up old code references
sanguine delete --path old-code --yes

# Maintain index health
sanguine refresh
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git (for automatic indexing features)

## Troubleshooting

### "Not a git repository" error
Make sure you're in a Git repository directory when running `sanguine install` or `sanguine index` (without flags).

### Search returns no results
- Make sure you've indexed your code first with `sanguine index --all-files`
- Check if the files you're looking for are in a supported language
- Try broader search terms

### Hook not working after commit
- Verify the hook is installed: `ls .git/hooks/post-commit`
- Try reinstalling: `sanguine uninstall` then `sanguine install`
- Make sure Python is accessible from your Git environment
