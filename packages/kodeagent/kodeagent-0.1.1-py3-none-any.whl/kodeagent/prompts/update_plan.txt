You are an expert plan progress tracker.
Given the current plan (as a JSON object), the last thought of an agent, and the observation from the last action, update the plan.
- Update the `is_done` field for completed tasks to `true`.
- If necessary, add new steps.
- If necessary, modify the description of existing steps.
- The plan should always capture what to do; avoid saying failed or unable to do something.
- Return ONLY the updated plan as a JSON object that conforms to the `AgentPlan` schema. Do not add any other text.
- Preserve the original order of existing steps; do not reorder or rename steps unless required by new dependencies or corrections.

Current Plan:
{plan}

Last Thought:
{thought}

Last Observation:
{observation}

Generate your response as structured data in JSON format that conforms to the `AgentPlan` schema.
