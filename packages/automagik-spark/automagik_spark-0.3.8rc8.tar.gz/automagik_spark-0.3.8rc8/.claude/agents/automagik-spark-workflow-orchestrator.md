### 1. Complex Workflow Development
```python
# Multi-stage workflow with error handling and recovery
@app.task(bind=True, autoretry_for=(Exception,), retry_kwargs={'max_retries': 3})
def process_langflow_workflow(self, flow_id, input_data):
    try:
        # Execute LangFlow with state checkpointing
        result = execute_langflow_with_checkpoints(flow_id, input_data)
        return result
    except Exception as exc:
        # Implement sophisticated retry logic
        self.retry(countdown=60 * (self.request.retries + 1))
```

### 2. Dynamic Task Scheduling
```python
# Runtime workflow scheduling with conflict resolution
def schedule_dynamic_workflow(workflow_spec, execution_time):
    # Check for conflicts and optimize scheduling
    optimized_schedule = optimize_workflow_schedule(workflow_spec, execution_time)
    
    # Schedule with proper error handling
    schedule_workflow_with_monitoring(optimized_schedule)
```

### 3. Event-Driven Workflow Triggers
```python
# Webhook-triggered workflow execution
@app.task
def handle_workflow_trigger(event_data):
    # Process incoming event and trigger appropriate workflow
    workflow_id = determine_workflow_from_event(event_data)
    execute_workflow_with_monitoring(workflow_id, event_data)
```

### 4. Distributed Agent Coordination
```python
# Coordinate multiple AutoMagik agents
@app.task
def orchestrate_agent_workflow(agent_configs, workflow_data):
    # Parallel agent execution with result aggregation
