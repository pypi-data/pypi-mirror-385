## üí° Best Practices & Patterns

### **Async SQLAlchemy Patterns**
```python
# Proper session lifecycle management
async with get_session() as session:
    # Transaction scope with proper rollback handling
    try:
        result = await session.execute(stmt)
        await session.commit()
        return result
    except Exception:
        await session.rollback()
        raise

# Efficient relationship loading
stmt = select(Workflow).options(
    selectinload(Workflow.tasks),
    selectinload(Workflow.components)
)
```

### **Repository Pattern Implementation**
```python
class WorkflowRepository:
    def __init__(self, session: AsyncSession):
        self.session = session
    
    async def get_by_id(self, workflow_id: UUID) -> Optional[Workflow]:
        stmt = select(Workflow).where(Workflow.id == workflow_id)
        result = await self.session.execute(stmt)
        return result.scalar_one_or_none()
    
    async def get_active_workflows(self) -> List[Workflow]:
        stmt = select(Workflow).where(Workflow.status == "active")
        result = await self.session.execute(stmt)
        return result.scalars().all()
```

### **Migration Best Practices**
```python
# Always include rollback logic
def upgrade():
    # Schema changes with proper indexing
    op.create_table(
        'new_table',
        sa.Column('id', sa.UUID, primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('created_at', sa.DateTime, default=sa.func.now()),
        sa.Index('idx_created_at', 'created_at')
    )

def downgrade():
    # Safe rollback procedure
    op.drop_table('new_table')
```

### **Performance Optimization Patterns**
```python
# Efficient bulk operations
async def bulk_create_tasks(session: AsyncSession, tasks: List[TaskData]):
    task_objects = [Task(**task_data.dict()) for task_data in tasks]
    session.add_all(task_objects)
    await session.commit()

# Query optimization with proper indexing
stmt = select(Task).where(
    and_(
        Task.workflow_id.in_(workflow_ids),
        Task.status == "completed",
        Task.created_at >= start_date
    )
).order_by(Task.created_at.desc())
```
