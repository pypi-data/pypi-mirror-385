## 🚀 What is Automagik Spark?

**Automagik Spark** is the automation engine that gives your AI agents a sense of time. While LangFlow and Hive create powerful workflows and agents, Spark makes them **proactive**—running tasks on schedules, triggering actions automatically, and working 24/7 without manual intervention.

Think of Spark as the alarm clock, calendar, and scheduler for your entire AI infrastructure.

### 💡 The Problem We Solve

**The Challenge**: Your AI workflows are brilliant but passive. They sit idle until you remember to trigger them:
- Daily reports that you forget to generate
- Monitoring tasks that need constant attention
- Routine automations that require manual kicks
- Agents that only respond when asked

**Our Solution**: Spark transforms passive workflows into active systems that work autonomously on your schedule.

### ✅ How Spark Changes the Game

**Before Spark**:
- ❌ Manually trigger workflows every time
- ❌ Set reminders to run routine tasks
- ❌ AI that only reacts when prompted
- ❌ Miss opportunities because agents weren't watching

**After Spark**:
- ✅ Workflows run automatically on schedule
- ✅ Set it once, runs forever
- ✅ AI that takes initiative proactively
- ✅ Never miss a beat with 24/7 automation

    API <-->|Store State| DB
    CLI -->|Commands| API
    MCP -->|Control| API
    REST -->|HTTP| API
```

### The Spark Lifecycle

1. **Connect**: Link your LangFlow/Hive instances
2. **Sync**: Discover all available workflows and agents
3. **Schedule**: Define when and how often tasks should run
4. **Execute**: Workers trigger workflows automatically
5. **Monitor**: Track execution history and results
6. **Scale**: Add more workers as your automation grows

### Example: Daily Report Automation

```bash
# 1. Add your LangFlow instance
automagik-spark source add http://langflow:7860 YOUR_API_KEY

# 2. Sync available flows
automagik-spark workflow sync "daily-sales-report"

# 3. Schedule it to run every weekday at 8 AM
automagik-spark schedule create WORKFLOW_ID "0 8 * * 1-5"

# That's it! Your report generates automatically every morning
```

## 🎮 Using Spark

### Via CLI (Recommended for Developers)

```bash
# Add a workflow source
automagik-spark source add https://my-langflow.com API_KEY_HERE

# List all available workflows
automagik-spark workflow list

# Sync a specific workflow
automagik-spark workflow sync "email-processor"

# Create a schedule (runs daily at midnight)
automagik-spark schedule create WORKFLOW_ID "0 0 * * *"

# List all schedules
automagik-spark schedule list

# View task execution history
automagik-spark task list
```

### Via REST API (For Integrations)

```bash
# Add a source
curl -X POST http://localhost:8883/api/v1/sources \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://langflow.example.com", "api_key": "..."}'

# Create a schedule
curl -X POST http://localhost:8883/api/v1/schedules \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workflow_id": "...", "cron": "0 0 * * *"}'
```

### Via MCP (From AI Coding Agents)

Spark is available as an MCP tool in [Automagik Tools](https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-tools):

```bash
# Install MCP server
uvx automagik-tools hub

# Now use natural language from Claude Code, Cursor, etc:
# "Schedule my daily-report workflow to run every morning at 9am"
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:15432/spark

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8883

# Telemetry (optional)
AUTOMAGIK_SPARK_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=false
```

### Cron Expression Examples

```bash
"*/5 * * * *"      # Every 5 minutes
"0 * * * *"        # Every hour
"0 0 * * *"        # Daily at midnight
"0 9 * * 1-5"      # Weekdays at 9 AM
"0 0 * * 0"        # Every Sunday at midnight
"0 0 1 * *"        # First day of every month
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Telemetry

### Built-in Monitoring

```bash
# View recent task executions
automagik-spark task list --limit 20

# Check worker status
automagik-spark worker status

# View system health
curl http://localhost:8883/api/v1/health
```

### Privacy-Focused Telemetry

Spark collects anonymous usage metrics to improve the product:

**What we collect**:
- Command usage frequency
- API endpoint usage patterns
- Workflow execution statistics
- Error rates (no error details)

**What we DON'T collect**:
- Personal information
- Workflow content or data
- API keys or credentials
- File paths or environment variables

**Disable telemetry anytime**:
```bash
# Environment variable
export AUTOMAGIK_SPARK_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true

# CLI command
automagik-spark telemetry disable

# Opt-out file
touch ~/.automagik-no-telemetry
```
