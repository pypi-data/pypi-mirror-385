FynX MergedObservable - Combined Reactive Values
================================================

This module provides the MergedObservable class, which combines multiple individual
observables into a single reactive computed observable. This enables treating related
observables as a cohesive group that updates atomically when any component changes.

Merged observables are read-only computed observables that derive their value from
their source observables. They are useful for:

- **Coordinated Updates**: When multiple values need to change together
- **Computed Relationships**: When derived values depend on multiple inputs
- **Tuple Operations**: When you need to pass multiple reactive values as a unit
- **State Composition**: Building complex state from simpler reactive components

The merge operation is created using the `+` operator between observables:

```python
from fynx import observable

width = observable(10)
height = observable(20)
dimensions = width + height  # Creates MergedObservable
print(dimensions.value)  # (10, 20)

width.set(15)
print(dimensions.value)  # (15, 20)

# Merged observables are read-only
dimensions.set((5, 5))  # Raises ValueError: Computed observables are read-only
```

    """
    A computed observable that combines multiple observables into a single reactive tuple.

    MergedObservable creates a read-only computed observable whose value is a tuple containing
    the current values of all source observables. When any source observable changes,
    the merged observable automatically recalculates its tuple value and notifies all subscribers.

    As a computed observable, MergedObservable is read-only and cannot be set directly.
    Its value is always derived from its source observables, ensuring consistency.

    This enables treating multiple related reactive values as a single atomic unit,
    which is particularly useful for:

    - Functions that need multiple related parameters
    - Computed values that depend on several inputs
    - Coordinated state updates across multiple variables
    - Maintaining referential consistency between related values

    Example:
        ```python
        from fynx import observable

        # Individual observables
        x = observable(10)
        y = observable(20)

        # Merge them into a single reactive unit
        point = x + y
        print(point.value)  # (10, 20)

        # Computed values can work with the tuple
        distance_from_origin = point.then(
            lambda px, py: (px**2 + py**2)**0.5
        )
        print(distance_from_origin.value)  # 22.360679774997898

        # Changes to either coordinate update everything
        x.set(15)
        print(point.value)                  # (15, 20)
        print(distance_from_origin.value)   # 25.0
        ```

    Note:
        The merged observable's value is always a tuple, even when merging just
        two observables. This provides a consistent interface for computed functions.
