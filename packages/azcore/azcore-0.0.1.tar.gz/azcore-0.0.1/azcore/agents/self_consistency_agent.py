"""
Self-Consistency Agent Pattern for Azcore.

This module implements the SelfConsistencyAgent, a specialized agent pattern that leverages the
self-consistency technique to improve reasoning reliability and accuracy. The agent generates
multiple independent responses to a given task and aggregates them into a single, consistent
final answer using majority voting and sophisticated aggregation techniques.

The self-consistency approach is based on the research paper:
"Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models"
by Wang et al. (2022) - https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07870

Key Features:
- Concurrent generation of multiple independent responses
- Majority voting aggregation with detailed analysis
- Evaluation mode for answer validation
- Configurable output formats
- Thread-safe execution
- Integration with Azcore.'s ReactAgent

# System prompt for the reasoning agent that generates individual responses
CONSISTENCY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a reasoning agent designed for complex problem-solving and decision-making. Your objective is to provide clear and reliable responses through structured reasoning. Begin by thoroughly understanding the problem, rephrasing it for clarity, and identifying key components. Develop a logical plan that breaks the problem into manageable steps, detailing your approach and any assumptions made. Validate your information with reliable sources and assess the accuracy of your calculations. Explore multiple solutions, weighing their pros and cons, and maintain transparency by documenting your reasoning process, uncertainties, and biases. Summarize your findings in a concise final answer that reflects your thorough analysis, ensuring it is well-organized and accessible. Adapt your reasoning to the context of the problem, integrating new information as needed, and implement error-handling strategies to address any issues that arise. Finally, reflect on your reasoning process to identify areas for improvement and ensure consistency across all reasoning paths.
"""

# Detailed prompt for the majority voting aggregation agent
MAJORITY_VOTING_PROMPT = """
Engage in a comprehensive and exhaustive majority voting analysis of the following conversation, ensuring a deep and thoughtful examination of the responses provided by each agent. This analysis should not only summarize the responses but also critically engage with the content, context, and implications of each agent's input.

Please adhere to the following detailed guidelines:

1. **Identification of Dominant Responses:**
   - Identify the most prevalent answer or recommendation across all agents. Provide a thorough rationale for its dominance, including an exploration of the factors that may have contributed to its acceptance among the agents. Discuss the context in which this consensus emerged and any relevant historical or theoretical frameworks that support this conclusion.

2. **Exploration of Disparities:**
   - Delve into any significant disparities or contrasting viewpoints between agents. Explore the underlying reasons for these differences, considering aspects such as differing methodologies, assumptions, or interpretations of the task at hand. Analyze how these contrasting perspectives may reflect broader debates within the field and what implications they hold for the overall understanding of the topic.

3. **Consensus and Disagreement Analysis:**
   - Highlight key areas of consensus and disagreement among the agents. Discuss the implications of these findings on the overall argument, including how consensus can strengthen certain claims while disagreement may indicate areas of uncertainty or contention. Provide examples from the conversation to illustrate these points and consider how they might influence future discussions or research directions.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Majority Opinion:**
   - Critically evaluate the strength of the majority opinion, considering factors such as the reasoning behind it and its mathematical validity if applicable. Assess whether the majority opinion is well-supported by evidence and logical reasoning, and discuss any potential weaknesses or oversights that may undermine its credibility. 

5. **Insights from Minority Viewpoints:**
   - Note any unique insights from minority viewpoints, assessing their potential contributions to a more nuanced understanding of the topic. Discuss how these minority perspectives can enrich the conversation and provide alternative angles that may have been overlooked by the majority. Consider the value of dissent in academic discourse and how it can lead to more robust conclusions.

6. **Synthesis of Recommendations:**
   - Provide a final synthesized recommendation based on the majority consensus, ensuring that it reflects a thorough consideration of all perspectives and is grounded in sound reasoning. This recommendation should not only summarize the majority view but also integrate insights from minority opinions, creating a comprehensive and balanced conclusion that acknowledges the complexity of the discussion.

Throughout your analysis, focus on uncovering clear patterns while being attentive to the subtleties and complexities inherent in the responses. Pay particular attention to the nuances of mathematical contexts where algorithmic thinking may be required, ensuring that your examination is both rigorous and accessible to a diverse audience.
