## What Makes Arbitrium Framework Different?

Unlike general-purpose agent frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph) designed for task automation and workflow orchestration, **Arbitrium Framework solves a specific problem: synthesizing a single, defensible, high-quality solution from competing AI perspectives.**

The framework uses a **competitive tournament structure** where AI agents:
1. Generate independent solutions to complex problems
2. Critique and learn from each other's approaches
3. Compete in evaluation rounds where weaker solutions are eliminated
4. **Preserve valuable insights from eliminated agents** via the Knowledge Bank
5. Progressively refine until a champion solution emerges

### The Knowledge Bank: Learning from Every Perspective

**This is Arbitrium Framework's core innovation.** When an agent is eliminated, the system:

- Extracts unique insights and valuable reasoning from its solution
- Vectorizes and deduplicates these insights using cosine similarity
- Injects preserved knowledge into surviving agents' context
- Tracks provenance: which ideas came from which eliminated agent

**Result:** The final solution combines the strongest overall approach with the best minority insights from across all competing perspectives. No valuable idea is lost.

## When Should You Use Arbitrium Framework?

### Ideal Use Cases

**Arbitrium Framework is purpose-built for decisions where quality and synthesis matter most:**

- **Strategic Business Decisions**: Market entry analysis, investment theses, strategic planning where diverse perspectives improve outcomes
- **Multi-Stakeholder Synthesis**: Policy development, complex project planning where diverse viewpoints must be integrated
- **Compliance & Legal Analysis**: Scenarios requiring defensible audit trails and traceable reasoning
- **Risk-Sensitive Problem Solving**: Decisions where wrong answers have significant financial, operational, or reputational consequences
- **Research & Academic Analysis**: Complex problems requiring synthesis of competing theoretical frameworks

### Decision Stakes Framework

Consider using Arbitrium Framework when your decision meets these criteria:

| Stakes Level | Characteristics | Tournament Value |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| **Low Stakes** | Simple questions, quick answers needed, single perspective sufficient | Single model more efficient |
| **Medium Stakes** | Important but straightforward, time-sensitive, clear evaluation criteria | Single model with careful prompting |
| **High Stakes** | Complex analysis, multiple valid approaches, significant consequences | **Tournament recommended** - competitive refinement adds substantial value |
| **Critical Stakes** | Highest importance, requires audit trail, long-term impact | **Tournament + human review** - comprehensive validation essential |

**You decide what matters.** The value of tournament-driven synthesis depends on your specific context, risk tolerance, and the cost of being wrong.

## What Makes Tournament-Based Synthesis Unique?

**Arbitrium Framework** takes a different approach to multi-agent AI:

### Competitive-Collaborative Architecture

Instead of conversation or workflow delegation, Arbitrium Framework uses **tournament elimination with knowledge preservation**:

- **Competition** drives quality through elimination of weaker solutions
- **Collaboration** ensures valuable insights from eliminated agents aren't lost
- **Progressive refinement** builds the final answer from the collective intelligence of all participants

### When Tournament Architecture Shines

This approach is particularly effective when:

- **Multiple valid approaches exist** - Tournament discovers which works best for your specific problem
- **Synthesis is critical** - The Knowledge Bank ensures the best ideas from all perspectives are combined
- **Audit trail matters** - Complete provenance tracking shows how each insight contributed to the final solution
- **Quality trumps speed** - Iterative competitive refinement takes time but produces thoroughly vetted results

### Complementary Tools

Arbitrium Framework works alongside other multi-agent frameworks:
- Use **AutoGen** or **LangGraph** for task automation and complex workflows
- Use **CrewAI** for role-based team simulations
- Use **Arbitrium Framework** when you need competitive synthesis and want the best answer to a complex question

## Core Architecture: How It Works

Arbitrium Framework orchestrates a multi-phase tournament where competitive pressure drives quality while collaborative knowledge sharing prevents waste.

### Tournament Phases

**Phase 1: Initial Answers**
- All models independently answer the question
- No collaboration yet—pure diverse perspectives

**Phase 2: Improvement**
- Models exchange responses and improve their answers based on feedback
- Customizable prompts control improvement behavior
- Knowledge Bank insights (if enabled) are injected here

**Elimination Rounds** (repeat until one champion remains)
- Judge model or peer review scores all responses
- Identifies leader (highest score) and weakest model
- Weakest model is eliminated
- Leader extracts unique insights from eliminated model's response
- Insights are vectorized, deduplicated, and stored in Knowledge Bank

**Result:** Champion's final answer combines the strongest approach with preserved insights from all eliminated perspectives.

## Key Features

### 1. No Insights Are Wasted
Unlike simple elimination systems, Arbitrium Framework's Knowledge Bank ensures that even "losing" agents contribute valuable perspectives to the final solution.

### 2. Complete Traceability
Every tournament generates provenance reports showing:
- Which model proposed each idea
- How ideas were critiqued and refined over rounds
- Why certain approaches were eliminated
- What insights were preserved from eliminated models

### 3. Configurable Tournament Dynamics
- **Improvement prompts**: customize how models critique, praise, or build on each other's responses
- **Evaluation methods**: single judge, peer review, or custom judge models
- **Knowledge Bank configuration**: choose which model extracts insights, set similarity thresholds for deduplication

### 4. Quality Monitoring
Built-in tools detect:
- **Consensus convergence**: when responses become too similar (potential groupthink)
- **Diversity metrics**: ensure the tournament maintains varied perspectives
- **Evaluation bias**: monitor judge consistency across rounds

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arbitrium-framework/arbitrium.git
    cd arbitrium
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment** (virtual environment recommended):

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -e .
    ```

    For development (includes testing and linting tools):

    ```sh
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

4.  **Configure the application:**

    **Option A: Free local models (no API keys)**
    - Use `config.public.yml` as-is (requires Ollama)
    - No additional configuration needed

    **Option B: Cloud models (requires API keys)**
    - Copy the example configuration file:
      ```sh
      cp config.example.yml config.yml
      ```
    - Open `config.yml` and configure your models. For most models, only `model_name` and `provider` are required:
      ```yaml
      models:
        gpt:
          provider: openai
          model_name: gpt-4-turbo
          # max_tokens and context_window auto-detected from LiteLLM!
      ```
    - **Auto-detection**: Arbitrium Framework automatically detects `max_tokens` and `context_window` from LiteLLM's database for supported models.
    - Add your API keys as environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or configure 1Password paths in the secrets section.

## Configuration

### Auto-Detection of Model Parameters

Arbitrium Framework automatically detects `max_tokens` and `context_window` from LiteLLM's model database, making configuration easier:

**Minimal configuration (auto-detection):**

```yaml
models:
  gpt:
    provider: openai
    model_name: gpt-4-turbo
    # max_tokens: auto-detected (4096)
    # context_window: auto-detected (128000)
```

**Full configuration (manual override):**

```yaml
models:
  gpt:
    provider: openai
    model_name: gpt-4-turbo
    max_tokens: 8192 # Override default
    context_window: 200000 # Override default
    temperature: 0.9 # Optional, defaults to 0.7
```

**Required fields:**

- `model_name`: The model identifier (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`)
- `provider`: The provider name (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `vertex_ai`)

**Optional fields:**

- `max_tokens`: Maximum output tokens (auto-detected if omitted)
- `context_window`: Maximum input tokens (auto-detected if omitted)
- `temperature`: Sampling temperature (defaults to 0.7)
- `display_name`: Human-readable name (defaults to `model_name`)
- `reasoning_effort`: Extended thinking mode - `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"high"` (supported by GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 4)

**Advanced features:**

```yaml
models:
  gpt:
    provider: openai
    model_name: gpt-5
    reasoning_effort: "high" # Enable extended thinking for complex problems
```

**Note:** For models not in LiteLLM's database (e.g., Grok), you must specify `max_tokens` and `context_window` manually.

## FAQ

### When does tournament synthesis provide the most value?

Single models work excellently for many tasks. Tournament synthesis adds the most value when:

- **Multiple perspectives** surface blind spots and alternative approaches
- **Structured critique** improves quality through competitive refinement
- **Progressive iteration** allows each round to build on previous insights
- **Knowledge preservation** ensures no valuable insight from any perspective is lost
- **Provenance tracking** provides an audit trail showing how ideas evolved and were validated

The tournament approach is designed for complex, high-stakes decisions where the investment in thoroughness is worthwhile.

### How does tournament synthesis differ from multi-agent debate?

Tournament synthesis uses a unique competitive-collaborative model:

- **Competitive pressure** through elimination ensures only the strongest approaches survive
- **Knowledge preservation** ensures valuable insights from all perspectives are retained
- **Progressive refinement** builds each round on collective wisdom rather than individual dialogue

This creates a different dynamic than continuous debate—agents must produce their best work knowing weaker solutions will be eliminated, while the Knowledge Bank ensures their contributions aren't lost.

### What about rate limits?

Arbitrium Framework defaults to **2 parallel API calls** to work with free-tier API plans. This conservative default ensures compatibility with:

- **Anthropic**: Free tier (50 RPM)
- **OpenAI**: Free tier (60 RPM)
- **Google Vertex AI**: Default quotas

For faster execution with higher-tier API plans, increase `max_concurrent_requests` in your configuration. Local models (Ollama) have no rate limits.

### How do I know models aren't just agreeing with each other?

Arbitrium Framework includes multiple safeguards:

- **Consensus monitoring** using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- **Diversity metrics** that flag when responses become too similar
- **Multiple evaluation strategies** (peer review, external judge, multiple judges)
- **Independent initial responses** before any collaboration begins

### Can I use this for research?

Absolutely! Arbitrium Framework is designed for both production use and research. The framework provides:

- **Configurable tournament structures** for studying competitive-collaborative dynamics
- **Detailed logging** of all tournament phases
- **Monitoring utilities** for detecting bias and measuring consensus
- **Reproducible experiments** with deterministic mode
- **Provenance tracking** for analyzing how ideas evolve

We welcome research collaborations and contributions.
