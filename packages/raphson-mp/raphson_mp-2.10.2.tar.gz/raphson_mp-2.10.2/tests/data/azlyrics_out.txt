It may feel bad
It may feel bad
It may feel bad

I wanna see you alone, I wanna sharp the stone
I wanna bounce the bone, I wanna mess with it
I wanna lay the deville, the whole crew on the sill
I want the preacher and pill, I wanna bless with it
I wanna head to a mass and get cast in it
That shit's funnier than any A-class, in' it?
I wanna talk with the clown who has apologies down
Pay him 300 pound to take a class in it
I wanna bite the phone, I wanna bleed the tone
I wanna see you alone, alone, alone, 'lone
I wanna strait the shark and find me somewhere to park
Like the light when it's dark, it's dark, it's dark, dark
A few stars about make it feel like peace in a way
A complimentary round
Constellation got a twist in it
For a GPO and all the hits in it

I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness
I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness
I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness
I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentaryâ€”

I wanna talk with a gag if it's a bottle or bag
I wanna strike with the SAG, I need the friends fro it
I wanna shot the dark, I wanna make the mark
I want to live the arc, I call the ends on it
I wanna take the truth without a lens on it
My God given insanity, it depends on it
How I feel?
How I feel?
How I feel?
I wanna keel
Over harder than a turned up challenger
I wanna keep all your charm in a canister
Do you inspire like the same did Salinger?
I'm the pig on the Chinese calendar
I got a shadow like a .58 Caliber
I wanna move like a new Salamander
I love the carrion who's a real Scavenger
It's moral tyranny keeping it from me

Hit me for the day
For the light
That you suffered
To come by
Take to my sky
Never wanting
Only wonder
To live out of reach
Sloping family
Short to tall
One to three
Swallow the key
In their footprints
I will follow

I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness
I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness
I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness
I'm gon' hit your business if it's momentary blissness
