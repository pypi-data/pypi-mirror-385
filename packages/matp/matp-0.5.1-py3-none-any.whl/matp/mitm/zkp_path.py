        Challenges the peer to prove its network path is direct.

        In a real implementation, this would involve:
        1. Generating a unique, time-sensitive challenge based on the master secret.
        2. Sending the challenge to the peer over the secure connection.
        3. The peer would generate a ZK-SNARK proving its path latency and
           topology match the expected "Path DNA" without revealing specifics.
