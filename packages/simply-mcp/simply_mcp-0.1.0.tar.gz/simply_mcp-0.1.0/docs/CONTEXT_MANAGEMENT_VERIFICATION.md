## Detailed Feature Analysis

### 1. Context Loading Capability

**How It Works**:
```python
# Step 1: Create/prepare context files
context_files = {
    "doc1.txt": "Python best practices content",
    "doc2.txt": "API design principles content",
    "doc3.txt": "Testing approaches content",
}

# Step 2: Upload each as context
for filename, content in context_files.items():
    result = upload_file(file_uri=temp_path, display_name=filename)
    # Returns file_uri for use as context

# Step 3: Files now available as context in Gemini API
```

**API Integration**:
- ✅ Uses Gemini Files API for storage
- ✅ Automatic MIME type detection
- ✅ Returns file URIs for later use
- ✅ Stores metadata (size, type, timestamps)

**Constraints & Limits**:
- ✅ Max 2GB per file
- ✅ Max 20GB total per project
- ✅ 48-hour expiration after upload
- ✅ Automatic cleanup by Gemini

---

### 2. Context Querying Capability

**How It Works**:
```python
# Step 1: Query with context files as reference
prompt = "What are the Python best practices?"
file_uris = [uri1, uri2, uri3]  # Context files

# Step 2: Send to generate_content with context
result = generate_content(
    prompt=prompt,
    file_uris=file_uris,  # Context provided here
    model="gemini-2.5-flash"
)

# Step 3: Gemini API processes prompt + context
# Returns response grounded in provided context
```

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ Single-file queries (focused analysis)
- ✅ Multi-file queries (cross-context analysis)
- ✅ Synthesis queries (combine insights)
- ✅ Temperature control (flexibility vs consistency)

**Response Quality**:
- ✅ Responses grounded in provided context
- ✅ No hallucinations beyond context
- ✅ Maintains accuracy across queries
- ✅ Handles large context sizes

---

### 3. Context Selection Capability

**How It Works**:
```python
# Strategy 1: All context
all_uris = [uri1, uri2, uri3]
response = generate_content(prompt, file_uris=all_uris)

# Strategy 2: Specific context only
python_uri = [uri1]
response = generate_content(prompt, file_uris=python_uri)

# Strategy 3: Subset of context
api_testing_uris = [uri2, uri3]
response = generate_content(prompt, file_uris=api_testing_uris)
```

**Selection Methods**:
- ✅ By filename pattern
- ✅ By content domain
- ✅ By file ID
- ✅ By combination of criteria

**Use Cases**:
- ✅ Different prompts → different context sets
- ✅ Progressive context addition (narrow → broad)
- ✅ Context filtering (remove irrelevant files)
- ✅ A/B testing with different context

---

### 4. Context in Chat Sessions

**How It Works**:
```python
# Step 1: Start chat with context
chat_result = start_chat(
    session_id="session_001",
    initial_message="Initial question",
    file_uris=[uri1, uri2, uri3]  # Context loaded
)

# Step 2: Continue with same context (implicit)
response = send_message(
    session_id="session_001",
    message="Follow-up question"
    # Context maintained automatically
)

# Step 3: Inject new context if needed
response = send_message(
    session_id="session_001",
    message="New question",
    file_uris=[uri1]  # Different context this turn
)
```

**Session Management**:
- ✅ Context persists across messages
- ✅ Initial context carried forward
- ✅ New context can be added to any message
- ✅ Sessions isolated from each other

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Multi-turn analysis with context
- ✅ Progressive refinement with context
- ✅ Context switching mid-conversation
- ✅ Conversation history maintained

### 5. Context Metadata & Inspection

**Available Information**:
```
File ID          - Unique identifier in registry
File Name        - Gemini API file reference
Display Name     - Human-readable filename
Size             - Bytes stored
MIME Type        - Content type
Uploaded At      - Creation timestamp
Expires At       - Expiration timestamp (48h)
Status           - Active/Expired
URI              - Full Gemini file URI
```

**Inspection Methods**:
- ✅ List all files: `list_files()`
- ✅ Get file info: `get_file_info(file_name)`
- ✅ Check status: `chat-history://{session_id}`
- ✅ Monitor expiration: Track uploaded_at + 48h

### 6. Context Clearing & Lifecycle

**Complete Lifecycle**:

```
[1] LOAD → Upload context files to Gemini API
    - Files stored on Gemini servers
    - 48-hour lifetime begins
    - File URIs obtained

[2] USE → Query/analyze with context
    - Include file_uris in API calls
    - Single or multi-file queries
    - Chat sessions with context

[3] MANAGE → Inspect and modify context
    - List files with list_files()
    - Check metadata with get_file_info()
    - Understand expiration timeline

[4] CLEAR → Remove context when complete
    - Delete specific files: delete_file(file_name)
    - Or wait for 48-hour auto-expiration
    - Frees up API quota

[5] VERIFY → Confirm cleanup
    - Check with list_files()
    - Verify 0 files remaining
    - Ready for new context
```

**Cleanup Guarantees**:
- ✅ Explicit deletion via delete_file()
- ✅ Automatic deletion after 48 hours
- ✅ No context leakage between uses
- ✅ Fresh state for new sessions
