# Tor Metrics port
# Enable this if you want to export metrics from the Tor probing process.
#
# WARNING: Before enabling this, it is important to understand that exposing
# tor metrics publicly is dangerous to the Tor network users. Please take extra
# precaution and care when opening this port. Set a very strict access policy
# with `metrics_port_policy` and consider using your operating systems firewall
# features for defense in depth.
#
# We recommend, for the prometheus format, that the only address that can
# access this port should be the Prometheus server itself. Remember that the
# connection is unencrypted (HTTP) hence consider using a tool like stunnel to
# secure the link from this port to the server.
#
# The folloing should work by default for a local network, including local
# Docker containers (not recommended):
metrics_port: '0.0.0.0:9936'
metrics_port_policy: 'accept 192.168.0.0/16,accept 10.0.0.0/8,accept 172.16.0.0/12'
