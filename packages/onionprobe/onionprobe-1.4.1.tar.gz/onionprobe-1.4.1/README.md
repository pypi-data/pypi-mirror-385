# Onionprobe

![](docs/assets/logo.jpg "Onionprobe")

Onionprobe is a tool for testing and monitoring the status of
[Tor Onion Services](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/) sites.

It can run a single time or continuously to probe a set of onion services
endpoints and paths, optionally exporting to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io)
and with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) support.

The full documentation is available in the [docs/][] folder and at the
[Onionprobe website][].
