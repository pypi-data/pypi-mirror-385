## 🛣️ Status & Roadmap

Hassette is brand new and under active development. We follow semantic versioning and recommend pinning a minor version while the API stabilizes.

Hassette development is tracked in [this project](https://github.com/users/NodeJSmith/projects/1) (still a slight work-in-progress) - open an issue or PR if you'd like to contribute or provide feedback!

### Current Focus Areas

- 📚 **Comprehensive documentation**
- 🔐 **Enhanced type safety**: Service calls/responses, additional state types
- 🏗️ **Entity classes**: Include state data and service functionality (e.g. `LightEntity.turn_on()`)
- 🔄 **Enhanced error handling**: Better retry logic and error recovery
- 🧪 **Testing improvements**:
  - 📊 More tests for core and utilities
  - 🛠️ Test fixtures and framework for user apps
  - 🚫 No more manual state changes in HA Developer Tools for testing!
