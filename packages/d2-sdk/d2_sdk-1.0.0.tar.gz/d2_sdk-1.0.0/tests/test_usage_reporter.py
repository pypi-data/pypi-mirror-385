"""
Tests for d2.usage_reporter â€“ buffer logic & HTTP send path.

The UsageReporter collects telemetry events in memory and periodically
sends them to the D2 cloud service. These tests verify:

1. Event buffering and flushing behavior
2. HTTP request format and error handling  
3. Buffer overflow protection
4. Telemetry payload enrichment with system metadata

Key concepts:
- Events are buffered in memory (deque) up to a size limit
- Periodic flushing sends events via HTTP POST
- Each event gets enriched with service, host, pid, etc.
- Buffer overflow drops oldest events (LRU behavior)
