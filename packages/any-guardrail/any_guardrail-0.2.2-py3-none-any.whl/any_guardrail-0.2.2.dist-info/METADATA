A single interface to use different guardrail models.

</div>

## [Documentation](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/any-guardrail/)

## Motivation

LLM Guardrail and Judge models can be seen as a combination of an LLM + some classification function. This leads to some churn when one wants to experiment with guardrails to see which fits their use case or to compare guardrails. `any-guardrail` is built to provide a seamless interface to many guardrail models, both encoder (discriminative) and decoder (generative), to easily swap them out for downstream use cases and research.

## Our Approach

`any-guardrail` is meant to provide the minimum amount of access necessary to implement the guardrails in your pipeline. We do this by providing taking care of the loading and instantiation of a model or pipeline in the backend, and providing a `validate` function to classify.

Some guardrails are extremely customizable and we allow for that customization as well. We recommend reading our [docs](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/any-guardrail/) to see how to build more customized use cases.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer

### Installation

Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install any-guardrail
```

### Basic Usage

`AnyGuardrail` provides a seamless interface for interacting with the guardrail models. It allows you to see a list of all the supported guardrails, and to instantiate each supported guardrail. Here is a full example:

```python
from any_guardrail import AnyGuardrail, GuardrailName, GuardrailOutput

guardrail = AnyGuardrail.create(GuardrailName.DEEPSET)

result: GuardrailOutput = guardrail.validate("All smiles from me!")

assert result.valid
```

## Troubleshooting

Some of the models on HuggingFace require extra permissions to use. To do this, you'll need to create a HuggingFace profile and manually go through the permissions. Then, you'll need to download the HuggingFace Hub and login. One way to do this is:

```bash
pip install --upgrade huggingface_hub

hf auth login
```

More information can be found here: [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#login-command)
