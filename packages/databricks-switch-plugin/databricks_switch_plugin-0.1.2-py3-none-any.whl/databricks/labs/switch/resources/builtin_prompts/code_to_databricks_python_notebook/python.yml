  Convert Python code to Databricks-optimized Python code according to the following instructions and guidelines:

  # Input and Output
  - Input: Python script file (.py) containing Python code, functions, classes, and logic.
  - Output: Python code suitable for execution in a Databricks notebook with Python comments in {comment_lang}.

  # Instructions
  1. Convert the input Python code into Databricks-compatible Python code.
  2. The output should be Python code and Python comments only.
  3. DO NOT omit any part of the conversion. Include any non-convertible parts as Python comments with explanations.
  4. DO NOT output explanation strings between cells. Just output Python code and Python comments.
  5. DO NOT include cell separators or notebook-level descriptions as these will be added by another program.

  # Guidelines

  ## 1. Databricks Environment:
  - Include a setup section at the beginning with necessary imports.
  - DO NOT create a new SparkSession. Databricks provides `spark` by default.
  - Use `dbutils` for file system operations and utilities.

  ## 2. File System Operations:
  - Convert local file paths to Unity Catalog volumes (`/Volumes/catalog/schema/volume/path`).
  - Use `dbutils.fs` for file operations when appropriate.
  - Handle CSV/data file reading with Spark when files are large.
  - Provide examples using Unity Catalog volume paths instead of deprecated DBFS.

  ## 3. Library Management:
  - Convert `pip install` commands to `%pip install` magic commands.
  - Add `dbutils.library.restartPython()` after package installations when needed.

  ## 4. Data Processing Optimization:
  - Convert pandas operations to PySpark for large datasets where beneficial.
  - Use `display()` instead of `print()` for DataFrames and visualizations.
  - DO NOT use `collect()`, for/while loops, or `iterrows()` for large data processing.
  - Use Spark DataFrame operations (`map`, `filter`, `groupBy`, etc.) for scalable processing.

  ## 5. Parameter Handling:
  - Convert command-line arguments or config files to Databricks widgets:
    - Use `dbutils.widgets.text()`, `dbutils.widgets.dropdown()` for input parameters.
    - Use `dbutils.widgets.get()` to retrieve parameter values.
    - Convert to correct data types (e.g., `int(dbutils.widgets.get("param_name"))`).
    - Place widget creation at the beginning of the code.

  ## 6. Error Handling:
  - Wrap critical operations in `try-except` blocks.
  - Use `dbutils.notebook.exit("<message>")` to stop execution upon critical errors.
  - Add logging and progress indicators for long-running operations.

  ## 7. Code Organization:
  - Group related operations into logical sections (setup, processing, output).
  - Add {comment_lang} comments explaining complex logic and conversion decisions.
  - Start each logical section with a high-level comment describing its purpose.

  ## 8. Special Handling:
  - **`if __name__ == "__main__"`**: Convert main block to regular execution code.
  - **Configuration files**: Convert to Databricks secrets or widgets.
  - **Database connections**: Provide examples for cloud database connections.
  - **Caching**: Add caching hints for reused DataFrames (`df.cache()`).

  ## 9. Performance Considerations:
  - Include partitioning recommendations in comments for large datasets.
  - Suggest cluster configuration in comments when resource-intensive.
  - Identify operations that benefit from Spark parallelization.

  Generate Databricks-optimized Python code that maintains original functionality while leveraging Databricks capabilities and following best practices.
