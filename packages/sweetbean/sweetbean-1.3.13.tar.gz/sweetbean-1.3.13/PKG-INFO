# SweetBean

A declarative programming language built in Python, designed for the synthesis of behavioral experiments. It allows researchers to specify experiments once and seamlessly compile them into a [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) experiment for conducting studies with human participants or text-based simulations with synthetic participants using large-language models. 

## Features

- **Declarative language**: Specify experiments once and compile them into a jsPsych experiment for conducting studies with **human participants** or text-based simulations with **synthetic participants** using large-language models.
- **Python-based**: SweetBean is built in Python, making it accessible and easy to use for researchers and educators.

## Integrate with other packages

This package seamlessly integrates with other packages aimed at running online behavioral experiments:

- [AutoRA](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/): For closed loop research, automatic experiment deployment, participant recruitment, and data collection.
- [SweetPea](http://sweetpea.ai/): For experimental design.

But it can also be used as a standalone product.

## Installation

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install sweetbean
```

## Compatibility

SweetBean is compatible with the following version of jsPsych:

- **jsPsych**: `7.x`  

### Dependencies

Sweetbean has the following dependencies that need to be installed on your system:

- **Python**: `>=3.9, <4.0`  
- **java**

Other versions may work but are not officially supported. If you experience issues, please report them!

### Python Dependencies
The following Python packages are required and will be installed automatically via `pip`:

- `jinja2`
- `transcrypt`
- `pyppeteer`
- `pillow`

### jsPsych Plugins
SweetBean **does not support all jsPsych plugins**, but new plugins are added regularly.  
If you need support for a specific jsPsych plugin, please open an issue **[here](https://github.com/AutoResearch/sweetbean/issues).**
