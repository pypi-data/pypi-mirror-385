class LRUSet:
    """
    A set-like data structure with Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy.

    This class maintains insertion order based on recency and enforces uniqueness
    using equality comparison (`==`), not hashing. Unlike standard sets, it does not
    require elements to be hashableâ€”only that they implement `__eq__`.

    Internally, items are stored in a list in LRU order (oldest at index 0).
    Both `add` and `contains` operations have O(n) time complexity.

    When the capacity is exceeded, the least recently used item is evicted.
