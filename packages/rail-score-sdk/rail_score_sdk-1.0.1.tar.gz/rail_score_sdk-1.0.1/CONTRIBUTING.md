## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to research@responsibleailabs.ai.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a new branch for your changes
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sdks.git
cd sdks/python

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks (if available)
# pre-commit install
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-endpoint` - for new features
- `fix/authentication-error` - for bug fixes
- `docs/update-readme` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/client-structure` - for refactoring

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

Example:
```
Add support for custom timeout configuration

- Add timeout parameter to RailScoreClient
- Update documentation with timeout examples
- Add tests for timeout behavior

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=rail_score_sdk --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_client.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_client.py::test_calculate
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test structure

Example:
```python
def test_calculate_with_custom_domain():
    """Test calculate endpoint with custom domain parameter."""
    client = RailScoreClient(api_key="test-key")
    result = client.calculate(
        content="Test content",
        domain="healthcare"
    )
    assert result.rail_score > 0
```

## Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

### Black (Code Formatting)

```bash
# Format all files
black rail_score_sdk/

# Check formatting without modifying files
black --check rail_score_sdk/
```

### Flake8 (Linting)

```bash
# Run linter
flake8 rail_score_sdk/
```

### MyPy (Type Checking)

```bash
# Run type checker
mypy rail_score_sdk/
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

Example:
```python
def calculate(
    self,
    content: str,
    domain: str = "general",
    explain_scores: bool = True,
) -> RailScoreResponse:
    """
    Calculate RAIL score for content.

    Args:
        content: Text content to evaluate (20-50000 characters)
        domain: Content domain (general, healthcare, law, etc.)
        explain_scores: Include detailed explanations for scores

    Returns:
        RailScoreResponse with score, grade, and dimension analysis

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If content is invalid
        AuthenticationError: If API key is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
```
