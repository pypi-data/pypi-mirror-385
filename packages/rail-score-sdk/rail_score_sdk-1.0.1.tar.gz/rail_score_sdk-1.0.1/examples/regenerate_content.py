print("""
1. Calculate RAIL score first to identify specific weaknesses
2. Target 2-4 dimensions at a time for focused improvements
3. Provide clear, specific user_notes for better results
4. Use keep_structure=True for maintaining format (lists, sections)
5. Use keep_tone=True for consistent brand voice
6. Consider iterative improvements for complex content
7. Review changes_made to understand what was improved
8. Compare before/after scores to measure improvement
9. Test with your specific domain (healthcare, finance, etc.)
10. Validate improved content still meets your requirements

Structure vs Tone:
- keep_structure=True: Maintains format, layout, organization
- keep_tone=True: Preserves formality, emotion, voice
- Both can be combined or used independently
