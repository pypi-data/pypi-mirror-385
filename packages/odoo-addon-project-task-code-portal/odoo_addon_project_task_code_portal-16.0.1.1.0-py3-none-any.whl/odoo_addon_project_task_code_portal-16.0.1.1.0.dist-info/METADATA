Use Cases / Context
===================

Business Need
-------------

Task codes provide great flexibility for backend users. However portal
users still have to deal with task id's instead of task codes, which can
be misleading and create potential issues.

Approach
--------

This module extends the standard project portal by allowing:

- Searching for tasks by their unique code.
- Displaying the task code in both list and detail views.
- Generating reports that include the task code.

Use Cases
---------

- Clients can directly access a task via a URL containing the task code.
- Support teams can quickly locate a task using its unique identifier.

Configuration
=============

No configuration is required.

Usage
=====

This module will replace the "ID" field with the "Code" in the following
portal views:

- Task list (including the project task list)
- Task page
- Task search

It will modify the portal URLs as follows:

- **Before:** ``https://example.com/my/tasks/<task_id>``
- **After:** ``https://example.com/my/tasks/<task_code>``
