## Business Need
Task codes provide great flexibility for backend users. However portal users still have to deal with task id's instead of task codes, which can be misleading and create potential issues.

## Approach
This module extends the standard project portal by allowing:
- Searching for tasks by their unique code.
- Displaying the task code in both list and detail views.
- Generating reports that include the task code.

## Use Cases
- Clients can directly access a task via a URL containing the task code.
- Support teams can quickly locate a task using its unique identifier.
