pyside6-qml-stubgen
===================

Generate QML stub files (`.qmltypes`) from Python modules (which use PySide6)

Installation
------------

This tool can be installed though PyPI:

```bash
pip install pyside6-qml-stubgen
```

If you want to use a development version, instead clone the repo and then install using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matsjoyce/pyside6-qml-stubgen.git
pip install ./pyside6-qml-stubgen
```

This tool has been tested on Linux, Windows and MacOS using pip-installed PySide6 (on GitHub Actions), and on Arch Linux using system packages. It does not run with PyQt6, although it should be possible in theory (send a PR if you get it working). And finally, it does not run using Qt 5 (PySide2 or PyQt5), as that version is no longer being developed, and QML in Qt 5 has less features than in Qt 6, making it a less attractive target for this sort of tool.

Simple example
--------------

As an example, we'll run this tool on https://github.com/matsjoyce/fantasia2. There are two steps to type checking your QML code when using PySide6. First generate the QML type stubs using this tool:

```bash
pyside6-qml-stubgen fantasia2 --out-dir qmltypes --ignore fantasia2/alembic/
```

This command will generate a folder tree containing `.qmltypes` files and `qmldir` files matching the runtime structure of QML modules registered by the Python modules.

The second step is to run `qmllint` on your QML files using the type stubs:

```bash
/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmllint fantasia2/*.qml -I ./qmltypes
```

If you change the QML files, you can just rerun `qmllint`. If you change the Python interface, you should rerun both commands.

Links to other projects
-----------------------

This tool relies heavily on PySide6, and is inspired by the [`metaobjectdump.py`](https://code.qt.io/cgit/pyside/pyside-setup.git/tree/sources/pyside-tools/metaobjectdump.py) tool, although this tool uses a runtime approach instead of static analysis, as that works better on large programs.

Command-line arguments
----------------------

```bash
$ pyside6-qml-stubgen --help
Generate QML stub files (.qmltypes) from Python modules (which use PySide6)

Usage:
    pyside6-qml-stubgen <in-dir>... --out-dir=<out-dir> [--ignore=<path>...] [--metatypes-dir=<dir>] [--qmltyperegistrar-path=<path>] [--force-rebuild] [--file-relative-path=<div>] [--extra-external-modules=<modules>]
    pyside6-qml-stubgen (-h | --help)
    pyside6-qml-stubgen --version

Options:
    --ignore=<path>                     Ignore all Python files that are children of this path
    --metatypes-dir=<dir>               Directory of the Qt 6 metatype files for core modules (automatically detected if not provided)
    --qmltyperegistrar-path=<path>      Path of the qmltyperegistrar tool (automatically detected if not provided)
    --force-rebuild                     Rebuild the stubs from scratch instead of doing a partial update
    --file-relative-path=<div>          Make all paths in generated type files relative to this path
                                            (useful for if the generated stubs need to be used on different systems)
    --extra-external-modules=<modules>  Additional modules which should be assumed to contain QML exposed types (comma separated)
    -h --help                           Show this screen
    --version                           Show version
```
