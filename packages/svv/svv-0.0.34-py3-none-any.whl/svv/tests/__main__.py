"""
This file launches the testing suite for the svVascularize (svv)
package. You can run the test suite with the following command:

`python -m svv.tests [pytest args]

The real test files are in the top-level ``tests/`` folder of the
source code and not packaged within the distibution wheels. If you
would like to run the tests, you will require the full repo.
