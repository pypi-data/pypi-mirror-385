### Feature

* feat: Add concatenate_files function ([`657519a`](https://github.com/undo76/loppers/commit/657519aac83a2c0486ca7fa20450a15496d41857))

## v2.1.0 (2025-10-17)

### Chore

### Feature

* feat: Add collapse-single-dirs option to collapse deep package hierarchies

Add new --collapse-single-dirs flag to tree command for collapsing directories
with single children into compact paths (e.g., main/java/com/example).

Useful for Java packages and other hierarchical naming schemes where directories
have only a single child all the way down.

Changes:
- tree_as_str() now accepts collapse_single_dirs parameter
- get_tree() API adds collapse_single_dirs parameter
- CLI commands get --collapse-single-dirs flag
- Updated README with examples and documentation

Example:
  Without: main/java/com/example/ (4 lines)
  With:    main/java/com/example (1 line)

### Refactor

* refactor: Convert API from multiple paths to single root parameter

Major API changes:
- find_files(root) now takes single root directory, returns relative paths
- get_tree(root) now takes single root directory with same options as find_files
- CLI commands (concatenate, tree, files) now accept single root instead of multiple paths

Benefits:
- Simpler, more intuitive API with single root concept
- Cleaner file paths relative to root (not absolute)
- Consistent with typical CLI tools (find, ls, etc.)
- File headers in concatenate output use relative paths

Breaking Changes:
- find_files() signature changed from list of paths to single root
- get_tree() signature changed from list of file paths to root directory
- CLI positional argument changed from &#34;paths&#34; to &#34;root&#34;
- Return type of find_files() changed from list[Path] to list[str]

All 31 tests updated and passing.

* fix: Use top-level version field for semantic-release

- Move version to top-level in pyproject.toml
- Mark version as dynamic in [project] section
- Use version_variables (plural) configuration
- This allows semantic-release to update version at top level

* fix: Configure semantic-release for proper version updates

- Use standard version_variable path: pyproject.toml:version
- Add explicit parser configuration for conventional commits
- Remove __version__ from __init__ (use pyproject.toml as single source)
- Keep build_command empty (publish workflow handles building)

This setup separates concerns:
- semantic-release: Updates version, creates tags/releases
- publish workflow: Builds and publishes to PyPI

### Feature

* feat: Add __version__ to package for semantic-release versioning

Add __version__ string to src/loppers/__init__.py that semantic-release
can update. This is more reliable than updating TOML files.

semantic-release will now update this version on releases.

### Fix

* fix: Correct version_variable path for semantic-release

The version in pyproject.toml is nested under [project], so the path
should be &#39;pyproject.toml:project.version&#39; not &#39;pyproject.toml:version&#39;.

This enables semantic-release to properly update the version during releases.

### Fix

* fix: Disable build in semantic-release, let publish workflow handle it

semantic-release runs in isolated environment without build dependencies.
The publish workflow already handles building (uv build) and publishing.

semantic-release should focus on:
- Updating version in pyproject.toml
- Creating CHANGELOG entries
- Creating git tags and GitHub releases

The publish workflow (on release published) will:
- Build the package (uv build)
- Publish to PyPI

This separation of concerns works better with the GitHub Actions ecosystem.

* fix: Use python -m build instead of uv build in semantic-release

The semantic-release action runs in its own environment where &#39;uv&#39; is not
available in PATH. Use &#39;python -m build&#39; which only requires the &#39;build&#39;
package (already available as a dev dependency).

This allows the build step to work properly during automated releases.

This test commit verifies:
- Stable version of semantic-release action (v9.8.3)
- Version variable update from pyproject.toml configuration
- Build command using uv build
- Proper environment variables for GitHub and PyPI

Expected outcome:
- Version bumped from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 (patch bump for fix)
- CHANGELOG.md updated with this commit
- New GitHub release created (v1.0.2)
- Package built and published to PyPI

* fix: Remove invalid build_command parameter from GitHub Action

The GitHub Action does not accept build_command as an input parameter.
The build_command is configured in pyproject.toml under [tool.semantic_release]
and will be read from there by the action.

Valid action parameters: entryPoint, args, root_options, directory, github_token,
git_committer_name, git_committer_email, ssh keys, prerelease, force, commit,
tag, push, changelog, vcs_release, build_metadata

* fix: Simplify version_variable configuration for semantic-release

- Update version_variable back to simple format: &#34;pyproject.toml:version&#34;
- Add directory parameter to GitHub Action for clarity
- This should allow semantic-release to properly update the version field

The nested TOML path might not be supported by the Python semantic-release
action, so we&#39;re using the simpler format that maps to the top-level version
variable directly.

* fix: Fix semantic-release to properly update version in pyproject.toml

**Root causes fixed:**
1. Using unstable @master version of semantic-release action
2. Incorrect version_variable path (was &#34;pyproject.toml:version&#34;, should be &#34;pyproject.toml:project.version&#34;)
3. Using &#34;python -m build&#34; instead of &#34;uv build&#34;
4. Insufficient parameters in GitHub Action configuration

**Changes:**
- Update action to stable version: python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release@v9.8.3
- Fix version_variable path to proper TOML notation: pyproject.toml:project.version
- Update build_command to use uv: &#34;uv build&#34;
- Add proper environment variables: GH_TOKEN, PYPI_TOKEN
- Simplify GitHub Action parameters, relying on pyproject.toml config

**How it works now:**
1. Push commits to main with conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, etc.)
2. semantic-release detects version bump requirement
3. Automatically updates version in pyproject.toml:project.version
4. Builds package with &#34;uv build&#34;
5. Creates git tag and commits changes
6. Pushes to GitHub
7. Creates GitHub Release
8. Publishes to PyPI (via upload_to_pypi = true)

Next release will automatically update the version. No manual intervention needed!

- publish workflow will build and publish on release

Expected outcome:
- Version bumped in pyproject.toml
- CHANGELOG updated
- GitHub release created
- Publish workflow triggered automatically

### Refactor

* refactor: Use binaryornot library for simpler binary file detection

- Replace filetype with binaryornot (lightweight, focused library)
- Simplify is_binary_file() to 4 lines with clear logic
- binaryornot uses proven detection methods:
  * Known binary file extensions
  * Null byte detection
  * UTF-8 decoding validation
- Remove complexity, use battle-tested library
- Update tests to match binaryornot&#39;s detection behavior
- Update documentation

**Advantages:**
- Simpler, more focused implementation
- Well-maintained library by David Wolever
- Smaller dependency footprint
- Same reliability with less code

**Tests:**
- 24/24 passing
- Binary detection tests use null bytes (what binaryornot checks for)
- All concatenation and extraction tests passing

* refactor: Use filetype library for robust binary file detection

- Add `filetype&gt;=1.2.0` to dependencies
- Replace custom binary detection with filetype library (magic bytes)
- Use multi-stage detection:
  1. Magic bytes analysis via filetype (most accurate)
  2. MIME type classification (text vs binary)
  3. UTF-8 decoding + null byte detection (fallback)
- Update is_binary_file() signature (removes chunk_size parameter)
- Update tests to use real file signatures:
  * PDF magic bytes for PDF detection
  * PNG/JPEG/GIF magic bytes for image detection
  * Real binary content with null bytes
- Better detection of actual file types vs extensions
- More reliable across different file types

**Benefits:**
- Robust detection based on file content, not just extension
- Supports 50+ file types natively via filetype
- Graceful fallback for unknown types
- Pure Python implementation (no system dependencies)

**Tests:**
- 24/24 passing
- All binary detection tests use real magic bytes
- Real PDF signatures, image magic bytes
- Null byte detection for edge cases

* refactor: Move file concatenation to library with binary file detection

- Create new `concatenator.py` module for file operations
- Add `is_binary_file()` function with multi-method detection:
  * Known binary extensions (.pdf, .jpg, .exe, .bin, etc.)
  * Null byte detection
  * UTF-8 decoding validation
- Move `concatenate_files()` and `collect_files()` from CLI to library
- Add `extract_skeletons` parameter to control skeleton extraction
- Auto-skip binary files, include all text files
- Support mixing files and directories in single call
- Add CLI flag `--no-extract` to include original file content
- Export new functions in __init__.py (7 public functions total)
- Add comprehensive test suite (10 new tests):
  * Binary file detection tests
  * File concatenation tests
  * Skeleton extraction integration tests
- Update API documentation with usage examples

**Breaking Changes:**
- `concatenate_files()` signature changed (added `extract_skeletons` parameter)
- Moved from `cli.py` to `concatenator.py` module

**Tests:**
- 24/24 passing (14 skeleton extraction + 10 new utility tests)

### Fix

* fix: Disable build in semantic-release action

Semantic-release runs in a container and can&#39;t access the build tool. Since the publish.yml workflow handles building and publishing, we can disable building in semantic-release by setting build: false. ([`4e7bdcb`](https://github.com/undo76/loppers/commit/4e7bdcba2a7e9159feb6953385a607c992cbed29))

* fix: Install build tool with pip before semantic-release runs

The GitHub Actions workflow now explicitly installs &#39;build&#39; with pip to ensure it&#39;s available when semantic-release runs the build command. This avoids PATH issues with uv&#39;s virtual environment. ([`6dbb52f`](https://github.com/undo76/loppers/commit/6dbb52fffbe27df5030c2b49e210ebda0ebf80c8))

* fix: Use .venv/bin/python for build command in GitHub Actions

The &#39;uv sync&#39; workflow step creates a .venv directory. semantic-release needs to use the Python from that venv, not the system Python. ([`1249711`](https://github.com/undo76/loppers/commit/12497119d121e2fcf3b96dcefb5dc33d4f1391fd))

* fix: Use python -m build directly in semantic-release build command

When semantic-release runs the build command in GitHub Actions, &#39;uv&#39; is not in the PATH even though setup-uv was called. Since &#39;uv sync&#39; already installed all dependencies, we can run &#39;python -m build&#39; directly. ([`a98dfa3`](https://github.com/undo76/loppers/commit/a98dfa308ddc82b222d54994bef403010cb1d5ba))

* fix: Update semantic release configuration for uv package manager

- Update build command to use &#39;uv run python -m build&#39; instead of pip
- Add &#39;build&#39; to uv dev-dependencies so it&#39;s available in the environment
