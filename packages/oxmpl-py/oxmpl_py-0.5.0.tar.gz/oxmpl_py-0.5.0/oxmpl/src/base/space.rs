/// Defines a space in which planning can be performed.
///
/// A `StateSpace` represents the manifold where states exist. It defines the properties and
/// operations applicable to that space as a whole, such as how to measure distance, how to
/// interpolate between states, and how to generate new states.
///
/// This trait is generic and can be implemented for various types of spaces, like N-dimensional
/// Euclidean vectors (`RealVectorStateSpace`) or 2D rotations (`SO2StateSpace`). Planners are
/// written to be generic over this trait, allowing them to solve problems in any space that
/// implements these fundamental operations.
