/// An implementation of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Connect (RRT-Connect) algorithm.
///
/// RRT-Connect is a bidirectional search algorithm that grows two trees, one from the start state
/// (`start_tree`) and one from a goal state (`goal_tree`). It is generally much faster at finding
/// solutions than the standard RRT algorithm, especially in open spaces.
///
/// # Algorithm Overview
/// 1. Initialize two trees: `start_tree` with the start state, and `goal_tree` with a state from
///    the goal region.
/// 2. Loop:
///    a. Sample a random state `q_rand`.
///    b. Select which tree to grow (usually the smaller one to keep them balanced). Let's call it
///    `tree_a` and the other `tree_b`.
///    c. Try to `extend` `tree_a` towards `q_rand` to create a new state `q_new`.
///    d. If the extension was successful (a new node was added), try to `connect` `tree_b` to `q_new`.
///    The `connect` operation repeatedly calls `extend` from `tree_b` towards `q_new` until it
///    reaches `q_new` or gets stuck.
///    e. If the `connect` operation successfully reaches `q_new`, the two trees have been joined,
///    and a solution path is found by combining the paths from the start and goal to the
///    connection point.
///
/// # Trait Bounds

/// - The `State` type (`S`) must be `Clone`.
/// - The `Goal` type (`G`) must implement `GoalSampleableRegion` to initialize the goal tree.
