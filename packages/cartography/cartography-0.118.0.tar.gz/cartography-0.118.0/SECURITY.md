# Security Policy
Cartography is a security tool, and its community of course takes security very seriously.

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported versions
Security updates will typically only be applied to the latest release (at least until Cartography reaches the first stable major version).

## Reporting a vulnerability
To report a security issue, email cncf-cartography-maintainers@lists.cncf.io and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

Maintainers will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.
