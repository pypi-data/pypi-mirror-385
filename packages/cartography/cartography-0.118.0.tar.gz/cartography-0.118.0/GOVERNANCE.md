# Process for becoming a maintainer
Generally, express interest. This usually includes things like:
- Contributing 2+ PRs to Cartography.
- Regularly participating in discussion on GitHub, on Slack, or in our live video meetings.

# Maintainer responsibilities
- Hang out on Slack; delayed response is perfectly acceptable
- Triage GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.
- Deeply understand the project's best practices and development patterns.

# When does a maintainer lose maintainer status
- If a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status.
- If we do not hear from you in over a year, we may remove you from maintainer status without notice.

# Conflict resolution
We handle conflicts on a case-by-case basis. In general, let's talk it out (Slack, video call, etc). For larger issues we may need to involve more people to come to a decision.
