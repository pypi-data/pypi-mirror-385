### Checklist

Provide proof that this works (this makes reviews move faster). Please perform one or more of the following:
- [ ] Update/add unit or integration tests.
- [ ] Include a screenshot showing what the graph looked like before and after your changes.
- [ ] Include console log trace showing what happened before and after your changes.

If you are changing a node or relationship:
- [ ] Update the [schema](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/tree/master/docs/root/modules) and [readme](https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/docs/schema/README.md).

If you are implementing a new intel module:
- [ ] Use the NodeSchema [data model](https://cartography-cncf.github.io/cartography/dev/writing-intel-modules.html#defining-a-node).

- [ ] Confirm that the linter actually passes (submitting a PR where the linter fails shows reviewers that you did not test your code and will delay your review).
