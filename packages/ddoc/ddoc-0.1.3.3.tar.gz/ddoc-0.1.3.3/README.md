### Interfaces

2.1 Common Interfaces (Contracts)
• DataSource: Access to raw data (file/DB/streaming)
• Dataset: Standardized data units in batch/stream format
• Schema: Definition and validation of columns/features
• Transform: Preprocessing/feature extraction/format conversion
• EDA: Summary/profiling/visualization output
• DriftDetector: Detect drift in data/features/model (output)
• Reconstructor: Restore/sample missing/corrupted data
• Trainer: Model training/retraining
• Monitor: Online/offline monitoring and notifications
• Tracker: Experiment/artifact/lineage records
• Pipeline: Execution graph (node/edge) that links the above elements
• EventBus: Publish-subscribe execution/alert events

For each interface, a contract is defined as ABC (or typing.Protocol), and implementations are provided as plugins.
