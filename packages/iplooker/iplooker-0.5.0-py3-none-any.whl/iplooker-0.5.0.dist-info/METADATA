# iplooker

This script will perform a lookup for an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) using multiple sources. It can be used to get more information about an IP address, including the country, region, city, ISP, and any organization that may be associated to it.

## Usage

The script's primary purpose is looking up another IP address, but it can also tell you your current public IP address. You can combine the two to get a lookup for your public IP to see what other people might see if they were to look you up.

The script can also provide additional information from some services, including security-related information about an IP including whether it's a known VPN, proxy, Tor exit node, or datacenter. It can also provide ASN and IP ranges if available.

Here are the commands you can use:

```bash
# Running with no arguments will prompt for an IP
iplooker

# You can specify an IP as part of the command
iplooker 12.34.56.78

# You can use `-m` or `--me` to check your public IP
iplooker -m
iplooker --me

# You can do both with `-l` or `--lookup`
iplooker -l
iplooker --lookup

# Look up the ASN
iplooker -a
iplooker --asn

# Get the IP range the address is part of
iplooker -r
iplooker --range
```

## Installation

Install from `pip` with:

```bash
pip install iplooker
```

## Sources

It retrieves information from the following sources:

- ip-api.com
- ipapi.co
- ipapi.is
- ipdata.co
- ipgeolocation.io
- ipinfo.io
- iplocate.io

**NOTE:** The script currently uses my own API keys (obfuscated) for the lookups so that anyone can just download and go, but obviously this has potential for abuse. In the event that the script sees a lot of downloads or usage, I'll have to update it to default to free sources only with a bring-your-own-key approach, so please use responsibly!
