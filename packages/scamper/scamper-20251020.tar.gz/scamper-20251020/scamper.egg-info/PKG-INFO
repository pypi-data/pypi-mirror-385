Description-Content-Type: text/x-rst

scamper_ is a tool that actively probes the Internet in order to
analyze Internet topology and performance.

This scamper module provides convenient classes and methods for
interacting with scamper processes and data. The scamper module
has two related halves - classes for interacting with running
scamper processes (through ScamperCtrl and related classes) and
classes for reading and writing data previously collected with
scamper (ScamperFile). These classes are supported by other
classes that store measurement results. The types of measurements
supported by the scamper module include ping, traceroute, alias
resolution, DNS queries, HTTP, UDP probes, and packet capture.

See the documentation_ for examples.

The module requires two scamper libraries (libscamperctrl and
libscamperfile) to run, and their development headers to build.
These two scamper libraries are provided in the scamper source
code distribution, and are packaged for many operating systems, as
listed on the scamper_ website.  Where possible, use a package
provided by your operating system before resorting to compiling
and installing the libraries yourself.  Further, the Python module
is already provided in packaged form by some operating systems,
and you should use the packaged module where possible.
