# caniscrape 🔍

**Know before you scrape.** Analyze any website's anti-bot protections in seconds.

Stop wasting hours building scrapers only to discover the site has Cloudflare + JavaScript rendering + CAPTCHA + rate limiting. `caniscrape` does reconnaissance upfront so you know exactly what you're dealing with before writing a single line of code.

## 🎯 What It Does

`caniscrape` analyzes a URL and tells you:

- **What protections are active** (WAF, CAPTCHA, rate limits, TLS fingerprinting, honeypots)
- **Difficulty score** (0-10 scale: Easy → Very Hard)
- **Specific recommendations** on what tools/proxies you'll need
- **Estimated complexity** so you can decide: build it yourself or use a service

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install caniscrape
```

**Required dependency:**
```bash
# Install wafw00f (WAF detection)
pipx install wafw00f

# Install Playwright browsers (for JS detection)
playwright install chromium
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
caniscrape https://example.com
```

### Example Output
```

╭───────────────────────╮
│🛡️  ACTIVE PROTECTIONS │
╰───────────────────────╯
    ✅ robots.txt: Website allows scraping (for details on specific pages, navigate to <url>/robots.txt in your browser.)
    ❌ TLS Fingerprinting: Site blocks standard Python clients but allows browser-like clients.
    ✅ JavaScript: Not required for main content.
    ✅ Behavioral Analysis: No obvious honeypot traps detected.
    ❌ CAPTCHA: Cloudflare Turnstile detected (on page load).
    ❌ Rate Limiting: Blocked Immediately (Blocked after 1 requests with a 3.0s delay.)
    💡 Advice: This is likely due to client fingerprinting (TLS fingerprinting, User-Agent, etc.), not a classic rate limit.
       Run the analysis again. A different browser identity will be used, which may not be blocked.
       Otherwise, try the --impersonate flag, it will take longer but is likely to succeed.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────── 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Required Tools:
  • A CAPTCHA solving service (e.g., 2Captcha, Anti-Captcha).
  • A library with browser impersonation like curl_cffi, or a full headless browser.
  • A pool of high-quality proxies (residential or mobile) to rotate IP addresses.

Scraping Strategy:
  • Implement delays between requests (e.g., 3-5 seconds).
  • Integrate the CAPTCHA solver into your script to handle challenges when they appear.
  • Rotate User-Agents and other headers on every request.
  • Standard Python HTTP clients (like requests/aiohttp) will be blocked.

## 🔬 What It Analyzes

### 1. **WAF Detection**
Identifies Web Application Firewalls (Cloudflare, Akamai, Imperva, DataDome, PerimeterX, etc.)

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- Tests with burst and sustained traffic patterns
- Detects HTTP 429s, timeouts, throttling, soft bans
- Determines blocking threshold (requests/min)

### 3. **JavaScript Rendering**
- Compares content with/without JS execution
- Detects SPAs (React, Vue, Angular)
- Calculates percentage of content missing without JS

### 4. **CAPTCHA Detection**
- Scans for reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, Cloudflare Turnstile
- Tests if CAPTCHA appears on load or after rate limiting
- Monitors network traffic for challenge endpoints

### 5. **TLS Fingerprinting**
- Compares standard Python clients vs browser-like clients
- Detects if site blocks based on TLS handshake signatures

### 6. **Behavioral Analysis**
- Scans for invisible "honeypot" links (bot traps)
- Detects if site is monitoring mouse/scroll behavior

### 7. **robots.txt**
- Checks scraping permissions
- Extracts recommended crawl-delay

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Aggressive WAF Detection
```bash
# Find ALL WAFs (slower, may trigger rate limits)
caniscrape https://example.com --find-all
```

### Browser Impersonation
```bash
# Use curl_cffi for better stealth (slower but more likely to succeed)
caniscrape https://example.com --impersonate
```

### Deep Honeypot Scanning
```bash
# Check 2/3 of links (more accurate, slower)
caniscrape https://example.com --thorough

# Check ALL links (most accurate, very slow on large sites)
caniscrape https://example.com --deep
```

### Combine Options
```bash
caniscrape https://example.com --impersonate --find-all --thorough
```

## 📊 Difficulty Scoring

The tool calculates a 0-10 difficulty score based on:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **CAPTCHA on page load** | +5 points |
| **CAPTCHA after rate limit** | +4 points |
| **DataDome/PerimeterX WAF** | +4 points |
| **Akamai/Imperva WAF** | +3 points |
| **Aggressive rate limiting** | +3 points |
| **Cloudflare WAF** | +2 points |
| **Honeypot traps detected** | +2 points |
| **TLS fingerprinting active** | +1 point |

**Score interpretation:**
- **0-2**: Easy (basic scraping will work)
- **3-4**: Medium (need some precautions)
- **5-7**: Hard (requires advanced techniques)
- **8-10**: Very Hard (consider using a service)

## 🎓 Use Cases

### For Developers
- **Before building a scraper**: Check if it's even feasible
- **Debugging scraper issues**: Identify what protection broke your scraper
- **Client estimates**: Give accurate time/cost estimates for scraping projects

### For Data Engineers
- **Pipeline planning**: Know what infrastructure you'll need (proxies, CAPTCHA solvers)
- **Cost estimation**: Calculate proxy/CAPTCHA costs before committing to a data source

### For Researchers
- **Site selection**: Find the easiest data sources for your research
- **Compliance**: Check robots.txt before scraping

## ⚠️ Limitations & Disclaimers

### What It Can't Detect
- **Dynamic protections**: Some sites only trigger defenses under specific conditions
- **Behavioral AI**: Advanced ML-based bot detection that adapts in real-time
- **Account-based restrictions**: Protections that only activate for logged-in users

### Legal & Ethical Notes
- This tool is for **reconnaissance only** - it does not bypass protections
- Always respect `robots.txt` and terms of service
- Some sites may consider aggressive scanning hostile - use `--find-all` and `--deep` sparingly
- You are responsible for how you use this tool and any scrapers you build

### Technical Notes
- Analysis takes 30-60 seconds per URL
- Some checks require making multiple requests (may trigger rate limits)
- Results are a snapshot - protections can change over time
