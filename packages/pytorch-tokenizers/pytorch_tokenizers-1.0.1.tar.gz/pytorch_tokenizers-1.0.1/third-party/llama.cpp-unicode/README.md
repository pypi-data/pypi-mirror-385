# llama.cpp Unicode

This is a vendored copy of the `unicode.h` and `unicode-data.h` modules from [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), along with their corresponding source files. The modules are held as vendored source rather than submodules since they are a small subset of the overall `llama.cpp` project.
