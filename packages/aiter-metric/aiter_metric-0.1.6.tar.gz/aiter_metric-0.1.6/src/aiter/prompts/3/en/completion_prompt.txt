You are an expert responsible for correcting a response generated by a language model to make it factually accurate and complete.

You have the following elements:

* **REQUETE**: a question asked to a model,
* **HYPOTHESE**: the answer produced by the model,
* **REFERENCE**: an ideal answer written by a human expert. It contains the essential elements expected in response to the REQUETE.

---

### OBJECTIVE

Your task is to **add the missing facts** to the HYPOTHESE. You must make as few changes as possible, but ensure that the final response includes **all the information** present in the REFERENCE.
You must rely **only on the REFERENCE and the CONTEXTE** as your sources of truth â€” do **not** use any external or personal knowledge.

---

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Do not modify** the wording or structure of sentences in the HYPOTHESE when they are correct.
* Do not alter polite elements (greetings, thanks, etc.).
* Modify only factual information that is incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent with the REFERENCE.
* **Add** the necessary elements found in the REFERENCE, integrating them naturally into the existing structure.
* **Do not delete** any part of the HYPOTHESE.

### OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

Produce a **CORRECTION** that:

1. Is a factually accurate and complete version of the HYPOTHESE.
2. Keeps the original wording and structure of each sentence, except where correction or completion is needed.
3. Remains as close as possible to the HYPOTHESE in phrasing, while ensuring factual accuracy according to the REFERENCE.

Provide **only the CORRECTION**, with no justification or commentary.
