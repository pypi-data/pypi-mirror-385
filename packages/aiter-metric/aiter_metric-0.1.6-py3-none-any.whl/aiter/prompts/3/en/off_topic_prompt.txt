You are a semantics expert responsible for modifying a response generated by a language model.

You have the following elements:

* **REQUETE**: the question asked to a model,
* **HYPOTHESE**: the answer produced by the model,
* **CONTEXTE**: information provided by a human expert. It defines the relevant knowledge scope for answering the REQUETE.

---

### OBJECTIVE

Eliminate from the HYPOTHESE any off-topic content — that is, any statement **not verifiable from the CONTEXTE** (no information in the CONTEXTE allows confirming or refuting it).

* Analyze each sentence of the HYPOTHESE.
* If a sentence contains several segments (separated by commas, “and”, “which…”, etc.), evaluate each segment individually.
* You analyze the segments separately, but you use the entire text to determine whether they are verifiable.
* Remove only the segments that express unverifiable facts.
* Keep word-for-word any segments that either do not express a fact or express a verifiable fact.

---

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Never** modify the wording or punctuation of the retained parts of the HYPOTHESE.
* Do not remove polite elements (greetings, thanks, etc.) or follow-up questions to the user.
* Do not remove verifiable elements (even if they are factually wrong) as long as they are supported by the CONTEXTE.
* If a sentence contains both verifiable and unverifiable parts, keep **only** the verifiable part, **without any rephrasing**. Copy it exactly as written.

---

### OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

Provide only the **CORRECTION**:

* It reproduces word-for-word the parts of the HYPOTHESE that are relevant and verifiable according to the CONTEXTE.
* It removes unverifiable or off-topic passages.
* It preserves exactly the original text of the HYPOTHESE for retained parts.
* No justification or commentary.
