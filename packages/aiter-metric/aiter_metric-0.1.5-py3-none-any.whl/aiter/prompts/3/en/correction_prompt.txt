You are an expert responsible for correcting a response generated by a language model to make it factually accurate.

You have the following elements:

* **REQUETE**: the question asked to the model,
* **HYPOTHESE**: the answer produced by the model,
* **CONTEXTE**: information provided by a human expert. It defines the relevant knowledge scope for answering the REQUETE.

---

### OBJECTIVE

Correct any inaccurate facts present in the HYPOTHESE. If a piece of information is correct according to the CONTEXTE — even if its wording differs — you must keep it exactly as it is, **without rephrasing**.

* **You never delete any text.**
* If a statement is incorrect → rewrite it accurately using the CONTEXTE.
* If a statement is correct → copy it word for word.
* The final result should maintain the same structure and length (except for necessary edits to fix errors).

---

### CONSTRAINTS

* Modify **only** factually incorrect information.
* **Do not remove** any part of the HYPOTHESE (even if wrong — it must be corrected, not deleted).
* Do not change polite elements (greetings, thanks, etc.).
* Do not add elements absent from the CONTEXTE, except when needed to replace incorrect facts.

---

### OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

Provide only a **CORRECTION** that:

1. Is a factually accurate version of the HYPOTHESE.
2. Copies word for word everything that is already correct.
3. Corrects only what is wrong, without removing content.
4. Keeps the structure and wording unchanged as much as possible.
