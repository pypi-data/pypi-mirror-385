"""row_validation module removed.

Former functionality (schema row/type validation) has been consolidated into the
TypeCoercion preprocessor. This stub remains only to give a clear error if
legacy imports/functions are still referenced.

Update your pipeline to include the 'type_coercion' preprocessor for type and
format enforcement.
