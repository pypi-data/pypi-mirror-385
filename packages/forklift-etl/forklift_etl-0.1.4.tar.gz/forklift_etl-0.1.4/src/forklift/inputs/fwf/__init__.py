"""FWF (Fixed Width File) input processing package.

This package provides functionality for reading and processing fixed-width files
with support for conditional schemas, field validation, and data type conversion.

The package is organized into several modules:
- handlers: Main FwfInputHandler class
- validators: Configuration and field validation
- converters: Type conversion and value processing
- detectors: Encoding detection and schema detection
- parsers: Line parsing and field extraction
