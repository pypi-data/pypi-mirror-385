description = IDRiD (Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset), is the first database representative of an Indian population. Moreover, it is the only dataset constituting typical diabetic retinopathy lesions and also normal retinal structures annotated at a pixel level. This dataset provides information on the disease severity of diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema for each image. This makes it perfect for development and evaluation of image analysis algorithms for early detection of diabetic retinopathy.

description = The STARE (STructured Analysis of the Retina) Project was conceived and initiated in 1975 by Michael Goldbaum, M.D., at the University of California, San Diego. It was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health . During its history, over thirty people contributed to the project, with backgrounds ranging from medicine to science to engineering. Images and clinical data were provided by the Shiley Eye Center at the University of California, San Diego, and by the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Diego.

description = A public retinal vessel reference dataset CHASE_DB1 made available by Kingston University, London in collaboration with St. Georgeâ€™s, University of London. This is a subset of retinal images of multi-ethnic children from the Child Heart and Health Study in England (CHASE) dataset. This subset contains 28 retinal images captured from both eyes from 14 of the children recruited in the study. In this subset each retinal image is also accompanied by two ground truth images. This is provided in the form of two manual vessel segmentations made by two independent human observers for each of the images, in which each pixel is assigned a "1" label if it is part of a blood vessel and a "0" label otherwise. Making this subset publicly available allows for the scientific community to train and test computer vision algorithms (specifically vessel segmentation methodologies). Most importantly this subset allows for performance comparisons - several algorithms being evaluated on the same database allows for direct comparisons of their performances to be made.

description = The FIVES dataset consists of 800 high-resolution multi-disease color fundus photographs with pixelwise manual annotation. The annotation process was standardized through crowdsourcing among medical experts. The quality of each image was also evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest retinal vessel segmentation dataset
