# HDF5 Research Data Management Toolbox

*Note, that the project is still under development!*

The "HDF5 Research Data Management Toolbox" (h5RDMtoolbox) is a Python package supporting everybody who is working with
HDF5 to achieve a sustainable data lifecycle which follows
the [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
principles. It specifically supports the five main steps of *planning*, *collecting*, *analyzing*, *sharing* and
*reusing* data. Please visit the [documentation](https://h5rdmtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for detailed
information of try the [quickstart using colab](#quickstart).

## Highlights

- Combining HDF5 and [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) to allow easy access to metadata and data during
  analysis and processing (
  see [here](https://h5rdmtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/quickoverview.html#datasets-xarray-interface)).
- Assigning [metadata with "globally unique and persistent identifiers"]() as required
  by [F1 of the FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f1-meta-data-assigned-globally-unique-persistent-identifiers/).
  This can be achieved by using [RDF triples](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), which removes "ambiguity in the meaning of your
  published data".
- Define standard attributes through
  [conventions](https://h5rdmtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/convention/index.html) and enforce users to use
  certain attributes in their HDF5 files, such as units and a description, for example.
- Upload HDF5 files directly
  to [repositories](https://h5rdmtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/repository/index.html)
  like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
  or [use them with noSQL databases](https://h5rdmtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/database/index.html) like
  [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Who is the package for?

For everybody, who is...

- ... looking for a management approach for his or her data.
- ... community has not yet established a stable convention.
- ... working with small and big data, that fits into HDF5 files.
- ... looking for an easy way to work with HDF5, especially through [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).
- ... trying to integrate HDF5 with repositories and databases.
- ... wishing to enrich data semantically with the RDF standard.
- ... looking for a way to do all the above whiles not needing to learn a new syntax.
- ... new to HDF5 and wants to learn about it, especially with respect to the FAIR principles and data management.

## Who is it not for?

For everybody, who ...

- ... is looking for a management approach which at the same time allows high-performance and/or parallel work with HDF5
- ... has already well-established conventions and managements approaches in his or her community

## Package Architecture/structure

The toolbox implements six modules, which are shown below. The numbers reference to their main usage in the stages in
the data lifecycle above. The wrapper module implements the main interface between the user and the HDF5 file. It 
extends the features of the underlying `h5py` library. Some of the features are implemented in other modules, hence the 
wrapper module depends on the convention, database and linked data (ld) module.

<a href="https://h5rdmtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><img src="docs/_static/h5tbx_modules.svg" alt="H5TBX modules" style="widht:600px;"></a>

Current implementation highlights in the modules:

- The **wrapper** module adds functionality on top of the `h5py` package. It allows to include so-called standard names,
  which are defined in conventions. And it implements interfaces, such as to the package `xarray`, which allows to carry
  metadata from HDF5 to the user. Other high-level interfaces like `.rdf` allows assigning semantic information to the
  HDF5 file.
- For the **database** module, `hdfDB` and `mongoDB` are implemented. The `hdfDB` module allows to use HDF5 files as a
  database. The `mongoDB` module allows to use mongoDB as a database by mapping the metadata of HDF5 files to the
  database.
- For the **repository** module, a Zenodo interface is implemented. Zenodo is a repository, which allows to upload and
  download data with a persistent identifier.
- For the **convention** module,
  the [standard attributes](https://h5rdmtoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/standard_attributes_and_conventions.html)
  are implemented.
- The **layout** module allows to define expectations on the internal layout (object names, location, attributes,
  properties) of HDF5 files.

by click on the image, which shows the research data lifecycle in the center and the respective toolbox features on the
outside:

A paper is published in the journal [inggrid](https://preprints.inggrid.org/repository/view/23/).

## Installation

Use python 3.9 or higher (automatic testing is performed until 3.13). If you are a regular user, you can install the
package via pip:

    pip install h5RDMtoolbox


### Install from source:

Developers may clone the repository and install the package from source. Clone the repository first:

    git clone https://github.com/matthiasprobst/h5RDMtoolbox.git@main

Then, run

    pip install h5RDMtoolbox/

Add `--user` if you do not have root access.

For development installation run

    pip install -e h5RDMtoolbox/

### Dependencies

The core functionality depends on the following packages. Some of them are for general management others are very
specific to the features of the package:

**General dependencies are ...**

- `numpy>=1.20`: Scientific computing, handling of arrays
- `matplotlib>=3.5.2`: Plotting
- `appdirs>=1.4.4`: Managing user and application directories
