## TimSort

A C++ implementation of TimSort, an O(n log n) stable sorting algorithm, ported from Python's and OpenJDK's.

See also the following links for a detailed description of TimSort:
* http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort

According to the benchmarks, it is slower than `std::sort()` on randomized sequences, but faster on partially-sorted
ones. `gfx::timsort` should be usable as a drop-in replacement for `std::stable_sort`, with the difference that it
can't fallback to a O(n logÂ² n) algorithm when there isn't enough extra heap memory available.

Additionally `gfx::timsort` can take a [projection function](https://ezoeryou.github.io/blog/article/2019-01-22-ranges-projection.html)
after the comparison function. The support is a bit rougher than in the linked article or the C++20 stadard library:
only instances of types callable with parentheses can be used, there is no support for pointer to members.

## EXAMPLE

Example of using timsort with a comparison function and a projection function to sort a vector of strings by length:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <gfx/timsort.hpp>

size_t len(const std::string& str) {
    return str.size();
}

// Sort a vector of strings by length
std::vector<std::string> vec;
// ... fill vec ...
gfx::timsort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), std::less<size_t>(), &len);
```

## COMPATIBILITY

This library is compatible with C++98, but if you compile it with C++11 or higher it will try to use `std::move()`
when possible instead of copying vaues around, which notably allows to sort collections of move-only types (see
[#9](https://github.com/gfx/cpp-TimSort/pull/9) for details).

You can explicity control the use of `std::move()` by setting the macro `GFX_TIMSORT_USE_STD_MOVE` to `0` or `1`.

The library has been tested with the following compilers:
* GCC 5
* Clang 3.8
* The AppleClang version that ships with Xcode 8.3
* MSVC 2017 update 9

It should also work with more recent compilers, and most likely with some older compilers too.

The library can be installed on the system via CMake with the following commands:

```sh
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cd build
make install
```

## DIAGNOSTICS & INFORMATION

A few configuration macros allow gfx::timsort to emit diagnostic, which might be helpful to diagnose issues:
* Defining `GFX_TIMSORT_ENABLE_ASSERT` inserts assertions in key locations in the algorithm to avoid logic errors.
* Defining `GFX_TIMSORT_ENABLE_LOG` inserts logs in key locations, which allow to follow more closely the flow of the algorithm.

**cpp-TimSort** follows semantic versioning and provides the following macros to retrieve the current major, minor
and patch versions:

```cpp
GFX_TIMSORT_VERSION_MAJOR
GFX_TIMSORT_VERSION_MINOR
GFX_TIMSORT_VERSION_PATCH
```

## TESTS

The tests are written with Catch2 (branch 1.x) and can be compiled with CMake and run through CTest.

When using the project's main `CMakeLists.txt`, the CMake variable `BUILD_TESTING` is `ON` by default unless the
project is included as a subdirectory. The following CMake variables are available to change the way the tests are
built with CMake:
* `GFX_TIMSORT_USE_VALGRIND`: if `ON`, the tests will be run through Valgrind (`OFF` by default)
* `GFX_TIMSORT_SANITIZE`: this variable takes a comma-separated list of sanitizers options to run the tests (empty by default)

## BENCHMARKS

Benchmarks are available in the `benchmarks` subdirectory, and can be constructed directly by passing `BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON`
variable to CMake during the configuration step.
