class File(BaseModel, Generic[T], SerializableType):
    """
    A generic file class representing a file with a specified format.
    Provides both async and sync interfaces for file operations. All methods without _sync suffix are async.

    The class should be instantiated using one of the class methods. The constructor should be used only to
    instantiate references to existing remote objects.

    The generic type T represents the format of the file.

    Important methods:
    - `from_existing_remote`: Create a File object from an existing remote file.
    - `new_remote`: Create a new File reference for a remote file that will be written to.

    **Asynchronous methods**:
    - `open`: Asynchronously open the file and return a file-like object.
    - `download`: Asynchronously download the file to a local path.
    - `from_local`: Asynchronously create a File object from a local file, uploading it to remote storage.
    - `exists`: Asynchronously check if the file exists.

    **Synchronous methods** (suffixed with `_sync`):
    - `open_sync`: Synchronously open the file and return a file-like object.
    - `download_sync`: Synchronously download the file to a local path.
    - `from_local_sync`: Synchronously create a File object from a local file, uploading it to remote storage.
    - `exists_sync`: Synchronously check if the file exists.

    Example: Read a file input in a Task (Async).

    ```python
    @env.task
    async def read_file(file: File) -> str:
        async with file.open("rb") as f:
            content = bytes(await f.read())
            return content.decode("utf-8")
    ```

    Example: Read a file input in a Task (Sync).

    ```python
    @env.task
    def read_file_sync(file: File) -> str:
        with file.open_sync("rb") as f:
            content = f.read()
            return content.decode("utf-8")
    ```

    Example: Write a file by streaming it directly to blob storage (Async).

    ```python
    @env.task
    async def write_file() -> File:
        file = File.new_remote()
        async with file.open("wb") as f:
            await f.write(b"Hello, World!")
        return file
    ```

    Example: Upload a local file to remote storage (Async).

    ```python
    @env.task
    async def upload_file() -> File:
        # Write to local file first
        with open("/tmp/data.csv", "w") as f:
            f.write("col1,col2\\n1,2\\n3,4\\n")
        # Upload to remote storage
        return await File.from_local("/tmp/data.csv")
    ```

    Example: Upload a local file to remote storage (Sync).

    ```python
    @env.task
    def upload_file_sync() -> File:
        # Write to local file first
        with open("/tmp/data.csv", "w") as f:
            f.write("col1,col2\\n1,2\\n3,4\\n")
        # Upload to remote storage
        return File.from_local_sync("/tmp/data.csv")
    ```

    Example: Download a file to local storage (Async).

    ```python
    @env.task
    async def download_file(file: File) -> str:
        local_path = await file.download()
        # Process the local file
        with open(local_path, "r") as f:
            return f.read()
    ```

    Example: Download a file to local storage (Sync).

    ```python
    @env.task
    def download_file_sync(file: File) -> str:
        local_path = file.download_sync()
        # Process the local file
        with open(local_path, "r") as f:
            return f.read()
    ```

    Example: Reference an existing remote file.

    ```python
    @env.task
    async def process_existing_file() -> str:
        file = File.from_existing_remote("s3://my-bucket/data.csv")
        async with file.open("rb") as f:
            content = await f.read()
            return content.decode("utf-8")
    ```

    Example: Check if a file exists (Async).

    ```python
    @env.task
    async def check_file(file: File) -> bool:
        return await file.exists()
    ```

    Example: Check if a file exists (Sync).

    ```python
    @env.task
    def check_file_sync(file: File) -> bool:
        return file.exists_sync()
    ```

    Example: Pass through a file without copying.

    ```python
    @env.task
    async def pass_through(file: File) -> File:
        # No copy occurs - just passes the reference
        return file
