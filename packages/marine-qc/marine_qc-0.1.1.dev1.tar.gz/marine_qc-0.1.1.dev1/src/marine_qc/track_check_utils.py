"""
The New Track Check QC module provides the functions needed to perform the
track check. The main routine is mds_full_track_check which takes a
list of class`.MarineReport` from a single ship and runs the track check on them.
This is an update of the MDS system track check in that it assumes the Earth is a
sphere. In practice, it gives similar results to the cylindrical earth formerly
assumed.

    """
    Interpolate between alternate reports and compare the interpolated location to the actual location. e.g.
    take difference between reports 2 and 4 and interpolate to get an estimate for the position at the time
    of report 3. Then compare the estimated and actual positions at the time of report 3.

    The calculation linearly interpolates the latitudes and longitudes (allowing for wrapping around the
    dateline and so on).

    Parameters
    ----------
    lat : 1D np.ndarray of float
        One-dimensional latitude array in degrees.

    lon : 1D np.ndarray of float
        One-dimensional longitude array in degrees.

    timediff : 1D np.ndarray of datetime
        One-dimensional time difference array.

    Returns
    -------
    1D np.ndarray of float
        One-dimensional array of distances from estimated positions in kilometers.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If either input is not 1-dimensional or if their lengths do not match.
