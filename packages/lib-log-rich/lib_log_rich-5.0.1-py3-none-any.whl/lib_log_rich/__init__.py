"""Library façade exposing the temporary helper API.

Purpose
-------
Provide a tiny, import-only surface so documentation, doctests, and prototype
integrations can rely on stable helpers while the Rich-backed logging
architecture specified in ``docs/systemdesign/concept_architecture.md`` is
implemented.

Contents
--------
* :func:`hello_world` – deterministic success path for smoke tests and docs.
* :func:`summary_info` – formatted metadata banner sourced from
  :mod:`lib_log_rich.__init__conf__`.

System Role
-----------
Acts as the package-level façade referenced by README examples and
``module_reference.md`` so downstream code does not import implementation
modules directly.
