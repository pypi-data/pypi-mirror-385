               "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
               and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         
               "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
               the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         
               "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
               other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
               control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
               "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
               direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
               otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
               outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

               "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
               including but not limited to software source code, documentation
               source, and configuration files.
         
               "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
               transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
               not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
               and conversions to other media types.
         
               "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
               Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
               copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
               (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         
               "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
               form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
               editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
               represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
               of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
               separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

               or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
               the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
               means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
               to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
         
               To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
               boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
               replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
               the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
               comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
               file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
               same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
               identification within third-party archives.

# virtualshell

High-performance PowerShell automation for Python. `virtualshell` keeps a single PowerShell host warm and exposes it through a thin Python wrapper backed by a C++ engine. The result: millisecond-scale latency, async execution, and session persistence without juggling subprocesses.

> Full documentation now lives in the [project wiki](https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell/wiki). This README gives you the essentials and quick links.

---

## Why virtualshell?

- **Persistent session** – reuse modules, `$env:*`, and functions between calls.
- **Low latency** – avoid the 200+ ms penalty of `subprocess.run("pwsh")`; most commands settle in ~2-4 ms.
- **Async + batching** – schedule commands concurrently or in batches with strong timeout control.
- **Structured results** – every invocation returns stdout/stderr, exit code, success flag, and timing.
- **Predictable failures** – typed Python exceptions for “pwsh missing”, timeouts, and execution errors.

Typical users embed PowerShell inside Python orchestration, long-running agents, or test suites that need reliability and speed.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install virtualshell
```

Pre-built wheels are published for Windows, Linux (x86_64/aarch64), and macOS universal2. PowerShell (`pwsh` or `powershell.exe`) must be discoverable on `PATH` unless you pass an explicit path.

---

## Quick start

```python
from virtualshell import Shell

with Shell(timeout_seconds=5) as sh:
    result = sh.run("Write-Output 'Hello from pwsh'")
    print(result.out.strip())

    sh.run("function Inc { $global:i++; $global:i }")
    print(sh.run("Inc").out.strip())  # 1
    print(sh.run("Inc").out.strip())  # 2
```

### Async execution

```python
from virtualshell import Shell
import asyncio

async def main():
    shell = Shell().start()
    fut = shell.run_async("Get-Date")
    res = await asyncio.wrap_future(fut)
    print(res.out.strip())
    shell.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Scripts and arguments

```python
from pathlib import Path
from virtualshell import Shell

shell = Shell().start()

# Positional arguments
shell.script(Path("./scripts/test.ps1"), args=["alpha", "42"])

# Named arguments (hashtable splatting)
shell.script(
    Path("./scripts/test.ps1"),
    args={"Name": "Alice", "Count": "3"},
)

shell.stop()
```

Every API surface (sync/async/script) accepts `timeout` overrides and optional error raising via `raise_on_error` or callbacks.

---

## Core API overview

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Shell.run(cmd, *, timeout=None, raise_on_error=False)` | Execute a single command synchronously. |
| `Shell.run_async(cmd, *, callback=None, timeout=None)` | Schedule a command; returns a `concurrent.futures.Future`. |
| `Shell.script(path, args=None, *, timeout=None, dot_source=False, raise_on_error=False)` | Execute `.ps1` files with positional or named arguments. |
| `Shell.script_async(...)` | Async counterpart of `script`. |
| `Shell.save_session()` | Persist the current session to an XML snapshot. |
| `Shell.pwsh(text)` | Safely echo a literal PowerShell string (auto quoting). |

More helpers live in the wiki, including session restore, batching, and diagnostic tips.

---

## Configuration

```python
from virtualshell import Shell

shell = Shell(
    powershell_path=r"C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe",
    working_directory=r"C:\automation",
    environment={"MY_FLAG": "1"},
    initial_commands=[
        "$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'",
        "$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'",
    ],
    timeout_seconds=10,
    auto_restart_on_timeout=True,
)

shell.start()
```

Configuration is applied before the process starts. You can inspect or replace it later with `shell._core.get_config()` or rebuild the shell.

---

## Error handling

```python
from virtualshell import Shell
from virtualshell.errors import ExecutionError, ExecutionTimeoutError

shell = Shell().start()

try:
    shell.run("throw 'boom'", raise_on_error=True)
except ExecutionTimeoutError:
    print("Timed out")
except ExecutionError as exc:
    print("PowerShell failure:", exc)
finally:
    shell.stop()
```

Refer to `virtualshell.errors` for all exception types.

---

## Performance

Up-to-date benchmark artefacts (`bench.json`, `bench.csv`) and analysis live in [docs/wiki/Project/Benchmarks.md](docs/wiki/Project/Benchmarks.md). Headline numbers from the latest run (Windows 11, Python 3.13):

- Sequential commands: ~3.5 ms average
- Batch commands: ~3.2 ms per command
- Async latency: ~1.9–2.4 ms with 50 outstanding tasks
- Session save: ~0.30 s median

See the wiki for charts and methodology.
