## 1. Quick Start

### 1.1. Create a prompt file
Let’s start with a simple command that asks an LLM to translate text.

Create a prompt file named `translate.md` under your prompt configuration folder (default: `~/.guildbotics/config/prompts`) with the following content:

```markdown
If the following text is in ${1}, translate it to ${2}; if it is in ${2}, translate it to ${1}:
```

Notes:

- `${1}` and `${2}` are positional arguments. Values are provided at invocation time.


### 1.2. Invoke the command

Run `echo "Hello" | guildbotics run translate English Japanese` and you’ll get output like:

```
こんにちは
```

Note:
Before the LLM call, the prompt file is expanded as follows:

```
If the following text is in English, translate it to Japanese; if it is in Japanese, translate it to English:

Hello
```

This leads the LLM to respond with "こんにちは".

### 1.3. Select a member

If you have multiple members registered via `guildbotics add`, you must specify a member when running a command using the `<command>@<person_id>` form.

Example: `guildbotics run translate@yuki English Japanese`


## 2. Variations of variable expansion
In addition to positional arguments, you can use named arguments and the Jinja2 template engine. These enable more flexible prompt definitions.

### 2.1. Named arguments
Use the `${arg_name}` form to reference keyword arguments provided via `params`.

```markdown
Please translate the following text from ${source} to ${target}:
```

Invocation example:

```shell
$ echo "Hello" | guildbotics run translate source=English target=Japanese
```

### 2.2. Jinja2 examples
You can leverage Jinja2 for more complex expansion. For example, reference variables with `{{ variable_name }}`.

```markdown
---
template_engine: jinja2
---
{% if target %}
Please translate the following text into {{ target }}:
{% else %}
Please translate the following text into English:
{% endif %}
```

When using Jinja2, add YAML front matter and set `template_engine: jinja2` as above.

Note:
YAML front matter is text at the beginning of a Markdown file starting and ending with `---`.
It is optional, but required when specifying the template engine or selecting a brain (described later).

Invocation examples:

```shell
$ echo "こんにちは" | guildbotics run translate
Hello

$ echo "Hello" | guildbotics run translate target=Chinese
你好
```

### 2.3. Using the `context` variable
When using Jinja2, you can access the execution context via the `context` variable, such as current member information or team members.

```markdown
---
brain: none
template_engine: jinja2
---

Language code: {{ context.language_code }}
Language name: {{ context.language_name }}

ID: {{ context.person.person_id }}
Name: {{ context.person.name }}
Speaking style: {{ context.person.speaking_style }}

Team members:
{% for member in context.team.members %}
- {{ member.person_id }}: {{ member.name }}
{% endfor %}
```

- With `brain: none`, the LLM is not called; only subcommand outputs are used as the final result.

## 3. Using the CLI agent

Specify `brain: cli` in YAML front matter to invoke a CLI agent such as OpenAI Codex or Google Gemini CLI. With a CLI agent, you can instruct the AI to read files, run system commands, and perform more advanced operations.

For example, create a file `summarize.md` with the following content:

```markdown
---
brain: cli
---
Read the first section of ${file} and summarize it in one line using ${language}.
```

Invocation example:

```shell
$ guildbotics run summarize file=README.md language=English cwd=.
GuildBotics is an alpha tool for collaborating with AI agents and a task board; users should test in isolated environments due to potential breaking changes and risks.
```

For CLI agents, set the working directory for system commands via the `cwd` parameter.


## 4. Using built-in commands
You can use [built-in commands](../guildbotics/templates/intelligences/functions/) shipped with GuildBotics.

Invocation examples:

```shell
$ guildbotics run functions/talk_as topic="Investigating a production error and mitigation steps"
author: Yuki Nakamura
author_type: Assistant
content: Sorry — we’re seeing an error in production. I’m actively investigating the root cause and mitigation options to minimize impact. I’ll share updates and a remediation plan shortly.
```

```shell
$ echo "Hi! It's a beautiful day." | guildbotics run functions/identify_item item_type="Conversation type" candidates="Question / Chit-chat / Request"
confidence: 0.95
label: Chit-chat
reason: The user is simply greeting and making small talk, not asking a specific question or making a request.
```

```shell
$ echo "The current time is `date`." | guildbotics run functions/identify_item item_type="Time of day" candidates="Early morning, Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Evening, Night, Late night"
confidence: 1.0
label: Late night
reason: The current time is 23:36, which falls in the late night period (typically 11pm–3am).
```

## 5. Using subcommands
You can chain multiple subcommands to build a workflow.

For example, create `get-time-of-day.md` as follows:

```markdown
---
commands:
  - script: echo "The current time is `date`."
  - command: functions/identify_item item_type="Time of day" candidates="Early morning, Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Evening, Night, Late night"
  - prompt: Please provide a suitable greeting for the current time of day.
---
```

```shell
$ guildbotics run get-time-of-day
Good evening.
```

List the commands to run in order under the `commands` array. Each command receives the previous command’s output as input.

- `script`: write a shell script inline
- `command`: invoke another prompt file or a built-in command
- `prompt`: call an LLM with a prompt written in Markdown

### 5.1. Naming subcommands and referencing outputs

You can set a `name` for each entry in `commands`:

```markdown
---
commands:
  - name: current_time
    script: echo "The current time is `date`."
  - name: time_of_day
    command: functions/identify_item item_type="Time of day" candidates="Morning, Afternoon, Night"
---
```

When `name` is set, you can reference that command’s output by the given name.

```markdown
---
commands:
  - name: current_time
    script: echo "The current time is `date +%T`."
  - name: time_of_day
    command: functions/identify_item item_type="Time of day" candidates="Morning, Afternoon, Night"
brain: none
template_engine: jinja2
---
{% if time_of_day.label == "Morning" %}
Good morning.
{% elif time_of_day.label == "Night" %}
Good evening.
{% else %}
Hello.
{% endif %}

{{ current_time }}
```

Running the above returns something like:

```text
Good evening.

The current time is 20:17:15.
```

- With `brain: none`, the LLM is not called; only subcommand outputs are used as the final result.
- With `template_engine: jinja2`, the Jinja2 template engine is enabled. It is recommended when referencing command outputs.

### 5.2. Schema definition
For `prompt` commands that call an LLM, you can define the response schema with `schema` and specify the response class with `response_class`. This allows you to handle the LLM response as structured data.

```markdown
---
schema: |
    class Ranking:
        package: str
        detail: str
        line_rate: float
        reason: str

    class Rankings:
        items: list[Ranking]

    class Task:
        title: str
        description: str
        priority: int

    class TaskList:
        tasks: list[Task]
commands:
  - script: |
      pytest tests/ --cov=guildbotics --cov-report=xml >/dev/null 2>&1
      cat coverage.xml |grep line-rate
  - prompt: |
      This information is analyzed to output the top 3 packages with the highest priority for test implementation in JSON format as Rankings.
    response_class: Rankings
  - name: task_list
    prompt: |
      Based on this analysis, please propose up to 5 immediately actionable test implementation tasks in JSON format as TaskList, sorted by priority.
    response_class: TaskList
template_engine: jinja2
brain: none
---
{% for task in task_list.tasks %}
- [ ] {{ task.title }} (priority: {{ task.priority }})
{% endfor %}
```

Invocation example:

```shell
$ guildbotics run coverage
- [ ] Add unit tests for utils/fileio.py (priority: 1)
- [ ] Add tests for utils/git_tool.py's operations and error handling (priority: 2)
- [ ] Add integrated unit tests for drivers/custom_command_runner.py and drivers/task_scheduler.py (priority: 3)
- [ ] Add tests for utils/import_utils.py's import processing and edge cases (priority: 4)
- [ ] Add business logic and external call mock tests for intelligences/functions.py (priority: 5)
```

### 5.3. Print command

`print` is a command for generating and formatting text without calling the LLM. It is described directly in place as the value of the `print` key in the `commands` array.

```markdown
---
commands:
  - print: Hello.
---
```
Invocation example:

```shell
$ guildbotics run greet
Hello.
```

In the print command, the Jinja2 template engine is enabled, so you can also use variable expansion and conditional branching.

```markdown
---
commands:
  - name: current_time
    script: echo "The current time is `date +%T`."
  - name: time_of_day
    command: functions/identify_item item_type="Time of day" candidates="Morning, Afternoon, Night"
  - print: |
      {% if time_of_day.label == "Morning" %}
      Good morning.
      {% elif time_of_day.label == "Night" %}
      Good evening.
      {% else %}
      Hello.
      {% endif %}

      {{ current_time }}
---
```
Running the above returns something like:

```text
Good evening.

The current time is 20:17:15.
```


## 6. Using shell scripts
In addition to writing inline under the `script` key as above, you can also implement an external shell script and invoke it as a command.

For example, create `current-time.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "The current time is `date +%T`."
```

After making the file executable, use the `command` key instead of `script` in your prompt file:

```markdown
---
commands:
  - name: current_time
    command: current-time
  - name: time_of_day
    command: functions/identify_item item_type="Time of day" candidates="Morning, Afternoon, Night"
brain: none
template_engine: jinja2
---
{% if time_of_day.label == "Morning" %}
Good morning.
{% elif time_of_day.label == "Night" %}
Good evening.
{% else %}
Hello.
{% endif %}

{{ current_time }}
```

Handling arguments in shell commands:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "arg1: ${1}"
echo "arg2: ${2}"
echo "key1: ${key1}"
echo "key2: ${key2}"
```

Invocation example:

```shell
$ guildbotics run echo-args a b key1=c key2=d
arg1: a
arg2: b
key1: c
key2: d
```


## 7. Using Python commands
With Python files, you can call APIs and embed complex logic.

For example, create `hello.py` with:

```python
def main():
    return "Hello, world!"
```

- Define the entry point as a function named `main`.

Invoke it like Markdown-based commands:

```shell
$ guildbotics run hello
Hello, world!
```

### 7.1. Using arguments

Python commands support three types of arguments:

- context: If the first parameter of `main` is named `context` / `ctx` / `c`, you can access the execution context. Typical use cases:
  - Retrieve team and person information
  - Invoke other commands
  - Access ticket management services or code hosting services
- positional arguments: Define as positional parameters of `main`.
- keyword arguments: Define as keyword parameters of `main`.

```python
from guildbotics.runtime.context import Context

def main(context: Context, arg1, arg2, key1=None, key2=None):
    print(f"arg1: {arg1}")
    print(f"arg2: {arg2}")
    print(f"key1: {key1}")
    print(f"key2: {key2}")
```

Invocation example:

```shell
$ guildbotics run hello a b key1=c key2=d
arg1: a
arg2: b
key1: c
key2: d
```

```python
from guildbotics.runtime.context import Context

def main(context: Context, *args, **kwargs):
    for i, arg in enumerate(args):
        print(f"arg[{i}]: {arg}")

    for k, v in kwargs.items():
        print(f"kwarg[{k}]: {v}")
```

Invocation example:

```shell
$ guildbotics run hello a b key1=c key2=d
arg[0]: a
arg[1]: b
kwarg[key1]: c
kwarg[key2]: d
```

### 7.2. Invoking other commands
From a Python command, you can call another command with `context.invoke`.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from guildbotics.runtime.context import Context


async def main(context: Context):
    current_time = f"The current time is {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M')}."

    time_of_day = await context.invoke(
        "functions/identify_item",
        message=current_time,
        item_type="Time of day",
        candidates="Morning, Afternoon, Night",
    )

    message = ""
    if time_of_day.label == "Morning":
        message = "Good morning."
    elif time_of_day.label == "Night":
        message = "Good evening."
    else:
        message = "Hello."

    return f"{message}\n{current_time}"
```

- Because `invoke` is asynchronous, call it with `await`. Therefore, define `main` as `async def`.
