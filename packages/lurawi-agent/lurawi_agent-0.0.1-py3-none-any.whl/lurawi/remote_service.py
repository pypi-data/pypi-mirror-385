"""
Remote Service Module for the Lurawi System.

This module provides a base class for implementing remote services that can be
started, stopped, and can register for timer events. Remote services inherit from
TimerClient to receive timer notifications.

Remote services are used to interact with external systems or perform periodic
tasks within the Lurawi system.
