"""
Timer Management Module for the Lurawi System.

This module provides classes for creating and managing timers in an asynchronous environment.
It enables scheduling of timed events with configurable intervals and repetitions.

The module includes:
- TimerClient: Base class for objects that want to receive timer events
- TimerManager: Central manager for creating and tracking timers
- BotTimer: Individual timer implementation

The module creates a global TimerManager instance (timerManager) that can be imported
and used throughout the application.
