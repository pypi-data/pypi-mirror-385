"""
Custom behaviour for retrieving a value from a dictionary (store) by its key.

This module defines the `get_keyvalue` class, which allows the system to
access an element within a dictionary (stored in the knowledge base or
directly provided) using a specified key and then store the retrieved value
under a new knowledge base key.

class get_keyvalue(CustomBehaviour):
    """!@brief Retrieves a value from a dictionary (store) using a specified key.

    This custom behaviour fetches a value from a dictionary-like structure.
    The 'store' can be a knowledge base key pointing to a dictionary, or if
    omitted, the main knowledge base itself is used as the store. The 'key'
    can also be resolved from the knowledge base. The retrieved value is then
    stored in the knowledge base under a designated output key.

    Args:
        store (str, optional): The knowledge base key pointing to the dictionary
                               from which to retrieve the value. If not provided,
                               the main knowledge base (`self.kb`) is used as the store.
        key (str): The key whose associated value is to be retrieved from the store.
                   If a knowledge base key, its value is used as the actual key.
        value (str, optional): The knowledge base key under which the retrieved
                               value will be stored. Defaults to "_VALUE_OUTPUT"
                               if not provided.
        success_action (list, optional): An action to execute if the value is
                                         successfully retrieved (e.g., `["play_behaviour", "2"]`).
        failed_action (list, optional): An action to execute if the retrieval
                                        fails (e.g., `["play_behaviour", "next"]`).

    Example: Retrieve 'team' from 'QUERY_OUTPUT' and store it as 'KNOWN_TEAM':
    ["custom", { "name": "get_keyvalue",
                 "args": {
                            "store": "QUERY_OUTPUT",
                            "key" : "team",
                            "value": "KNOWN_TEAM",
                            "success_action": ["play_behaviour", "2"],
                            "failed_action": ["play_behaviour", "next"]
