class behaviour_router(CustomBehaviour):
    """!@brief Dynamically routes and plays a selected behaviour.

    This custom behaviour enables the dynamic selection and execution of
    other behaviours within the system. It supports random selection from
    all active behaviours or from a predefined, restricted list of behaviours.

    Args:
        select (str): Specifies the selection method. Can be "random" to pick
                      a behaviour randomly, or the exact name of a behaviour
                      to play. If a knowledge base key, its value is used.
        behaviours (list, optional): A list of behaviour names (strings) to
                                     restrict the selection. If provided,
                                     selection will only occur from this list.
                                     Can also be a knowledge base key whose
                                     value is a list.
        restricted (bool, optional): If `True` and `behaviours` is provided,
                                     the `select` argument must be one of the
                                     behaviours in the `behaviours` list.
                                     Defaults to `False`.
        failed_action (list, optional): An action to execute if the behaviour
                                        fails (e.g., `["play_behaviour", "next"]`).

    Example: Randomly select from a restricted list:
    ["custom", { "name": "behaviour_router",
                 "args": {
                            "select": "random",
                            "behaviours": ["story1", "story2", "story3"],
                            "restricted": True,
                            "failed_action": ["play_behaviour", "next"]
                         }
