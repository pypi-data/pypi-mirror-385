    """Interface for unified storage management combining metadata and resource data.

    This interface provides a high-level abstraction that combines both metadata
    storage (IMetaStore) and resource data storage (IResourceStore) into a single
    unified interface. It serves as the primary storage abstraction for the
    ResourceManager and handles the coordination between metadata and data storage.

    The storage interface manages the complete lifecycle of resources including:
    - Resource and revision existence checking
    - Metadata and data storage coordination
    - Search and query operations across metadata
    - Bulk data export and import operations
    - Data encoding and serialization

    Type Parameters:
        T: The type of data stored in resources. This ensures type safety
           for resource data operations throughout the storage layer.

    This interface is typically implemented by storage systems that coordinate
    between separate metadata and resource stores, providing a unified view
    while optimizing for different access patterns and performance requirements.

        This method checks for resource existence at the metadata level. A resource
        is considered to exist if it has associated metadata, regardless of its
        deletion status or the number of revisions it has.

        This is a lightweight operation that only checks metadata presence and
