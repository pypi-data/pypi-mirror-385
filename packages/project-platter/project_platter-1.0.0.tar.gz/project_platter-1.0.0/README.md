## 🚀 Overview

**Project Platter** is an open-source Python automation framework by **Hamza-Ghaffar**, built to streamline the setup and management of automation, agentic, and AI-based projects.

It’s a **plug-and-play project scaffolding system** designed for engineers, researchers, and developers who want to:

- ⚙️ Quickly bootstrap new Python or AI agent projects  
- 🧱 Maintain clean, consistent project structures  
- 🔗 Integrate GitHub repositories, CI/CD, and RAG workflows  
- 🤖 Extend automation using LangChain, OpenAI, or custom pipelines  
- 📈 Scale with reusable templates and automation commands  

Project Platter follows the same documentation and distribution standards as top-tier open-source libraries like **React**, **FastAPI**, and **LangChain**.
