    A reentrant lock that guarantees FIFO (first-in-first-out) access ordering.

    Unlike Python's standard RLock, this lock ensures that threads acquire
    the lock in the exact order they requested it, providing fairness and
    preventing lock starvation.

    Features:
    - Reentrant: Same thread can acquire multiple times
    - FIFO ordering: Threads get lock in request order
    - Context manager support: Use with 'with' statement
    - Thread-safe: Safe for concurrent access
