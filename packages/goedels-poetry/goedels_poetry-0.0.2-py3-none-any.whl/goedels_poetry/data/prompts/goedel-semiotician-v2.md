You will receive a math problem consisting of its natural language statement along with its formal statement in LEAN 4.

Please evaluate whether the formal LEAN statement appropriately translates the natural language statement based on the following criteria:

1. Key Elements: The problem's essential components are correctly represented in LEAN code.
2. Mathematical Accuracy: The translation preserves the accuracy of the mathematical content.
3. Structural Fidelity: The translation aligns closely with the original problem, maintaining its structure and purpose.
4. Comprehensiveness: All assumptions, conditions, and goals present in the natural language statement are included in the LEAN translation.

Your answer should be in the following format:

Thought: [Your Answer]

Judgement: [Your Answer, one of {Appropriate, Inappropriate}]

Following are the example problems label for the reasonability of their translation.

# Example 1:

## Original natural language statement of the problem:

For the graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, the vertex of the parabola is $(2,10)$, and one of the $x$-intercepts is $(1,0)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the other $x$-intercept?

## Translated formal statement:
```lean
theorem quadratic_other_intercept
    (f : $\mathbb{R}$ → $\mathbb{R}$)
    (a b c : $\mathbb{R}$)
    (h_quad : ∀ x, f x = a * x^2 + b * x + c)
    (h_vertex : f 2 = 10 ∧ ∀ x, f x ≤ f 2)  -- vertex at (2,10)
    (h_intercept1 : f 1 = 0) :               -- x-intercept at (1,0)
    f 3 = 0 := by                            -- other x-intercept at (3,0)
```

Thought: The Lean translation of the problem is appropriate because it accurately captures the intent and reasoning of the original problem. The problem's key elements, such as the vertex, axis of symmetry, and x-intercepts of the quadratic function, are correctly translated into Lean code. The logical flow of the proof mirrors the original reasoning, starting with the symmetry property of the quadratic function and using it to determine the second x-intercept. The mathematical accuracy is preserved, as the proof correctly applies the vertex property and symmetry to arrive at the solution. Furthermore, the translation aligns well with the original problem in natural language, maintaining fidelity to its structure and purpose. Overall, the translation is both faithful and complete, making it an appropriate representation of the original problem.

Judgement: Appropriate

# Example 2:

## Original natural language statement of the problem:

Draw a tangent line from the point $(4, 3)$ to the circle $(x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$. What is the equation of the line that passes through the two tangent points?

## Translated formal statement:
```lean
theorem tangent_line_equation (x y : $\mathbb{R}$) :
  let P : $\mathbb{R}$ × $\mathbb{R}$ := (4, 3)  -- Point P
  let C : $\mathbb{R}$ × $\mathbb{R}$ := (2, 1)  -- Center of first circle
  let r : $\mathbb{R}$ := 1          -- Radius of first circle
  -- Points (x,y) satisfying both circle equations
  let on_first_circle := (x - 2)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 1
  let on_second_circle := (x - 3)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 2
  -- If point is on both circles
  on_first_circle ∧ on_second_circle →
  -- Then it lies on the line 2x + 2y - 7 = 0
  2*x + 2*y - 7 = 0 := by
```

Thought: The Lean translation of the problem is inappropriate because it fundamentally changes the intent of the original problem. The original problem asks to derive the equation of the tangent line passing through the intersection points of two circles, but the translation assumes the equation (2x + 2y - 7 = 0) is already given and instead asks to prove that the intersection points lie on this line. This shifts the problem from a construction task to a verification task, losing the original problem's focus on deriving the result through geometric and algebraic reasoning. Additionally, the translation omits the key reasoning step of subtracting the circle equations to derive the line equation, which is central to the original problem. As a result, the translation fails to accurately represent the problem's intent and educational value, making it an incomplete and inappropriate representation.

Judgement: Inappropriate


Example3:

## Original natural language statement of the problem:

If $a,b,c,d > 0$ and $abcd = 1$ , prove that \n\n $ \frac{1}{a+b+c +1}+ \frac{1}{b+c+d+1}+\frac{1}{c+d+a+1}+\frac{1}{d+a+b+1} \le\frac{1}{a+3} +\frac{1}{b+3} + \frac{1}{c+3} + \frac{1}{d+3} $\n\n -/

## Translated formal statement:
```lean4
theorem lean_workbook_49553 (a b c d : $\mathbb{R}$) (habc : a * b * c * d = 1) : (1 / (a + b + c + 1) + 1 / (b + c + d + 1) + 1 / (c + d + a + 1) + 1 / (d + a + b + 1)) ≤ (1 / (a + 3) + 1 / (b + 3) + 1 / (c + 3) + 1 / (d + 3))  :=  by sorry
```

Thought: The Lean translation of the problem is inappropriate because the condition $a,b,c,d>0$ is ignored in the formal statement.

Judgement: Inappropriate



Example4:

## Original natural language statement of the problem:

If $a=b=c=2$ so $\sum_{cyc}\frac{(a-1)^2}{a^2+2}=\frac{1}{2}$ . We'll prove that $\frac{1}{2}$ is the answer.

## Translated formal statement:
```lean4
theorem lean_workbook_plus_1478 (a b c : $\mathbb{R}$) (ha : a = 2) (hb : b = 2) (hc : c = 2) : (a - 1) ^ 2 / (a ^ 2 + 2) + (b - 1) ^ 2 / (b ^ 2 + 2) + (c - 1) ^ 2 / (c ^ 2 + 2) = 1 / 2   :=  by sorry
```

Thought: The Lean translation of the problem is appropriate because it accurately captures the assumptions and the goal in the natural language statement.
