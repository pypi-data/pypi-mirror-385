# Implementation Summary: AST Type Information Extraction

## Problem Statement

The methods `_ast_to_code()`, `_get_named_subgoal_ast()`, `_get_named_subgoal_rewritten_ast()`, and `_get_unproven_subgoal_names()` in `goedels_poetry/parsers/util.py` did not fully utilize the information available in the AST response from the Kimina server.

Specifically, when extracting named subgoals using `AST.get_named_subgoal_code()`, the generated Lean code did not include type declarations for variables, even though this information was available in the `sorries` list from check responses.

### Example

Given Lean 4 code:
```lean
theorem u31 (O A C B D : ℂ) ... := by
  have hOA_parallel_CA_or : C = A ∨ ∃ r : ℝ, O - A = r • (C - A) := by
    sorry
```

**Before this fix:**
```lean
lemma hOA_parallel_CA_or : C = A ∨ ∃ r, O - A = r • (C - A) := by sorry
```
❌ Missing type information - variables O, A, C have unknown types

**After this fix:**
```lean
lemma hOA_parallel_CA_or (O : ℂ) (A : ℂ) (C : ℂ) : C = A ∨ ∃ r : ℝ, O - A = r • (C - A) := by sorry
```
✅ Complete type information - all variables have explicit types

## Solution Overview

Enhanced the AST parser to:
1. Accept an optional `sorries` parameter containing goal context from check responses
2. Parse the `goal` field in each sorry entry to extract variable type declarations
3. Use this type information when generating subgoal code to include proper type binders

## Files Modified

### 1. `goedels_poetry/parsers/ast.py`

**Changes:**
- Modified `AST.__init__` to accept optional `sorries` parameter
- Updated `AST.get_named_subgoal_code()` to pass sorries to the rewriter

**Impact:** Backward compatible - existing code works without modification

### 2. `goedels_poetry/parsers/util.py`

**New Functions:**
- `__parse_goal_context(goal: str) -> dict[str, str]` - Parses goal strings to extract type declarations
- `__make_binder_from_type_string(name: str, type_str: str) -> dict` - Creates AST binder nodes from type strings
- `__is_referenced_in(subtree: Node, name: str) -> bool` - Checks if a variable is referenced in an AST subtree

**Modified Functions:**
- `_get_named_subgoal_rewritten_ast()` - Now accepts and uses sorries to add type information to binders

### 3. `tests/test_parsers_ast.py`

**New Tests:**
- `test_ast_init_with_sorries()` - Verifies AST initialization with sorries
- `test_ast_init_without_sorries()` - Verifies backward compatibility
- `test_ast_with_sorries_extracts_types()` - Verifies type extraction functionality

### 4. Documentation

**New Files:**
- `AST_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the enhancement
- `INTEGRATION_NOTES.md` - Guide for integrating sorries into agent workflows
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Technical Details

### Goal Context Parsing

The `__parse_goal_context()` function parses Lean goal strings of the form:

```
O A C B D : ℂ
hd₁ : ¬B = D
hd₂ : ¬C = D
hnorm : ‖O - A‖ * ‖D - B‖ = ‖A - C‖ * ‖B - O‖
⊢ goal_expression
```

It extracts:
- Simple type declarations: `O A C B D : ℂ` → `{"O": "ℂ", "A": "ℂ", ...}`
- Hypothesis types: `hd₁ : ¬B = D` → `{"hd₁": "¬B = D"}`
- Complex expressions: `hnorm : ‖O - A‖ * ...` → `{"hnorm": "‖O - A‖ * ..."}`

### Type Binder Generation

For each variable referenced in a subgoal:
1. Check if it's defined in the subgoal itself (skip if yes)
2. Check if type info is available from AST analysis
3. If not, check if type info is available from goal context (sorries)
4. Create an explicit binder: `(variable_name : type)`

### Backward Compatibility

The implementation is fully backward compatible:
- `sorries` parameter is optional (defaults to `None`)
- When no sorries provided, behavior is identical to before
- All existing tests pass without modification
- No changes required to existing code

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (No Type Information)

```python
from goedels_poetry.parsers.ast import AST

# Old way - still works
ast = AST(ast_dict)
code = ast.get_named_subgoal_code("subgoal_name")
# Result: lemma subgoal_name : expr := by sorry
```

### Enhanced Usage (With Type Information)

```python
from goedels_poetry.parsers.ast import AST

# New way - with type information
ast = AST(ast_dict, sorries)
code = ast.get_named_subgoal_code("subgoal_name")
# Result: lemma subgoal_name (var1 : type1) (var2 : type2) : expr := by sorry
```

### Complete Example with Kimina Client

```python
from kimina_client import KiminaClient
from goedels_poetry.parsers.ast import AST

kimina_client = KiminaClient(api_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Get AST structure
ast_response = kimina_client.ast_code(lean_code)
ast_dict = ast_response.results[0].ast

# Get sorries with goal context
check_response = kimina_client.check(lean_code)
sorries = check_response.results[0].response.get("sorries", [])

# Create AST with type information
ast = AST(ast_dict, sorries)

# Extract subgoal with complete types
subgoal_code = ast.get_named_subgoal_code("hOA_parallel_CA_or")
print(subgoal_code)
# Output: lemma hOA_parallel_CA_or (O : ℂ) (A : ℂ) (C : ℂ) : C = A ∨ ... := by sorry
```

## Testing

# Run all parser tests
uv run pytest tests/test_parsers_ast.py tests/test_parsers_util.py -v

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_parsers_ast.py::test_ast_with_sorries_extracts_types -v
```

### Test Coverage

## Benefits

1. **Complete Lemmas**: Generated subgoals are now self-contained with all type information
2. **Standalone Compilation**: Extracted subgoals can be compiled independently
3. **Better Type Safety**: Explicit type declarations prevent ambiguity
4. **Improved Debugging**: Clear types make it easier to understand and fix subgoals
5. **Enhanced Automation**: Tools can better analyze and manipulate typed code
6. **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing code

## Future Enhancements

See `INTEGRATION_NOTES.md` for potential improvements:

1. **Automatic Sorries in Agents**: Modify parser agents to automatically include sorries from checker agents
2. **Better Sorry Matching**: Match sorries to specific subgoals by line/column position
3. **Type Inference**: Use sorries to infer types even for variables not explicitly in scope
4. **Cross-Reference Detection**: Identify when subgoals reference each other

## Validation

### Manual Testing

The implementation was validated with:
1. Real theorem proof sketch from user's example (theorem u31)
2. Multiple test cases with various type complexities
3. Edge cases (empty goals, no sorries, complex types)

### Automated Testing

All tests pass:
- Unit tests for AST class
- Unit tests for util functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Regression tests for backward compatibility

## Performance Impact

- **No measurable performance impact**: Parsing goal context is O(n) where n = number of lines in goal
- **Memory overhead**: Minimal - stores list of sorries (typically small)
- **Computation**: Only when `get_named_subgoal_code()` is called with sorries

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses the problem by:
- Extracting type information from sorries
- Incorporating types into generated subgoal code
- Maintaining full backward compatibility
- Providing clear documentation and examples

The enhancement enables better automation and makes extracted subgoals more useful for both human review and automated processing.
