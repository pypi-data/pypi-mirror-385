# Verification: AST Changes Compatible with GoedelsPoetryStateManager

## Summary

✅ **VERIFIED**: All AST parser enhancements are fully compatible with `GoedelsPoetryStateManager.reconstruct_complete_proof()`.

## Test Results

### Parser Tests
- **28/28 tests passing** - All AST and parser utility tests pass
- Tests cover type extraction, backward compatibility, and new functionality

### State Manager Tests
- **35/35 tests passing** - All state management and proof reconstruction tests pass
- Includes specific test for AST behavior: `test_reconstruct_complete_proof_with_dependencies_in_signature`

### Code Quality
- **`make check` passes** - All linting, formatting, and type checking passes
- No warnings or errors

## How Compatibility is Maintained

The `reconstruct_complete_proof()` method is **already designed** to handle AST's behavior of adding dependencies as parameters (see lines 1273-1282 in `goedels_poetry/state.py`):

```python
"""
Important: The child's formal_theorem may differ from what appears in the parent sketch
because AST.get_named_subgoal_code() adds earlier dependencies as explicit parameters.
For example:
  - Parent sketch has: "have sum_not_3 : ... := by sorry"
  - Child formal_theorem: "lemma sum_not_3 (cube_mod9 : ...) : ... := by ..."

We handle this by:
  1. Extracting just the name from the child (e.g., "sum_not_3")
  2. Searching for that name in the parent sketch (which has the original signature)
  3. Replacing the sorry in the parent's original have statement
"""
```

### The Algorithm

1. **Name Extraction**: `_extract_have_name()` extracts only the lemma/have name, ignoring any added parameters
2. **Pattern Matching**: Searches for the name in parent sketch using the original signature
3. **Proof Inlining**: Replaces just the `sorry` in the parent's original statement

This design means the enhanced AST that now includes **proper type information** for dependencies works seamlessly with the existing reconstruction logic.

## What Changed in AST

### Before
```lean
lemma hOA_parallel_CA_or : C = A ∨ ∃ r, O - A = r • (C - A) := by sorry
```
❌ Missing type information

### After (with sorries)
```lean
lemma hOA_parallel_CA_or
  (O : ℂ)
  (A : ℂ)
  (C : ℂ)
  (hOAcol : ((O - A) / (C - A)).im = 0)
  : C = A ∨ ∃ r : ℝ, O - A = r • (C - A) := by sorry
```
✅ Complete type information for both variables AND hypotheses

### Impact on Reconstruction

**None!** The reconstruction method:
- Extracts just the name `hOA_parallel_CA_or`
- Finds it in the parent sketch: `have hOA_parallel_CA_or : ... := by sorry`
- Replaces the `sorry` with the child's proof tactics
- Result has the **original** parent signature, not the child's enhanced one

## Key Test Case

The test `test_reconstruct_complete_proof_with_dependencies_in_signature` explicitly verifies this scenario:

```python
# Parent sketch (original):
sketch = """theorem test_deps := by
  have cube_mod9 : ∀ (a : ℤ), (a^3) % 9 ∈ {0, 1, 8} := by sorry
  have sum_not_3 : ∀ (s1 s2 : ℤ), ... := by sorry
  sorry"""

# Child with dependency added (as AST does):
child2 = FormalTheoremProofState(
    formal_theorem="lemma sum_not_3 (cube_mod9 : ∀ (a : ℤ), (a^3) % 9 ∈ {0, 1, 8}) : ...",
    formal_proof="lemma sum_not_3 (cube_mod9 : ...) : ... := by\n  intro s1 s2\n  omega",
)

# Result: Correctly matches by name and replaces sorry
# ✅ Test passes!
```

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are **100% backward compatible**:

1. **Optional Parameter**: `sorries` is optional in `AST.__init__()`
2. **Graceful Fallback**: Without sorries, behavior is identical to before
3. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing code works without modification
4. **Existing Tests Pass**: All 28 parser tests + 35 state tests pass

## Conclusion

The AST enhancements to extract type information from sorries are:

✅ **Fully functional** - Extracts complete type information
✅ **Well tested** - 28 parser tests + 35 state tests passing
✅ **Backward compatible** - Works with or without sorries
✅ **Compatible with reconstruction** - Designed to work together
✅ **Code quality verified** - Passes all linting and type checks

The enhanced AST provides richer type information while remaining fully compatible with the existing proof reconstruction infrastructure.
