The previous proof sketch (Round {{ prev_round_num }}) was syntactically valid, but the decomposed subgoals could not be proven after multiple attempts. This suggests that the decomposition strategy itself may not be the right approach for this theorem.

Please try a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT decomposition strategy. Consider:
- A different proof technique (e.g., if the previous attempt used induction, try direct proof, contradiction, or case analysis)
- A different way to break down the problem into subgoals
- Different intermediate lemmas that might be easier to prove
- A simpler or more direct path to the conclusion

Before producing the new Lean 4 code to sketch a proof, provide:
1. A brief analysis of why the previous decomposition might have been too difficult
2. A description of the new strategy you will try
3. An explanation of how this new approach differs from the previous one
