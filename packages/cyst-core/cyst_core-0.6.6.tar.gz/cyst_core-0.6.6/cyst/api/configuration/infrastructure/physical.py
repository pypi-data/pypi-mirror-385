    Physical connection represents traversing between two locations. This can be anything from going through a door
    frame to boarding an intercontinental flight. Physical connections do not have access control, i.e., any user can
    attempt to cross the divide between two locations, but if they are denied access at the destination, it is assumed
    that the user will have to return back effectively wasting twice the time without accomplishing nothing.

    Physical connections are bidirectional, so there is no real difference between the origin and destination.

    locations is currently not considered.
