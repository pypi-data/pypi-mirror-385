    Platform interface provides an abstraction layer for different execution environments, e.g., simulation or
    emulation. When creating a new Environment a platform is instantiated and from then it takes care of message
    delivery and infrastructure configuration. As such, it is closely related to behavioral models, whose actions are
    custom tailored for a given platform.

        Initialize platform. After this call, the platform should correctly process all calls. The platform need not
        check whether the init was called, the core will execute it exactly once before calling anything else.

        Error should be communicated via the logging interface.

        The configuration interface for the entire platform. In essence, platforms may implement up-to the extent of
        CYST simulation. But it is generally understood that the configuration options for, e.g., emulation platforms
        will be much more limited and will not enable all on-the-fly modifications.

        * ActionConfiguration: the one provided by the core can be used
        * ExploitConfiguration: the one provided by the core can be used
        * GeneralConfiguration:

          * :func:`get_configuration`, :func:`save_configuration`, :func:`load_configuration`, and
            :func:`get_configuration_by_id` should be proxied back to the core. :func:`get_object_by_id` must be
