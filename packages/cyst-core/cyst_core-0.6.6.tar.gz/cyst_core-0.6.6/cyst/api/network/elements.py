    A route specifies which port should the traffic to specific network be routed through. Many routes can be specified
    for a node. If there is an overlap in network specification, than the resulting port is selected according to the
    route metrics (i.e., the lower the metric the higher the chance to be selected as the route). In case of a metric
    equality, the most specific network is selected.
