class ScatteringMatrix:
    """Stores the scattering matrix for a stack of layers.

    The first layer in a stack is the "start" layer, and the last layer in the
    stack is the "end" layer.

    The scattering matrix relates the forward-going and backward-going waves
    on the two sides of a layer stack, which are labeled ``a`` and ``b`` respectively.

    Note that forward going fields are defined at the *start* of a layer while
    backward-going fields are defined at the *end* of a layer, as depicted below.
    This is discussed near equation 4.1 in [1999 Whittaker].

    information about the start and end layers, which are needed to extend the
    scattering matrix to include more layers.
