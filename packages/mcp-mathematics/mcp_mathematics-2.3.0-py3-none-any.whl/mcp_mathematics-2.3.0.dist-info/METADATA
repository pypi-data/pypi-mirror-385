## Enterprise Architecture & Security

MCP Mathematics is built as an enterprise-grade mathematical computation platform that combines strong security measures with production-ready architecture. The system is designed to handle mission-critical calculations while maintaining the highest standards of code quality and security.

### Multi-Layered Security Framework

#### Core Security Principles

- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Every input is checked and every operation is verified
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers give you complete protection
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only essential operations are allowed
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Safe defaults stop accidental security issues

#### Security Implementation

- **AST Evaluation Engine**: Every mathematical expression is processed through an Abstract Syntax Tree before evaluation, which stops code injection attacks while keeping full mathematical capability
- **Operation Whitelisting**: Only specifically approved mathematical operations and functions can run, which stops unauthorized code execution
- **Input Sanitization**: Thorough checking of all expressions and parameters before processing
- **Error Containment**: Complete error handling makes sure calculation failures don't affect system security
- **Dependency Minimization**: Core features need no external libraries, which greatly reduces security risks

### Production-Grade Architecture

#### Code Quality Standards

- **Type Safety**: Complete type annotations using Python 3.10+ features make sure you catch errors at compile-time
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns makes maintenance and scaling easier
- **Professional Codebase**: Production-ready code with no debug statements, console logs, or unnecessary comments
- **Complete Testing**: 130 unit tests give you thorough coverage across all mathematical functions and edge cases
- **Automated Quality**: Code standards enforced through Black formatting and Ruff linting

#### Performance & Reliability

- **Optimized Computation**: Efficient algorithms and data structures for high-performance calculations
- **Advanced Memory Management**: Bounded LRU and TTL cache systems with automatic cleanup stop memory leaks in long-running processes
- **Thread-Safe Concurrency**: 100% reliable concurrent execution using Timer-based timeouts instead of signal-based approaches
- **Session Management**: Graceful resource cleanup and session handling for enterprise environments
- **Error Recovery**: Proper exception chaining with better traceability for debugging and monitoring
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed to handle high-volume calculation workloads with concurrent processing

## Development Guide

This complete guide gives you everything you need to contribute to MCP Mathematics, from setting up your development environment to building production-ready distributions. The project follows strict quality standards and automated workflows to make sure everything works reliably and stays maintainable.

### Development Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
python --version # Should be 3.10 or higher

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SHSharkar/MCP-Mathematics.git
cd MCP-Mathematics

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Quality Assurance Workflow

#### Running the Complete Test Suite

Run the comprehensive test suite covering all 130 test cases:

```bash
# Run all tests with detailed output
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage reporting
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_calculator.py -v      # Core functionality
python -m pytest tests/test_unit_conversion.py -v # Unit conversions
python -m pytest tests/test_financial.py -v       # Financial calculations
```

#### Code Quality and Standards

Keep professional code standards with automated quality tools:

```bash
# Auto-format code with Black (100-character line limit)
black src/ tests/ --line-length 100

# Comprehensive linting with Ruff
ruff check src/ tests/ --fix

# Type checking with mypy
mypy src/

# Run complete pre-commit validation
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Performance and Security Validation

```bash
# Security analysis
bandit -r src/

# Performance profiling for mathematical operations
python -m cProfile -s cumtime scripts/benchmark.py

# Memory usage analysis
python -m memory_profiler scripts/memory_test.py
```

### Distribution and Deployment

#### Building Production Packages

Create optimized distribution packages for PyPI:

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/

# Build source and wheel distributions
python -m build

# Verify package integrity
twine check dist/*

# Test installation in clean environment
pip install dist/*.whl
```

#### Release Management

```bash
# Tag release version
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Push tags to trigger CI/CD
git push origin --tags

# Upload to PyPI (maintainers only)
twine upload dist/*
```

## Error Handling

MCP Mathematics gives you clear, helpful error messages to help you figure out what went wrong:

- **Syntax Errors**: Clear identification of malformed expressions
- **Division by Zero**: Smooth handling of mathematical impossibilities
- **Invalid Functions**: Helpful messages when unknown functions are called
- **Type Errors**: Detailed information about incompatible operations
- **Empty Expressions**: Helpful feedback when input is missing

## System Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- MCP SDK 1.4.1 or later
