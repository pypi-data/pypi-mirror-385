Changes
=======

0.2.5 (2025-10-18)
------------------

* **Fix**: Resolved an import error with `numpy`, `pyproj`, `shapely`, `requests`, `rasterio` and `pystac-client` modules.


0.2.2 (2025-10-15)
------------------

* **Fix**: Fixed a bug in the ``mosaic`` function, now it generates both single-date mosaics and data cubes correctly.


0.2.0 (2025-10-10)
------------------

* **Multi-band Support**: It is now possible to create an mosaic with more than one band.
* **Refactored Library Code**: Adjusted imports and the use of libraries in the code, removing imports of individual functions.
* **New Notebooks**: Added several example notebooks:
    * ``smosaic-introduction.ipynb``: A complete example of creating a Sentinel-2 multi-band mosaic for Luis Eduardo Magalhaes - BA.
    * ``smosaic-data-cube.ipynb``: A complete example of creating a Sentinel-2 10 days data cube for a given bbox.
* **Data Cube Support**:  Added support for data cube generation using ``end_year``, ``end_month``, ``end_day`` and ``duration_days`` parameters.
* **Refactor filter_scenes Function**: Completely refactored ``filter_scenes`` function now use the grid geometry instead of the colleciton.json file.
- **Implemented parallel processing**: to significantly speed up mosaic generation by processing multiple time steps concurrently.‚ú®


Version 0.0.1 (2025-06-04)
------------------

* **Initial Release**: First implementation of ``mosaic`` function, with ``collection_get_data``, ``get_dataset_extents``, ``merge_tifs`` and ``clip_raster`` functions.
* Completed the smosaic exemple notebook.
* **Sentinel 2**: Added full support for Sentinel 2 data.  üõ∞Ô∏è
