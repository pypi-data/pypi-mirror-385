Pigreads stands for **Python-integrated GPU-enabled reaction-diffusion solver**.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Pigreads uses OpenCL for calculations on the graphics cards. OpenCL is usually
included in the drivers for your graphics card.

The following pages may help installing and accessing OpenCL:

- [ArchWiki: OpenCL on Arch Linux][guide-arch]
- [OpenCL-Guide: OpenCL on Ubuntu Linux][guide-ubuntu]
- [OpenCL-Guide: OpenCL on Windows][guide-windows]
- [Documentation of PyOpenCL][pyopencl].

You can use [`clinfo`][clinfo] to verify you have an OpenCL platform installed.

If instead of the GPU, you want to use CPUs, you can [install PoCL][pocl] as an
OpenCL platform to compute on the main processors.

### Installation

Install this Python package in the standard way using `pip`, for instance from
[PyPI][pypi-link] or from a local copy of this repository, see [the Python
documentation for details][py-install]. To also install the optional
dependencies, for instance for the command line interface (CLI), install the
optional dependencies `all`:

```
$ pip install pigreads[all] # from PyPI
$ pip install .[all] # from source
```

Note: If installing from source, you need to run `python prepare.py` first to
render the code templates for the models that are defined as YAML in the
`models` folder, and other preparation.

### Usage

Simulations can be performed via calls to the Python module (API) or using the
CLI. See the API and CLI sections in the [documentation for annotated
examples][rtd-link], or the examples directory in the [Pigreads
repository][repo].
