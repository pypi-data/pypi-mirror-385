    def set_fire(self, firepower: float) -> bool:
        """
        Sets the gun to fire in the direction that the gun is pointing with the specified firepower.

        Firepower is the amount of energy your bot will spend on firing the gun. This means that the
        bot will lose power on firing the gun, where the energy loss is equal to the firepower. You
        cannot spend more energy than is available from your bot.

        The bullet power must be greater than the minimum firepower and gun heat must be zero
        before the gun can fire.

        If the bullet hits an opponent bot, you will gain energy from the bullet hit.
        When hitting another bot, your bot will be rewarded and retrieve an energy boost of 3x
        the firepower.

        The gun will only fire when the firepower is at or above the minimum firepower. If the firepower
        is greater than the maximum firepower, the power will be truncated to the maximum firepower.

        Whenever the gun is fired, the gun becomes heated and needs to cool down before it can fire
        again. The gun heat must be zero before the gun can fire again. The gun heat generated by firing
        the gun is calculated as 1 + (firepower / 5). Hence, the more firepower used, the longer it
        takes to cool down the gun. The gun cooling rate can be retrieved using the `get_gun_cooling_rate()` function.

        The amount of energy used for firing the gun is subtracted from the bot's total energy. The
        amount of damage dealt by a bullet hitting another bot is 4x firepower. If the firepower is
        greater than 1, it will deal an additional 2 x (firepower - 1) damage.

        Note that the gun will automatically keep firing each turn as soon as the gun heat reaches
        zero. It is possible to disable the gun firing by setting the firepower to zero.

        The firepower is truncated between 0 and the maximum firepower if the provided value exceeds
        this range.

        when the gun is fired, which is a very simple aiming strategy.

        When fire assistance is enabled, the gun will fire towards the center of the scanned bot
        when all these conditions are met:

        1. The gun is fired (via `set_fire` or `fire()`).

        Sets the gun to adjust for the bot's turn when setting the gun turn rate. This makes the gun behave
        as if it is turning independently of the bot's turn.

        Explanation:
        The gun is mounted on the bot's body. Normally, if the bot turns 90 degrees to the right, the gun
        also turns with it since it is mounted on top of the bot's body. To compensate for this behavior,

        This allows the radar to behave as if it is turning independently of the body's turn.

        Ok, so this needs some explanation: The radar is mounted on the gun, and the gun is mounted on
        the robot's body. Normally, if the robot turns 90 degrees to the right, the gun will turn along
        with it, and so will the radar. Since the radar is mounted on top of the gun, it also follows
        the body's movement. To compensate for this, you can adjust the radar for the body turn. When this
        setting is enabled, the radar will turn independently of the body's turn.

        Notes:
            - This property is additive until you reach the maximum the radar can turn
              (`Constants.MAX_RADAR_TURN_RATE`). The "adjust" value is added to the body's turn rate, and
              the total is capped by the game's physics.

        Sets the radar to adjust for the gun's turn when setting the radar turn rate.
        This makes the radar behave as if it is turning independently of the gun's turn.

        Explanation:
        The radar is mounted on the gun. By default, if the gun turns 90 degrees to the
        right, the radar turns along with it because it is mounted on top of the gun.
        To counteract this behavior, this method allows you to adjust the radar to turn
        independently of the gun’s directional changes. When this setting is enabled
        (`adjust=True`), the radar behaves as though it is not mounted on the gun.

        Additional Details:
        - This property is additive until the radar turn rate reaches its maximum value
          (determined by `Constants.MAX_RADAR_TURN_RATE`). The adjustment amount will
          be capped by the game’s physical constraints after being combined with the
          gun's turn rate.
        - If the radar compensates in this way, it still counts as "turning the radar,"
          even when the radar is not explicitly commanded to turn.

        Notes:
        - Enabling this setting (`adjust=True`) automatically disables fire assistance.
        - Disabling this setting (`adjust=False`) automatically enables fire assistance.
        - This behavior differs from `setAdjustGunForBodyTurn` and `setAdjustRadarForBodyTurn`,
          which do not toggle fire assistance.
        - For more information on fire assistance, refer to the `setFireAssist` method.

        Normalizes an angle to a relative angle in the range [-180, 180).

        A **relative angle** represents the shortest angular distance between two directions.
        For example:
        - An angle of 190° is equivalent to -170° in relative terms, as turning -170° is
          shorter than turning 190° to reach the same direction.
        - Similarly, -190° is normalized to 170°, as turning 170° is the shorter path.

        This method ensures that any input angle is adjusted to this range, making it easier
        to work with directional calculations where relative angles are more intuitive
        (e.g., determining how much to turn to face a specific direction).
