"""Package containing asynchronous cache implementations for cloud-autopkg-runner.

This package provides various asynchronous cache implementations that can be
used with cloud-autopkg-runner to store and retrieve metadata. These caches
are designed to improve performance by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch
data from external sources.

Each cache implementation provides asynchronous methods for loading, saving,
getting, setting, and deleting cache items.
