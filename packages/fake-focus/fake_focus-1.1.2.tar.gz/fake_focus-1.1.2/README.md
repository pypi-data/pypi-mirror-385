# 💤 Fake Focus

> The ultimate productivity tool — for looking productive.

---

## 🚀 What is this?

**Fake Focus** is a *revolutionary* command-line application designed to help developers  
maintain **maximum focus** (or at least the illusion of it).

It continuously performs *extremely important background operations* like:
- Initializing neural cores  
- Optimizing dependencies  
- Synchronizing data pipelines  
- Debugging the universe  
- Asking ChatGPT for help  

All while making sure your computer — and your colleagues — believe you’re **hard at work**.

## 🧠 Why use Fake Focus?

Because sometimes, *being active* is more important than *being productive*.  
Fake Focus keeps your system alive, your Slack status green, and your conscience quiet.

Perfect for:
- Long “thinking sessions” 🧘‍♂️  
- Coffee breaks that accidentally last 2 hours ☕  
- Remote work days when “deep focus” means Netflix  
- Those times when your boss says “why are you offline?” 😬
