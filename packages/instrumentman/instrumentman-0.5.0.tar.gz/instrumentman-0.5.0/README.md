Instrumentman (or I-man for short) is a Python CLI package, that is a
collection of automated measurement programs and related utilities for
surveying instruments (mainly Leica robotic total stations).

- **Download:** https://pypi.org/project/instrumentman/
- **Documentation:** https://instrumentman.readthedocs.io/
- **Source:** https://github.com/MrClock8163/Instrumentman
- **Bug reports:** https://github.com/MrClock8163/Instrumentman/issues

## Main features

- Pure Python implementation
- Support for type checkers
- Command line applications

## Requirements

To use the package, Python 3.11 or higher is required.

I-man relies on the
[GeoComPy](https://github.com/MrClock8163/GeoComPy) package for the
implementation of the various remote command protocols.

The individual commands require a number of other packages for command line
argument parsing, JSON manipulation, calculations and other functions.

## Installation

The preferred method to install I-man is through PyPI, where both wheel
and source distributions are made available.

```shell
python -m pip install instrumentman
```

If not yet published changes/fixes are needed, that are only available in
source, I-man can also be installed locally from source, without any
external tools. Once the repository is cloned to a directory, it can be
installed with pip.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MrClock8163/Instrumentman.git
cd Instrumentman
python -m pip install .
```

Some commands require additional dependencies, that are not installed by
default with I-man. These are indicated in the documentations of the specific
commands.

## License

I-man is free and open source software, and it is distributed under the terms
of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
