# MLLM-Shap

MLLM-SHAP is a Python package designed to **interpret the predictions of large language models (LLMs) using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values**. It helps you understand the contribution of input features to model outputs, enabling transparent and explainable AI workflows.

Key features:

- Integration with audio and text models, supporting multi-modal inputs and outputs.
- Flexible aggregation strategies: mean, sum, max, min, etc.
- Multiple similarity metrics (cosine, euclidean, etc.) for embedding analysis.
- Customizable SHAP calculation algorithms: exact, Monte Carlo approximations, and more.
- Examples showcasing common explainability pipelines in examples/ on official GitHub repository.
