"""
Tools to let the assistant control a browser, including:
 - loading pages
 - reading their contents
 - searching the web
 - taking screenshots (Playwright only)

Two backends are available:

Playwright backend:
 - Full browser automation with screenshots
 - Installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pipx install 'gptme[browser]'
       # We need to use the same version of Playwright as the one installed by gptme
       # when downloading the browser binaries. gptme will attempt this automatically
       PW_VERSION=$(pipx runpip gptme show playwright | grep Version | cut -d' ' -f2)
       pipx run playwright==$PW_VERSION install chromium-headless-shell

Lynx backend:
 - Text-only browser for basic page reading and searching
 - No screenshot support
 - Installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

       # On Ubuntu
       sudo apt install lynx
       # On macOS
       brew install lynx
       # or any other way that gets you the `lynx` command

.. note::

    This is an experimental feature. It needs some work to be more robust and useful.
