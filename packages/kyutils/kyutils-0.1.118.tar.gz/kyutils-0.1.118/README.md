kyu's utils

## examples
- behavior
  - given the extracted DIO dat files from a SpikeGadgets `rec` file, plots the time course of the animal's decisions in the W-track task and indicates rewarded trials
  - plots place field
  - figures out the 2d distance by constructing a graph from trajectories
- nwb
  - basic NWB conversion of ephys data
- probe
  - `probeinterface.Probe` objects for the 15um and 20um versions of the Livermore polymer probes
- spikegadgets
  - generates a trodesconf file based on a list of Livermore probe types; e.g. if implanting three Livermore probes (one 15um type and two 20um type) in alternating order, can pass the list `[20, 15, 20]` and will generate a trodesconf file with the contacts arranged geometrically
  - generate a trodesconf file given the number of channels; good for reconfiguring
  - parses the header of a SpikeGadgets `rec` file
- spikesorting
  - plots spike waveform in probe geometry
  - computes standard metrisc for frank lab
  - generates figurl

## installation
`pip install kyutils`

for the version that creates figurls, do `pip install "kyutils[figurl]"` and set up `kachery-cloud`.
