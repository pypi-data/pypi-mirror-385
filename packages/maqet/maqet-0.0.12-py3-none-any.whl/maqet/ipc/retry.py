"""
IPC Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

Provides decorators and utilities for retrying IPC operations that may fail
due to transient network issues, temporary unavailability, or timing issues.

Features:
- Exponential backoff with configurable base delay
- Configurable max attempts
- Selective exception handling (retry only on specific exceptions)
- Debug logging for retry attempts
- Synchronous and asynchronous decorator support

    Decorator for synchronous functions with exponential backoff retry logic.
