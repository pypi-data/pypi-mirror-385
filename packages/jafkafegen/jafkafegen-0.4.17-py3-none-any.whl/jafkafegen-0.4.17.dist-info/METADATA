              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# 🥪 Jaffle Shop Generator 🏭

> [!NOTE]
> This is not an official dbt Labs project. It is maintained on a volunteer basis by dbt Labs employees who are passionate about analytics engineering, the dbt Community, and jaffles, and feel that generating datasets for learning and practicing is important. Please understand it's a work in progress and not supported in the same way as dbt itself.

The Jaffle Shop Generator or `jafgen` is a simple command line tool for generating synthetic datasets suitable for analytics engineering practice or demonstrations. The data is generated in CSV format and is designed to be used with a relational database. It follows a simple schema, with tables for:

- Customers (who place Orders)
- Orders (from those Customers)
- Products (the food and beverages the Orders contain)
- Order Items (of those Products)
- Supplies (needed for making those Products)
- Stores (where the Orders are placed and fulfilled)
- Tweets (Customers sometimes issue Tweets after placing an Order)

It uses some straightforward math to create seasonality and trends in the data, for instance weekends being less busy than weekdays, customers having certain preferences, and new store locations opening over time. We plan to add more data types and complexity as the codebase evolves.

## Installation

_Requires Python 3.10 or higher_.

If you have [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/) installed, `jafgen` is an ideal tool to use via pipx. You can generate data without installing anything in the local workspace using the following:

```shell
pipx run jafgen [options]
```

You can also install `jafgen` into your project or workspace, ideally in a virtual environment.

```shell
pip install jafgen
```

## Use

`jafgen` takes one argument:

- `[int]` Years to generate data for. The default is 1 year.

The following options are available:

- `--days [int]` The number of days to generate data for. If both years and days are set, they will be added together.

- `--pre` sets a prefix for the generated files in the format `[prefix]_[file_name].csv`. It defaults to `raw`.

Generate a simulation spanning 3 years from 2016-2019 with a prefix of `cool`:

```shell
jafgen 3 --pre cool
```

## Purpose

Finding a good data set to practice, learn, or teach analytics engineering with can be difficult. Most open datasets are great for machine learning -- they offer single wide tables that you can manipulate and analyze. Full, real relational databases on the other hand are generally protected by private companies. Not only that, but they're a bit _too_ real. To get to a state that a beginner or intermediate person can understand, there needs to be an advanced amount of analytics engineering transformation applied.

To that end, this project generates relatively simple, clean (but importantly, not _perfect_) data for a variety of entities in discrete tables, which can be transformed and combined into analytical building blocks. There are even trends (like seasonality) and personas (like buying patterns) that can be sussed out through data modeling!

## Approach

The great [@drewbanin](https://github.com/drewbanin) watched the movie [Synecdoche, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche,_New_York), and was inspired by the idea of creating a complete simulation of a world. Rather than using discrete rules to generate synthetic data, instead setting up entities with behavior patterns and letting them loose to interact with each other. This was the birth of the Jaffle Shop Generator. There are customers, stores, products, and more, all with their own behaviors and interactions as time passes. These combine to create unique and realistic datasets on every run.

An important caveat is that `jafgen` is _not_ idempotent. By design, it generates new data every time you run it based on the simulation's interactions. This is intended behavior, as it allows for more realistic and interesting data generation. Certain aspects are hard coded, like stores opening at certain times, but the output data is always unique.

We hope over time to add more complex behaviors and trends to the simulation!

## Contribution

We welcome contribution to the project! It's relatively simple to get started, just clone the repo, spin up a virtual environment, and install the dependencies:

```shell
gh repo clone dbt-labs/jaffle-shop-generator
python3 -m venv .venv
# Install the package requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install the dev tooling (ruff and pytest)
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

Working out from the `jafgen` command, you can see the main entrypoint in `jaffle_shop_generator/cli.py`. This calls the simulation found in `jafgen/simulation.py`. The simulation is where most of the magic happens.

We recommend installing our githook scripts locally. To do that, install [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) and run
```
lefthook install
```
