**Current month only:**
```bash
moneyflow --mtd
```

**Recent years:**
```bash
moneyflow --year 2025
```

**From specific date:**
```bash
moneyflow --since 2024-06-01
```

**Enable caching:**
```bash
# Cache data to avoid re-downloading
moneyflow --cache

# Force refresh (skip cache)
moneyflow --refresh
```

**All options:**
```bash
moneyflow --help
```

## First Run Setup (Monarch Money)

On first run, moneyflow will guide you through credential setup:

1. **Get your 2FA secret** (before starting):
   - Log into Monarch Money ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security
   - Disable and re-enable 2FA
   - Click "Can't scan?" to view the secret key
   - Copy the BASE32 secret (e.g., `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`)

2. **Launch moneyflow** and enter when prompted:
   - Monarch Money email and password
   - Your 2FA secret key
   - A new encryption password (for moneyflow only)

3. **Done!** Next time, just enter your encryption password.

Your credentials are encrypted with AES-128 and stored in `~/.moneyflow/credentials.enc`.

**To reset credentials**: Click "Reset Credentials" on the unlock screen.

## Time Navigation

moneyflow downloads all transactions once, then filters client-side for instant switching.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- `y` - Current year

## Architecture

### Backend System
- Abstract base class defines required methods

- Demo Backend: Synthetic data generator
- Extensible for YNAB, Lunch Money, or custom platforms

### Technology
- **Polars**: Fast data aggregation
- **Textual**: Terminal UI framework
- **Python 3.11+**: Required
- **Parquet**: Caching format (when --cache used)

### Performance
- Fetches all transactions on startup (1000 per batch)
- Local aggregations using Polars (instant filtering/grouping)
- Parallel API updates for speed

## Troubleshooting

### ModuleNotFoundError

**Solution**: Reinstall dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade moneyflow
# Or from source: uv sync
```

### "uv: command not found"

**Solution**: Restart terminal or add to PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Login fails with "Incorrect password"

**Solutions**:
1. Enter the **encryption password** (moneyflow password), not Monarch password
2. If forgotten, click "Reset Credentials"
3. Manually delete: `rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/`

### 2FA/TOTP secret not working

**Solutions**:
1. Copy the **BASE32 secret** (long string like `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`), not QR code
2. Remove any spaces from the secret
3. Get fresh secret by disabling/re-enabling 2FA

### Terminal displays weird characters

**Solution**: Use a modern terminal with Unicode and ANSI support:
- **macOS**: Terminal.app or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- **Linux**: GNOME Terminal, Alacritty, or Kitty
- **Windows**: [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)

### Complete reset

```bash
# Delete all data
rm -rf ~/.moneyflow/
rm -rf .mm/

# Reinstall
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall moneyflow

# Run again
moneyflow
```
