Analyze the following code diff and write a draft changelog that summarizes the changes made to the codebase between two versions.
Focus on identifying the key changes, improvements, bug fixes, and new features.
Write in a clear, concise style that would be useful for developers and users.
Be sure to include changes to code but also complementary pipelines, scripts, docs.

@git_diff

Output as markdown respecting the classic changelog sections:
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
### Removed
### Deprecated
### Security

Of course, not all sections are required, only include the relevant ones.

Review and polish the following draft changelog that was generated from a git diff.

@draft_changelog

Remove redundancy in the changelog. For instance, I don't want to see the same change presented both as a "Changed" and "Removed".
And when you see several changes that were made for the same purpose, groupd them as a single item.
Don't add fluff, stay sharp and to the point.
Use nice readable markdown formatting.
