**Reasoning:** [One sentence explaining why this matters]

**Additions:**
[List precise rules as imperative commands based on the analysis]

**Deletions:**
[List precise rules about what to stop doing]

**Modifications:**
[List precise rules about what to change]

## CLAUDE.md UPDATES
[Only include if there are SIGNIFICANT changes to code generation principles]

## NO UPDATES NEEDED
[Include this section if no changes represent significant shifts in coding principles]

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- Write rules as IMPERATIVE COMMANDS (Use X, Implement Y, Format Z)
- NO explanations, NO context, NO benefits - just the rule
- Maximum 1 line per rule
- Be specific about WHAT to do, not WHY to do it
- Focus on ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTIONS developers can immediately follow
- If no major changes exist, respond with: \"No AI instruction updates are needed. The changes are minor improvements that don't represent significant shifts in coding principles.\"
