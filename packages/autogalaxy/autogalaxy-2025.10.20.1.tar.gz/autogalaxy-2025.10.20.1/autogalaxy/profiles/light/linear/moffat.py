        Parameters
        ----------
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of the profile centre.
        ell_comps
            The first and second ellipticity components of the elliptical coordinate system, (see the module
        alpha
            Scales the overall size of the Moffat profile and for a PSF typically corresponds to the FWHM / 2.
        beta
            Scales the wings at the outskirts of the Moffat profile, where smaller values imply heavier wings and it
            tends to a Gaussian as beta goes to infinity.
