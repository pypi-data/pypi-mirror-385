    Checks if a light profile is a `LightProfileOperated` class and therefore already has had operations like a

    This is compared to the `only_operated` input to determine if the image of that light profile is returned, or

    Parameters
    ----------
    func
        A function which checks the light profile class and determines what image is returned.

    Returns
    -------
        A function that returns a 2D image.

        This decorator checks if a light profile is a `LightProfileOperated` class and therefore already has had operations like a

        Parameters
        ----------
        obj
            A light profile with an `image_2d_from` function whose class is inspected to determine if the image is
            operated on.
        grid
            A grid_like object of (y,x) coordinates on which the function values are evaluated.
        operated_only
            By default this is None and the image is returned irrespecive of light profile class (E.g. it does not matter
            if it is already operated or not). If this input is included as a bool, the light profile image is only
            returned if they are or are not already operated.

        Returns
        -------
            The 2D image, which is customized depending on whether it has been operated on.
