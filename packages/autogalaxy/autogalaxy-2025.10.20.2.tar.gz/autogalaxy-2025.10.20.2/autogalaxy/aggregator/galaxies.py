    """
    Returns a list of `Galaxy` objects from a `PyAutoFit` loaded directory `Fit` or sqlite database `Fit` object.

    The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
    attributes of the fit:

    - The model and its best fit parameters (e.g. `model.json`).
    - The adapt images associated with adaptive galaxy features (`adapt` folder).

    Each individual attribute can be loaded from the database via the `fit.value()` method.

    This method combines all of these attributes and returns a list of `Galaxy` object for a given non-linear search
    sample (e.g. the maximum likelihood model). This includes associating adapt images with their respective galaxies.

    If multiple `Galaxy` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
    is instead used to load lists of galaxies. This is necessary if each analysis has different galaxies (e.g. certain
    parameters vary across each dataset and `Analysis` object).

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A `PyAutoFit` `Fit` object which contains the results of a model-fit as an entry which has been loaded from
        an output directory or from an sqlite database..
    instance
        A manual instance that overwrites the max log likelihood instance in fit (e.g. for drawing the instance
        randomly from the PDF).

class GalaxiesAgg(af.AggBase):
    """
    Interfaces with an `PyAutoFit` aggregator object to create instances of `Galaxy` objects from the results
    of a model-fit.

    The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
    attributes of the fit:

    - The model and its best fit parameters (e.g. `model.json`).
    - The adapt images associated with adaptive galaxy features (`adapt` folder).

    The `aggregator` contains the path to each of these files, and they can be loaded individually. This class
    can load them all at once and create lists of `Galaxy` objects via the `_galaxies_from` method.

    This class's methods returns generators which create the instances of the `Galaxy` objects. This ensures
    that large sets of results can be efficiently loaded from the hard-disk and do not require storing all
    `Galaxy` instances in the memory at once.

    For example, if the `aggregator` contains 3 model-fits, this class can be used to create a generator which
    creates instances of the corresponding 3 `Galaxy` objects.

    If multiple `Galaxy` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
    is instead used to load lists of galaxies. This is necessary if each analysis has different galaxies (e.g. certain
    parameters vary across each dataset and `Analysis` object).

    This can be done manually, but this object provides a more concise API.

    Parameters
    ----------
    aggregator
        A `PyAutoFit` aggregator object which can load the results of model-fits.
