Core Aims
=========

**PyAutoGalaxy** has three core aims:

- **Model Complexity**: Fitting complex galaxy morphology models (e.g. Multi Gaussian Expansion, Shapelets, Ellipse Fitting, Irregular Meshes) that go beyond just simple Sersic fitting (which is supported too!).

- **Data Variety**: Support for many data types (e.g. CCD imaging, interferometry, multi-band imaging) which can be fitted independently or simultaneously.

- **Big Data**: Scaling automated analysis to extremely large datasets, using tools like an SQL database to build a scalable scientific workflow.

Features
========

Core features include fully automated Bayesian model-fitting of galaxy two-dimensional surface brightness profiles,
support for dataset and interferometer datasets and comprehensive tools for simulating galaxy images. The software
places a focus on **big data** analysis, including support for hierarchical models that simultaneously fit thousands of
galaxies, massively parallel model-fitting and an SQLite3 database that allows large suites of modeling results to be
loaded, queried and analysed.

The software comes distributed with the **HowToGalaxy** Jupyter notebook lectures, which are written assuming no
previous knowledge about galaxy structure and teach a new user theory and statistics required to analyse
galaxy data. Checkout `the howtogalaxy section of
the readthedocs <https://pyautogalaxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtogalaxy/howtogalaxy.html>`_.

Galaxy Morphology & Structure
=============================

The study of galaxy morphology aims to understand the different luminous structures that galaxies are composed of.
Using large CCD imaging datasets of galaxies observed at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths from
instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Astronomers have uncovered the plentiful structures that make up
a galaxy (e.g. bars, bulges, disks and rings) and revealed that evolving galaxies transition from disk-like structures
to bulge-like elliptical galaxies. At sub-mm and radio wavelengths interferometer datasets from instruments like the
Atacama LAM (ALMA) have revealed the integral role that dust plays in forming a galaxy in the distant Universe, early
in its lifetime. Studies typically represent a galaxy's light using analytic functions such as the Sersic
profile, which quantify the global appearance of most galaxies into one of three groups: (i) bulge-like
structures which follow a dev Vaucouleurs profile; (ii) disk-like structures which follow an Exponential profile
or; (iii) irregular morphologies which are difficult to quantify with symmetric and smooth analytic profiles. Galaxies
are often composed of many sub-components which may be a combination of these different structures.

In the next decade, wide field surveys such as Euclid, the Vera Rubin Observatory and Square Kilometer array are
poised to observe images of _billions_ of galaxies. Analysing these extremely large galaxy datasets demands
advanced Bayesian model-fitting techniques which can scale-up in a fully automated manner. Equally, the James Webb
Space Telescope, thirty-meter class ground telescopes and ?radio? will observe galaxies at an
unprecedented resolution and level of detail. This demands more flexible modeling techniques that can accurately
represent the complex irregular structures one such high resolution observations reveal. ``PyAutoGalaxy`` aims to meet
both these needs, by interfacing galaxy model-fitting with the probabilistic programming language ``PyAutoFit`` to
provide Bayesian fitting tools suited to big data analysis alongside image processing tools that represent irregular
galaxy structures using non-parametric models.

How does PyAutoGalaxy Work?
===========================

At the heart of the `PyAutoGalaxy` API is the `Galaxy` object, which groups together one or more `LightProfile` objects
at an input redshift. Passing these objects a `Grid2D` returns an image of the galaxy(s), which can subsequently
be passed through `Operator` objects to apply a 2D convolution or Fast Fourier Transform and thereby compare
the `Galaxy`'s image to an imaging or interferometer dataset. The `inversion` package contains a range of non-parametric
models which fit a galaxy's light using a Bayesian linear matrix inversion. The `astropy` cosmology module is
used to handle unit conversions and calculations are optimized using the packages `NumPy` [@numpy], `numba` [@numba]
and `PyNUFFT` [@pynufft].

.. code-block:: python

    import autogalaxy as ag
    import autogalaxy.plot as aplt

    """
    To describe the galaxy emission two-dimensional grids of (y,x) Cartesian
    coordinates are used.

    )

    """
    The galaxy has an elliptical sersic light profile representing its bulge.

        centre=(0.0, 0.0),

        intensity=1.0,
        effective_radius=0.6,
        sersic_index=3.0,
    )

    """
    The galaxy also has an elliptical exponential disk
    """
    disk = ag.lp.Exponential(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),

    """
    We combine the above light profiles to compose a galaxy at redshift 1.0.
    """
    galaxy = ag.Galaxy(redshift=1.0, bulge=bulge, disk=disk)

    """
    We can use the grid and galaxies to perform many calculations, for example
    plotting the image of the galaxies.

To perform model-fitting, `PyAutoGalaxy` adopts the probabilistic programming
language `PyAutoFit` (https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit). `PyAutoFit` allows users to compose a
model from `LightProfile` and `Galaxy` objects, customize the model parameterization and fit it to data via a
non-linear search (e.g., `dynesty` [@dynesty], `emcee` [@emcee], `PySwarms` [@pyswarms]). By composing a model with
`Pixelization`  objects, the galaxy's light is reconstructed using a non-parametric rectangular
grid or Voronoi mesh that accounts for irregular galaxy morphologies.
