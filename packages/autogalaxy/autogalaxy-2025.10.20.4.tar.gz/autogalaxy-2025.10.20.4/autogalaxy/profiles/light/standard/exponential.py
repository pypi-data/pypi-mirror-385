        Parameters
        ----------
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second centre of the light profile.
        ell_comps
            The first and second ellipticity components of the elliptical coordinate system.
        intensity
            Overall intensity normalisation of the light profile (units are dimensionless and derived from the data
            the light profile's image is compared too, which is expected to be electrons per second).
        effective_radius
            The circular radius containing half the light of this profile.
