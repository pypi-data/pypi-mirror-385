    """
    Returns a list of `FitEllipse` objects from a `PyAutoFit` loaded directory `Fit` or sqlite database `Fit` object.

    The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
    attributes of the fit:

    - The imaging data, noise-map, PSF and settings as .fits files (e.g. `dataset/data.fits`).
    - The mask used to mask the `Imaging` data structure in the fit (`dataset.fits[hdu=0]`).

    Each individual attribute can be loaded from the database via the `fit.value()` method.

    This method combines all of these attributes and returns a `FitEllipse` object for a given non-linear search sample
    (e.g. the maximum likelihood model). This includes associating adapt images with their respective galaxies.

    If multiple `FitEllipse` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
    is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
    `FitEllipse` objects.

    The settings of an inversion can be overwritten by inputting a `settings_inversion` object, for example
    if you want to use a grid with a different inversion solver.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A `PyAutoFit` `Fit` object which contains the results of a model-fit as an entry which has been loaded from
        an output directory or from an sqlite database..
    instance
        A manual instance that overwrites the max log likelihood instance in fit (e.g. for drawing the instance
        randomly from the PDF).

        """
            Interfaces with an `PyAutoFit` aggregator object to create instances of `FitEllipse` objects from the results
            of a model-fit.

            The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
        attributes of the fit:

            - The imaging data, noise-map, PSF and settings as .fits files (e.g. `dataset/data.fits`).
            - The mask used to mask the `Imaging` data structure in the fit (`dataset.fits[hdu=0]`).

            The `aggregator` contains the path to each of these files, and they can be loaded individually. This class
            can load them all at once and create an `FitEllipse` object via the `_fit_ellipse_from` method.

            This class's methods returns generators which create the instances of the `FitEllipse` objects. This ensures
            that large sets of results can be efficiently loaded from the hard-disk and do not require storing all
            `FitEllipse` instances in the memory at once.

            For example, if the `aggregator` contains 3 model-fits, this class can be used to create a generator which
            creates instances of the corresponding 3 `FitEllipse` objects.

            If multiple `Ellipse` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
            is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
            `FitEllipse` objects.

            This can be done manually, but this object provides a more concise API.

            Parameters
            ----------
            aggregator
                A `PyAutoFit` aggregator object which can load the results of model-fits.
