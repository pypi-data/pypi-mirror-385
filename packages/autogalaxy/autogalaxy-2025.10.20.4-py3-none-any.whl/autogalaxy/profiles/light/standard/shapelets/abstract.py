        Abstract Base class of a Shapelet.

        Shapelets are always defined and used as a linear light profile.

        Shapelets are defined according to:

          https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105178

        Shapelets are described in the context of strong lens modeling in:

        Parameters
        ----------
        centre
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of the profile (shapelet) centre.
        ell_comps
            The first and second ellipticity components of the elliptical coordinate system.
        beta
            The characteristic length scale of the shapelet basis function, defined in arc-seconds.
