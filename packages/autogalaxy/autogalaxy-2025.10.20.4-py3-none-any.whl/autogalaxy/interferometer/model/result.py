        This can use either:

        - The model image of each galaxy in the best-fit model.
        - The subtracted image of each galaxy in the best-fit model, where the subtracted image is the dataset
          minus the model images of all other galaxies.

        In **PyAutoLens** these adapt images have had lensing calculations performed on them and therefore for source
        galaxies are their lensed model images in the image-plane.

            If True, the model images of the galaxies are used to create the adapt images. If False, the subtracted
            images of the galaxies are used.
