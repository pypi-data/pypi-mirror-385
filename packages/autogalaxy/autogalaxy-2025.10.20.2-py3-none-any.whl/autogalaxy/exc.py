        f"""
        A linear light profile has been passed to the `{plotter_type}`.

        Linear light profiles cannot be plotted, because they do not have an
        intensity value.

        Therefore convert all linear light profiles to normal light profiles
        with intensity values. 

        The easiest way to do this is to create a`FitImaging` 
        or `FitInterferometer` object. This will contain a property 
        where all linear light have been converted to regular light profiles 
        using the solved for intensities. 
        
        If you are using PyAutoLens, you should use the attribute
        `fit.tracer_linear_light_profiles_to_light_profiles` to access a 
        `Tracer` with these converted light profiles.

        If you are using PyAutoGalaxy, you should instead use
        `fit.galaxies_linear_light_profiles_to_light_profiles` to access
        `Galaxy` objects with these converted light profiles.
             
        If you are using database functionality and creating tracers
        via the `TracerAgg` object or `GalaxiesAgg` object, you should 
        instead use the `FitImagingAgg` object to create `FitImaging` 
        objects.
        
        You should then access what you need via 
        `fit.tracer_linear_light_profiles_to_light_profiles` or
        `fit.galaxies_linear_light_profiles_to_light_profiles`.
