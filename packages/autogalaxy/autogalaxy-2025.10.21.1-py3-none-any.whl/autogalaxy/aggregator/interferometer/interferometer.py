    """
    Returns a list of `Interferometer` objects from a `PyAutoFit` loaded directory `Fit` or sqlite database `Fit` object.

    The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
    attributes of the fit:

    - The interferometer visibilities data as a .fits file (`dataset.fits[hdu=1]`).
    - The visibilities noise-map as a .fits file (`dataset.fits[hdu=2]`).
    - The uv wavelengths as a .fits file (`dataset/uv_wavelengths.fits`).
    - The real space mask defining the grid of the interferometer for the FFT (`dataset/real_space_mask.fits`).
    - The settings of the `Interferometer` data structure used in the fit (`dataset/settings.json`).

    Each individual attribute can be loaded from the database via the `fit.value()` method.

    This method combines all of these attributes and returns a `Interferometer` object, including having its
    settings updated to the values used by the model-fit.

    If multiple `Interferometer` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()`
    method is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
    `Interferometer` objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A `PyAutoFit` `Fit` object which contains the results of a model-fit as an entry which has been loaded from
        an output directory or from an sqlite database..

class InterferometerAgg:
    def __init__(self, aggregator: af.Aggregator):
        """
        Interfaces with an `PyAutoFit` aggregator object to create instances of `Interferometer` objects from the results
        of a model-fit.

        The results of a model-fit can be loaded from hard-disk or stored in a sqlite database, including the following
        attributes of the fit:

        - The interferometer visibilities data as a .fits file (`dataset.fits[hdu=1]`).
        - The visibilities noise-map as a .fits file (`dataset.fits[hdu=2]`).
        - The uv wavelengths as a .fits file (`dataset/uv_wavelengths.fits`).
        - The real space mask defining the grid of the interferometer for the FFT (`dataset/real_space_mask.fits`).
        - The settings of the `Interferometer` data structure used in the fit (`dataset/settings.json`).

        The `aggregator` contains the path to each of these files, and they can be loaded individually. This class
        can load them all at once and create an `Interferometer` object via the `_interferometer_from` method.

        This class's methods returns generators which create the instances of the `Interferometer` objects. This ensures
        that large sets of results can be efficiently loaded from the hard-disk and do not require storing all
        `Interferometer` instances in the memory at once.

        For example, if the `aggregator` contains 3 model-fits, this class can be used to create a generator which
        creates instances of the corresponding 3 `Interferometer` objects.

        If multiple `Interferometer` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()`
        method is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
        `Interferometer` objects.

        This can be done manually, but this object provides a more concise API.

        Parameters
        ----------
        aggregator
