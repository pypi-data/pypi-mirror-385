    "By the end of this tutorial, you should know how to initialize an `Orbit` structure, how to retrieve any of the available orbital elements, and compute the future state of that orbit in the future assuming two body propagation (i.e. _no perturbation of any kind_).\n",

    "For comprehensive and high-fidelity astrodynamics, orbit estimation, and other spaceflight dynamics functionalities essential in real-world missions, consider using [Nyx](https://github.com/nyx-space/nyx/).

    "### Important disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "Two body propagation is a _tool_ and should not be mistaken for a complete representation of real-world scenarios. In actual mission design, the exclusive use of two-body propagation is _physically incorrect and the wrong approach_. This is because a spacecraft or celestial body is invariably influenced by a multitude of factors. These include gravitational forces from other celestial bodies, as well as subtler forces like solar radiation pressure, atmospheric drag, and gravity fields (as, e.g., spherical harmonic modeling), which account for the uneven distribution of a celestial object's mass. **ANISE will only ever support two-body propagation. For high-fidelity astrodynamics, including orbit estimation, the recommended resource is Nyx. Nyx has been integral to several high-profile lunar missions, offering the necessary models for accurate space mission analysis, planning, and operations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the two body propagator in ANISE is super straight-forward: simply call `at_epoch` on an `Orbit` instance. This uses the current mean anomaly of this instance to compute its future mean anomaly using only the time difference between the current epoch and the future epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this converts from the internal Cartesian representation to its Keplerian representation, and back again, so some level of error in the Keplerian orbital elements will be seen, but it should be minimal."

    "All Almanac translation/transform queries return an instance of `Orbit`, populated with the relevant frame information from the Almanac, so gaining familiarity with this structure is important.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tasks:**\n",
    " 1. Fetch the state of a celestial object, like the Moon, at the epoch of your choice.\n",
    " 3. Use the Orbit instance's `at_epoch` to propagate the position of that object forward in time, assuming it was subjected only to two body dynamics.\n",
    " 4. Fetch the state of that same object from the Almanac at that other time, and look at the difference in Cartesian state and orbital elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goal:** Understand the basics of orbital propagation and its limitations."
