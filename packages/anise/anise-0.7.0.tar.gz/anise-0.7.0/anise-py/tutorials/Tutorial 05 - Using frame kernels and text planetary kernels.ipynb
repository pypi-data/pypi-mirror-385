                "SPICE supports text-based kernels. These allow for easy modification and inclusion of documentation directly in the text file. The way SPICE handles these is by keeping a file handler open on the file while it's loaded. This causes a number of issues, such as potential file locking problems, increased risk of data corruption in cases of unexpected software termination, and increased difficulty in managing concurrent access, especially pertinent in the context of onboard flight software. To prevent these issues, ANISE maintains a pointer to the data contained in these files in memory (via a memory mapping or a heap allocation). Moreover, ANISE ensures that the data it uses allows for immediate random access, which is a method of accessing data at any point in memory with equal speed, independent of its location, thereby speeding up searches within the kernel data. To facilitate this, the data is stored in a platform-independent binary structure using the ASN.1 DER specification (the telecommunications industry standard for 20+ years). ASN.1 offers advantages like well-defined data structures, robust encoding schemes, and ease of interoperability across different platforms, making it a reliable choice for storing kernel data.\n",

                "\n",
                "However, this also means that ANISE cannot load the text files directly. Instead, these must be converted into the ANISE format, respectively PCA and EPA for \"Planetary Constants ANISE\" kernel and \"Euler Parameter ANISE\" kernel. Euler parameters, also known as quaternion parameters, offer a compact and non-redundant representation of orientations in three dimensions, differing from quaternions in their normalization constraint and being slightly more robust to numerical errors in certain computational scenarios.\n",

However, until version `1.0.0`, the structure _may_ change and if so, the updated version of the default PCA and EPA files will be added to the Nyx Space cloud.\n",

This is only used if the data set cannot be properly decoded to inform the user of the expected ANISE version and the one that they're trying to load. In other words, although there is a version `0.3` of the PCK08 and PCK11 kernels, the files used in version `0.1.0` are still compatible."
