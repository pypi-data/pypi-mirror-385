    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Image persistence in the IR array occurs whenever a pixel is exposed to light that exceeds more than about half of the full well of a pixel in the array. Persistence can occur within a single visit, as the different exposures in a visit are dithered. Persistence also occurs from observations in a previous visit of completely different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image persistence is seen in a small, but non-negligible fraction of WFC3/IR exposures. Its properties are discussed in the WFC3 Instrument Handbook in [Chapter 8](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentDHB/Chapter8_persistence1.html). Persistence is primarily a function of the degree to which a pixel is filled (in electrons) and the time since this occurred. Additional information is available from the [WFC3 Persistence Webpage](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/ins_performance/persistence/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use persistence products to update the data quality (DQ) array of the IR calibrated FLT dataset for use with AstroDrizzle. When the data is sufficiently dithered, affected regions of the detector may be replaced with 'good' pixels from other exposures in the visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Download the data from MAST \n",
    "        Download the persistence data products\n",
    "        Define a lower threshold in the persistence model for defining a mask (eg. >0.005 e/s)\n",
    "        For affected pixels, add flag 16384 to the DQ array values\n",
    "        Redrizzle the FLT data to produce a cleaned DRZ product"
