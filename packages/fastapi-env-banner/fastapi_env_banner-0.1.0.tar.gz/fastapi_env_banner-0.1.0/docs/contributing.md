```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Example

```python
def get_banner_color(self) -> str:
    """Get the banner background color based on environment.
    
    Returns:
        str: Hexadecimal color code
    """
    if self.custom_color:
        return self.custom_color
    
    return self.color_map.get(self.environment, "#4CAF50")
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure tests cover both happy path and edge cases
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in classes

### Test Structure

```python
class TestFeatureName:
    """Tests for feature description."""
    
    def test_happy_path(self):
        """Test the expected behavior."""
        # Arrange
        config = EnvBannerConfig()
        
        # Act
        result = config.get_banner_color()
        
        # Assert
        assert result == "#4CAF50"
    
    def test_edge_case(self):
        """Test edge case behavior."""
        # Test implementation
```
