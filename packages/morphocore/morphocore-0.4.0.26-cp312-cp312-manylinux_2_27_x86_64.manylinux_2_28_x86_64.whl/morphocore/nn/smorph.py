    Module that approximate both erosion and dilation using an alpha parameter

    Behaviour of alpha : 
     - When alpha -> ∞ then Smorph tends to be a dilation 
     - When alpha -> -∞ then Smorph tends to be an erosion
     - When alpha is close to 0 -> then Smorph is something between an erosion and a dilation.
