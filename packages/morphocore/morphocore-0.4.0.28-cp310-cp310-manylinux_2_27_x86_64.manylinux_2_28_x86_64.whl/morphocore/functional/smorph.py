    """ 
    Function that approximates a dilation or an erosion depending on an alpha control parameter.

    Formula : (Needs reflection)

    Behaviour of alpha : 
        - When alpha -> ∞ then Smorph tends to be a dilation.
        - When alpha -> -∞ then Smorph tends to be an erosion.
        - When alpha is close to 0 -> then Smorph is something between an erosion and a dilation.
