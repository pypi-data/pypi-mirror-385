# Overview

This section presents practical examples and use cases, where pyosmium can
come in handy. Each cookbook comes with three sections:

* __Task__ explains what should be achieved
* __Quick Solution__ gives you a ready to use script that solves the task
* __Background__ explains in detail what happens in the script and why it
  is done the way it is done. This should help you to write similar scripts
  on your own.

All cookbooks are available as Jupiter notebooks in the
[pyosmium source tree](https://github.com/osmcode/pyosmium/tree/master/docs/cookbooks/)
