    "It is safe to restrict the FileProcessor to the RELATION type because we are only interested in relations and don't need geometry information. A cycling route comes with two mandatory tags in OSM, `type=route` and `route=bicycle`. To filter for relations that have _both_ tags in them, simply chain two TagFilters. Don't just use a single filter with two tags like this: `osmium.filter.TagFilter(('type', 'route'), ('route', 'bicycle'))`.  This would filter for relation that have either the route tag or the type tag. Not exactly what we want.\n",

    "For each relation that goes through the filter, save the information needed. Resist the temptation to simply save the complete relation. For one thing, a single relation can become quite large. But more importantly, pyosmium will not allow you to access the object anymore once the end of the loop iteraton is reached. You only ever see a temporary view of an object within the processing loop. You need to make a full copy of what you want to keep.\n",
