    "The FileProcessor reads the data and SimpleWriter writes the nodes out that we are interested in. Given that we are looking at nodes only, the FileProcessor can be restricted to that type. For one thing, this makes processing faster. For another it means, we don't have to explicitly check for the type of the object within the for loop. We can trust that only nodes will be returned. Checking if a node should be included in the output file is a simple matter of computing the distance between the target coordinates and the location of the node. pyosmium has a convenient function `haversine_distance()` for that. It computes the distance between two points in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a file with nodes. But what about the ways and relations? To find out which ones to include, we need to follow the _forward references_. Given the IDs of the nodes already included in the file, we need to find the ways which reference any of the nodes. And then we need to find relations which reference either nodes already included or one of the newly found ways. Luckily for us, OSM files are ordered by node, way and relations. So by the time the FileProcessor sees the first way, it will already have seen all the nodes and it can make an informed decision, if the way needs including or not. The same is true for relations. They are last in the file, so all the node and way members have been processed already. The situation is more complicated with relation members and nested relations. We leave those out for the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that nodes, ways and relations need to be handled differently and we need to carry quite a bit of state, it is easier to implement the forward referencing collector as a [handler class](../../user_manual/05-Working-with-Handlers.md):"
