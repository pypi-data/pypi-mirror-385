    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you want to look at more than one OSM object at the time, you need to cache objects. Before starting such a task, it is always worth taking a closer look at the objects of interest. Find out how many candidates there are for you to look at and save and how large these objects are. There are always multiple ways to cache your data. Sometimes, when the number of candidates is really large, it is even more sensible to reread the file instead of caching the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the boundary problem, the calculation is relatively straightforward. Boundary relations are huge, so we do not want to cache them if it can somehow be avoided. That means we need to cache the place nodes. A quick look at [TagInfo](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/place) tells us that there are about 7 million place nodes in the OSM planet. That is not a lot in the grand scheme of things. We could just read them all into memory and be done with it. It is still worth to take a closer look. The place nodes are later matched up by their `wikidata` tag. Looking into the [TagInfo combinations table](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/place#combinations), only 10% of the place nodes have such a tag. That leaves 850.000 nodes to cache. Much better!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to consider what information actually needs caching. In our case we want it all: the ID, the tags and the coordinates of the node. This information needs to be copied out of the node. You cannot just cache the entire node. Pyosmium won't let you do this because it wants to get rid of it as soon as the handler has seen it. Lets create a dataclass to receive the information we need:"

    "There are two things you should keep in mind, when working with areas:\n",

    "2. The area handler automatically enables caching of node locations. You don't need to worry about this when working with small files like our Liechtenstein example. For larger files of continent- or planet-size, the node cache can become quite large. You should read up about the alternative implementations that can write out the node cache on disk to save RAM.\n",

This is not really necessary because the nodes come always before the relations in the file. The quick solution shows how to combine both handlers to create the geojson file in a single pass. The only part to pay attention to is the use of filters. Given that we have very different filters for nodes and relations, it is important to call `enable_for()` with the correct OSM type."
