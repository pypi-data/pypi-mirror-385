I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for your project.

Here's what I can do for you:

- **Find files** using glob patterns to search across your codebase
- **Search file contents** using regex patterns to locate specific code or text
- **Read files** when you know the exact path you need
- **Perform file operations** like listing directories or checking file structure

Your repository is located at `/Users/iflath/git/kentro-tech/air-socials` and appears to be a git repo on the main branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore? Just let me know:
1. What files or patterns you're looking for
2. What code or text you want to find
3. What part of the codebase you want to understand

I'm ready when you are!
