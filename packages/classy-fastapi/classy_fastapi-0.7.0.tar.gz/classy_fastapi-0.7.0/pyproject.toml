# Older versions gave tons of warnings with each assert error due to lack of Python 3.12 support (see
# https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/10894). I couldn't find documentation about which specific release fixes
# this but the PR linked here was merged in 2023 so as long as we're not using the super old version bundled with
# Pants we should be OK. Here we specify a version that came out in 2024 to be safe.
