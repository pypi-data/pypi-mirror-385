Welcome to Morphopy's documentation!
====================================

MorphoPy is a Python3 package that uses networkX to compute and show information
about neurites. The input can be passed with single swc-files or it can handle
whole directories with multiple files at once. You can use MorphoPy imported in
Python or from command line as batch-tool as well.

You can find MorphoPy with more information `here... <https://github.com/berenslab/MorphoPy>`_
