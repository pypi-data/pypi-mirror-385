Changes
=======

0.7.0 (2025-11-19)
------------------

* **CBERS/WFI**: Added full support for CBERS/WFI 8D data cube. üõ∞Ô∏è
* **New Notebooks**: Added several example notebooks:
    * ``simplecube_cbers_rgb.ipynb``: An example for creating a RGB CBERS/WFI 8D data cube.
* **Fix**: Resolved an ``simplecube`` import error, added `pystac-client` module.


0.6.0 (2025-10-14)
------------------

* **NetCDF Support**: The ``simplecube`` function can now create data cubes directly from NetCDF files.
* **GRIB2 Support**: The ``simplecube`` function can now create data cubes directly from GRIB2 files.
* **SAMeT Daily**: Added full support for SAMeT Daily data. üõ∞Ô∏è
* **Function Update**: Updated the ``get_timeseries_datacube`` function to align with new NetCDF and remote file capabilities.
* **MERGE Daily**: Added full support for MERGE Daily Precipitation data. üõ∞Ô∏è
* **New Notebooks**: Added several example notebooks:
    * ``simplecube_s2_rgb.ipynb``: An example for creating a RGB Sentinel-2 data cube.
    * ``simplecube_s2_interpolate.ipynb``: An example for creating a Sentinel-2 cloud interpolate data cube.
    * ``simplecube_s2_smoothed.ipynb``: An example for creating a Sentinel-2  data cube.
    * ``simplecube_s2_spectral_indices.ipynb``: An example for creating a Sentinel-2  data cube and calculating NDVI, EVI2, NDWI and SAVI spectral indices.


0.5.0 (2025-09-25)
------------------

* **Multi-band Support**: It is now possible to create an ``xarray`` data cube with more than one band.
* **COG Support**: Added support for reading Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) with RasterIO, allowing data cube creation without downloading the images. üõ∞Ô∏è
* **New Function**: Added ``simple_cube_download``, which preserves the previous version's behavior of downloading scenes locally.
* **Optimization**: Band data is now automatically cast to ``Int16`` to reduce memory usage.


0.4.0 (2025-07-16)
