## [1.0.2] - 2025-01-15

### Major Release - Complete Library Redesign ðŸš€

This version represents a complete rewrite of GPlay Scraper with a focus on modularity, extensibility, and comprehensive data extraction across all Google Play Store features.

### New Features

#### 7 Method Types with 42 Functions

- **App Methods** - Extract 65+ data fields from any app (ratings, installs, pricing, permissions, screenshots, etc.)
- **Search Methods** - Search Google Play Store apps with comprehensive filtering and pagination
- **Reviews Methods** - Extract user reviews with ratings, timestamps, helpful votes, and detailed feedback
- **Developer Methods** - Get all apps published by a specific developer using developer ID
- **List Methods** - Access top charts (TOP_FREE, TOP_PAID, TOP_GROSSING) by category with 54 categories
- **Similar Methods** - Find similar/competitor apps for market research and competitive analysis
- **Suggest Methods** - Get search suggestions and autocomplete for ASO keyword research

Each method type includes 6 functions:
- `analyze()` - Get all data as dictionary/list
- `get_field()` - Get single field value
- `get_fields()` - Get multiple fields as dictionary
- `print_field()` - Print single field to console
- `print_fields()` - Print multiple fields to console
- `print_all()` - Print all data as formatted JSON

#### 7 HTTP Clients with Automatic Fallback

- **requests** (default) - Standard Python HTTP library, reliable and well-tested
- **curl_cffi** - Browser impersonation with TLS fingerprinting, best for avoiding detection
- **tls_client** - Custom TLS fingerprinting, good for bypassing restrictions
- **httpx** - Modern async-capable HTTP client with HTTP/2 support
- **urllib3** - Low-level HTTP client with connection pooling
- **cloudscraper** - Cloudflare bypass capabilities
- **aiohttp** - Async HTTP client for high-performance concurrent requests

Automatic fallback system tries clients in order until one succeeds, ensuring maximum reliability.

#### Multi-Language & Multi-Region Support

- Support for 100+ languages (en, es, fr, de, ja, ko, zh, ar, etc.)
- Support for 150+ countries (us, gb, ca, au, in, br, jp, etc.)
- Get localized app data, reviews, and search results
- Region-specific pricing and availability information

#### Comprehensive Data Extraction

- **65+ App Fields**: title, developer, ratings, installs, price, screenshots, permissions, release date, update date, size, version, content rating, privacy policy, and more
- **Review Data**: user name, rating, review text, timestamp, app version, helpful votes, developer reply
