# Piket: Pikmin e+ Card Tools
All-in-one package for converting and managing Pikmin e+ Cards, pronounced "picket".

Now with support for Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux!

## Current Capabilities
- Decode `.raw` to editable level data
- Encode editable level data to `.raw`

### Future Plans
- Introduce classes for in-house manipulation!
  - `Card`: manipulate the primary card data
  - `Level`: manipulate individual level data (`set_camera`, `set_character`, `set_tile`, etc.)

## Installation
Easily include Piket in your projects with `pip`:
```
pip install piket
```

## Demo
Try Piket now with the **Drag-and-Drop Converter**!
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate # or source .venv/bin/activate
pip install piket[demo]
python -m piket.converter
```
This demo allows you to easily drag-and-drop .raw files and get decoded .bin files, and then vice versa!

## Usage Guide
Use Piket to easily decode, manipulate, and then re-encode `.raw` card files.
```py
import piket

card = piket.decode("card.raw")
card[0x115] = 0x1 # set tile (0, 0) to grass
new_raw = piket.encode(card, "card.raw")
```
