What is ht?
-----------

ht is open-source software for engineers and technicians working in the
fields of chemical or mechanical engineering. It includes modules
for various heat transfer functions.

Among the tasks this library can be used for are:

* Sizing a Shell & Tube heat exchanger using any of the Zukauskas, ESDU 73031, or Bell methods
* Calculating pressure drop in a Hairpin heat exchanger
* Calculating heat loss of objects, including insulated objects
* Calculating heat loss from buried pipe
* Performing radiative heat transfer calculations
* Conderser and Reboiler rating
* Detailed heat exchanger evaluation; finding fouling factors
* Heat transfer in packed beds
* Sizing a Plate and Frame heat exchanger
* Modeling an Air Cooler
* Supercritical CO2 or water heat transfer

The ht library depends on the SciPy library to provide numerical constants,
interpolation, integration, and numerical solving functionality. ht runs on
all operating systems which support Python, is quick to install, and is free
of charge. ht is designed to be easy to use while still providing powerful
functionality. If you need to perform some heat transfer calculations, give
ht a try.

Installation
------------

Get the latest version of ht from
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ht/

If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

    $ pip install ht

Alternatively, if you are using `conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`_ as your package management, you can simply
install ht in your environment from `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ channel with:

    $ conda install -c conda-forge ht

To get the git version, run:

    $ git clone git://github.com/CalebBell/ht.git
