# Mnemosyne Journaling

A simple encrypted journaling application. Named after the ancient Greek goddess of memories.

## Usage

This app exposes a command line utility at `siru-mnemosyne`. Use `siru-mnemosyne --help` to get more information about available command arguments. Or simply run `siru-mnemosyne` to use the app in an interactive manner.

As for the command name, it is rather long, but this avoids having namespace issues with other apps as it is using a preexisting name. It is always possible to alias this to something quicker to type on the target system. For Windows look into the `doskey` command, and for Unix/Linux/MacOS look into the `alias` command.

## Lastly

To follow in the footsteps of one of my professors, if you actually read this far, please send me a simple picture of a cute otter, and I will be pleasantly surprised that people would actually read all of this.
