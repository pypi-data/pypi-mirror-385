# AbstractFramework

**A unified ecosystem for AI-powered applications and intelligent systems.**

AbstractFramework is an umbrella project that brings together a comprehensive suite of tools and libraries for building sophisticated AI applications. Each component is designed to work seamlessly together while maintaining independence and modularity.

## 🏗️ Framework Components

### 📚 [AbstractCore](https://github.com/lpalbou/AbstractCore) ✅ **Available**
*Unified Python library for interaction with multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers.*

**Write once, run everywhere.**

- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and more
- **Tool Calling**: Universal function calling across providers  
- **Structured Output**: Type-safe Pydantic integration
- **Embeddings & RAG**: Built-in vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Session Management**: Persistent conversations and analytics
- **Server Mode**: Optional OpenAI-compatible API server

```python
from abstractcore import create_llm

# Works with any provider
llm = create_llm("anthropic", model="claude-3-5-haiku-latest")
response = llm.generate("What is the capital of France?")
print(response.content)
```

### 🧠 AbstractMemory 🚧 **Coming Soon**
*Advanced memory systems for AI agents and applications.*

- **Persistent Memory**: Long-term storage and retrieval
- **Contextual Memory**: Semantic understanding and associations
- **Memory Hierarchies**: Short-term, working, and long-term memory
- **Memory Compression**: Efficient storage of large contexts
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Maintain context across interactions

### 🤖 AbstractAgent 🚧 **Coming Soon**
*Intelligent agent framework with reasoning and tool use capabilities.*

- **Autonomous Reasoning**: Multi-step problem solving
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with external tools
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Task planning and execution
- **Learning Capabilities**: Adaptive behavior from experience
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in guardrails and monitoring

### 🐝 AbstractSwarm 🚧 **Coming Soon**
*Multi-agent coordination and swarm intelligence systems.*

- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents
- **Distributed Processing**: Scale across multiple nodes
- **Emergent Behavior**: Complex behaviors from simple interactions
- **Communication Protocols**: Inter-agent messaging and coordination
- **Collective Intelligence**: Leverage swarm problem-solving

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install the full framework (when all components are available)
pip install abstractframework[all]

# Or install individual components
pip install abstractcore[all]  # Available now
pip install abstractmemory     # Coming soon
pip install abstractagent      # Coming soon  
pip install abstractswarm      # Coming soon
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import abstractframework as af

# Create an intelligent agent with memory and LLM capabilities
agent = af.create_agent(
    llm_provider="openai",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    memory_type="persistent",
    tools=["web_search", "calculator", "file_system"]
)

# Have a conversation with persistent memory
response = agent.chat("Remember that I prefer Python over JavaScript")
print(response)

# The agent remembers across sessions
response = agent.chat("What programming language do I prefer?")
print(response)  # "You prefer Python over JavaScript"
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. **Intelligent Applications**
