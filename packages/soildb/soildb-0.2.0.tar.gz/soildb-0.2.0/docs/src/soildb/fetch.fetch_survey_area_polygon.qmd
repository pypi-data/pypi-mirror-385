# fetch.fetch_survey_area_polygon { #soildb.fetch.fetch_survey_area_polygon }

```python
fetch.fetch_survey_area_polygon(
    areasymbols,
    columns=None,
    include_geometry=True,
    chunk_size=1000,
    client=None,
)
```

Fetch survey area polygon data for a list of area symbols.

Performance Notes:
- Survey area boundaries are large polygons; geometry data is substantial
- Most use cases only need a few survey areas at a time
- Consider tabular queries first, then fetch geometry only when needed

Args:
    areasymbols: Survey area symbol(s) (single symbol or list of symbols)
    columns: Columns to select (default: key columns + geometry)
    include_geometry: Whether to include polygon geometry as WKT
    chunk_size: Chunk size for pagination (usually not needed for survey areas)
    client: Optional SDA client

Returns:
    SDAResponse with survey area polygon data
