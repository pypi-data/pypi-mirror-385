# fetch.fetch_mapunit_polygon { #soildb.fetch.fetch_mapunit_polygon }

```python
fetch.fetch_mapunit_polygon(
    mukeys,
    columns=None,
    include_geometry=True,
    chunk_size=1000,
    client=None,
)
```

Fetch map unit polygon data for a list of mukeys.

Performance Notes:
- Geometry data significantly increases response size and processing time
- For large areas, consider using smaller chunk_size (500-1000)
- Polygon geometries can be very large; consider bbox filtering first

Args:
    mukeys: Map unit key(s) (single key or list of keys)
    columns: Columns to select (default: key columns from schema + geometry)
    include_geometry: Whether to include polygon geometry as WKT
    chunk_size: Chunk size for pagination (recommended: 500-1000 for geometry)
    client: Optional SDA client

Returns:
    SDAResponse with map unit polygon data
