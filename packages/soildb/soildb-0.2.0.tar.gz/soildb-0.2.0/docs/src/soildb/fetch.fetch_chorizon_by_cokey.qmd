# fetch.fetch_chorizon_by_cokey { #soildb.fetch.fetch_chorizon_by_cokey }

```python
fetch.fetch_chorizon_by_cokey(
    cokeys,
    columns=None,
    chunk_size=1000,
    client=None,
)
```

Fetch chorizon data for a list of cokeys.

Performance Notes:
- Horizon data includes detailed soil properties (texture, chemistry, etc.)
- Each component typically has 3-7 horizons; expect large result sets
- Use chunk_size of 200-500 for large cokey lists

Args:
    cokeys: Component key(s) (single key or list of keys)
    columns: Columns to select (default: key chorizon columns from schema)
    chunk_size: Chunk size for pagination (recommended: 200-500)
    client: Optional SDA client

Returns:
    SDAResponse with chorizon data
