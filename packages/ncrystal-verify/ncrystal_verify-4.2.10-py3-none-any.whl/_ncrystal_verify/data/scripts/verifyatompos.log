usage: ncrystal_verifyatompos [-h] [--quiet] [--wyckoff] [--epsilon EPSILON]
                              FILE

Load input file (for instance an .ncmat file) with NCrystal and verify that
the atom-positions are compatible with the indicated space group. Input must
be in a format supported by NCrystal (e.g. .ncmat), and must represent a
crystalline material with space group and atom position information. And exit
code of 0 indicates no issues found with atom positions, exit code of 1
indicates issues, and exit code of 99 indicates that the material is not
crystalline with space group and atom positions. The symmetry checking is
internally performed with the help of the ASE[1] spacegroup module, so it
might be necessary to install this module first with: python3 -mpip install

positional arguments:
  FILE               File to load

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --quiet            Will not produce any output unless errors are found
  --wyckoff          Output just Wyckoff positions in easily parsable format
                     (implies --quiet, except for the Wyckoff positions).
  --epsilon EPSILON  Level of precision required

The 4 positions are generated from the following symmetry-unique points:

Symmetry-unique point: [0. 0. 0.]
    -> Point (0, 0, 0) deviates 0 from expected position
    -> Point (0, 0.5, 0.5) deviates 0 from expected position
    -> Point (0.5, 0, 0.5) deviates 0 from expected position
    -> Point (0.5, 0.5, 0) deviates 0 from expected position

==========================> Done.

All OK! Atom positions are from these Wyckoff positions for SG 225 (setting=1):
