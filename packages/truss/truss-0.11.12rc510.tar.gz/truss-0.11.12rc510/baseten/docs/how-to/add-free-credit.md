# Granting credit to an org

...is super simple, everything is done via `/billip`.

### Assuming we're trying to add to an organization's free credit _in production_, do the following:

1. Make sure you're logged into the production admin/superuser account on app.baseten.co

2. Go to https://app.baseten.co/billip/users/billingmonetarycredittransaction/add/

3. Select the organization you want to add credits to, enter a **positive** amount (**in cents**), and set the reason to `MANUAL` and hit `SAVE`

4. That's it!

If you've already found the organization in Billip, you can also do the following:

1. From the organization's page, go down to Monetary credit section and click "Add transaction"

2. Enter a **positive** amount (**in cents**), and set the reason to `MANUAL` and hit `SAVE`

3. That's it!
