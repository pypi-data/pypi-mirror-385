        Transcoding is designed to minimize video file size while maintaining maximum
        visual quality. This is done so that the video can be delivered and viewed on
        any device, on any Internet connection, anywhere in the world. It's always a
        compromise between video/audio quality and delivery+viewing quality (QoE).

        Our experts have selected the optimal parameters for transcoding, to ensure
        maximum video/audio quality with the best compression. Default quality sets are
        described in the
        [documentation](https://gcore.com/docs/streaming-platform/live-streams-and-videos-protocols-and-codecs/output-parameters-after-transcoding-bitrate-frame-rate-and-codecs).
        These values are the default for everyone. There is no need to configure
        anything additional.

        [How we lowered the bitrate for live and VOD streaming by 32.5% without sacrificing quality](https://gcore.com/blog/how-we-lowered-the-bitrate-for-live-and-vod-streaming-by-32-5-without-sacrificing-quality).

        Only for those cases when, in addition to the main parameters, it is necessary
        to use your own, then it is necessary to use custom quality sets.

        How to use:

        1. By default custom quality set is empty â€“ `{ "live":[],"vod":[] }`
        2. Request the use of custom quality sets from your manager or the Support Team.
        3. Please forward your requirements to us, since the parameters are set not by
           you, but by our engineers. (We are working to ensure that later you can
           create qualities by yourself.)
        4. Use the created quality sets through the these specified API methods.

        Here are some common parameters of quality settings:

        - Resolution: Determines the size of the video frame. I.e. 720p, 1080p, 4K, etc.
        - Bitrate: Refers to the amount of data processed per unit of time.
        - Codec: Codec used for transcoding can significantly affect quality. Popular
          codecs include H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC), and AV1.
        - Frame Rate: Determines how many frames per second are displayed. Common frame
          rates include 24fps, 30fps, and 60fps.
        - Color Depth and Chroma Subsampling: These settings determine the accuracy of
          color representation in the video.
        - Audio Bitrate and Codec: Don't forget about the audio :) Bitrate and codec
          used for audio can also affect the overall quality. Note: Custom quality set
          is a paid feature.
