        **Methods of creating**

        To upload the original video file to the server, there are several possible
        scenarios:

        - **Copy from another server** – If your video is accessable via "http://",
          "https://", or "sftp://" public link, then you can use this method to copy a
          file from an external server. Set `origin_url` parameter with the link to the
          original video file (i.e. "https://domain.com/video.mp4"). After method
          execution file will be uploaded and will be sent to transcoding automatically,
          you don't have to do anything else. Use extra field `origin_http_headers` if
          authorization is required on the external server.

        - **Direct upload from a local device** – If you need to upload video directly
          from your local device or from a mobile app, then use this method. Keep
          `origin_url` empty and use TUS protocol ([tus.io](https://tus.io)) to upload
          file. More details are here
          ["Get TUS' upload"](/docs/api-reference/streaming/videos/get-tus-parameters-for-direct-upload)

        After getting the video, it is processed through the queue. There are 2 priority
        criteria: global and local. Global is determined automatically by the system as
        converters are ready to get next video, so your videos rarely queue longer than
        usual (when you don't have a dedicated region). Local priority works at the
        level of your account and you have full control over it, look at "priority"
        attribute.

        **AI processing**

        When uploading a video, it is possible to automatically create subtitles based
        on AI.

        Read more:

        - What is
          ["AI Speech Recognition"](/docs/api-reference/streaming/ai/create-ai-asr-task).
        - If the option is enabled via
          `auto_transcribe_audio_language: auto|<language_code>`, then immediately after
          successful transcoding, an AI task will be automatically created for
          transcription.
        - If you need to translate subtitles from original language to any other, then
          AI-task of subtitles translation can be applied. Use
          `auto_translate_subtitles_language: default|<language_codes,>` parameter for
          that. Also you can point several languages to translate to, then a separate
          subtitle will be generated for each specified language.
        - How to
          ["add AI-generated subtitles to an exist video"](/docs/api-reference/streaming/subtitles/add-subtitle).

        The created AI-task(s) will be automatically executed, and result will also be
        automatically attached to this video as subtitle(s).

        Please note that transcription is done automatically for all videos uploaded to
        our video hosting. If necessary, you can disable automatic creation of
        subtitles. If AI is disabled in your account, no AI functionality is called.

        **Advanced Features**

        For details on the requirements for incoming original files, and output video
        parameters after transcoding, refer to the Knowledge Base documentation. By
        default video will be transcoded according to the original resolution, and a
        quality ladder suitable for your original video will be applied. There is no
        automatic upscaling; the maximum quality is taken from the original video.

        If you want to upload specific files not explicitly listed in requirements or
        wish to modify the standard quality ladder (i.e. decrease quality or add new
        non-standard qualities), then such customization is possible. Please reach out
        to us for assistance.

        Additionally, check the Knowledge Base for any supplementary information you may
        need.

        Changes parameters of the video to new values.

        It's allowed to update only those public parameters that are described in POST
        method to create a new “video” entity. So it's not possible to change calculated
        parameters like "id", "duration", "`hls_url`", etc.

        Examples of changing:

        - Name: `{ "name": "new name of the video" }`
        - Move the video to a new directory: ` { "directory_id": 200 }`

        Please note that some parameters are used on initial step (before transcoding)
        only, so after transcoding there is no use in changing their values. For
        example, "`origin_url`" parameter is used for downloading an original file from
        a source and never used after transcoding; or "priority" parameter is used to
        set priority of processing and never used after transcoding.

        Args:
          name: Video name

          auto_transcribe_audio_language: Automatic creation of subtitles by transcribing the audio track.

              Values:

              - disable – Do not transcribe.
              - auto – Automatically detects the activation of the option based on the
                settings in your account. If generation is activated, then automatic language
                detection while transcribing.
              - \\  – Transcribe from specific language. Can be used to specify the exact
                language spoken in the audio track, or when auto language detection fails.
                Language is set by 3-letter language code according to ISO-639-2
                (bibliographic code). List of languages is available in `audio_language`
                attribute of API POST /streaming/ai/transcribe .

              Example:

              ```
              auto_transcribe_audio_language: "auto"
              auto_transcribe_audio_language: "ger"

                [POST /streaming/videos/{`video_id`}/subtitles](/docs/api-reference/streaming/subtitles/add-subtitle).

          auto_translate_subtitles_language: Automatic translation of auto-transcribed subtitles to the specified
              language(s). Can be used both together with `auto_transcribe_audio_language`
              option only.

              Use it when you want to make automatic subtitles in languages other than the
              original language in audio.

              Values:

              - disable – Do not translate.
              - default – There are 3 default languages: eng,fre,ger
              - \\  – Explicit language to translate to, or list of languages separated by a
                comma. Look at list of available languages in description of AI ASR task
                creation.

              If several languages are specified for translation, a separate subtitle will be
              generated for each language.

              Example:

              ```
              auto_translate_subtitles_language: default
              auto_translate_subtitles_language: eng,fre,ger
              ```

              Please note that subtitle translation is done separately and after
              transcription. Thus separate AI-tasks are created for translation.

          client_user_id: Custom field where you can specify user ID in your system

          clip_duration_seconds: The length of the trimmed segment to transcode, instead of the entire length of
              the video. Is only used in conjunction with specifying the start of a segment.
              Transcoding duration is a number in seconds.

          clip_start_seconds: If you want to transcode only a trimmed segment of a video instead of entire
              length if the video, then you can provide timecodes of starting point and
              duration of a segment to process. Start encoding from is a number in seconds.

          custom_iframe_url: Deprecated.

              Custom URL of IFrame for video player to be used in share panel in player. Auto
              generated IFrame URL provided by default

          description: Video details; not visible to the end-users

          directory_id: ID of the directory where the video should be uploaded. (beta)

          origin_http_headers: Authorization HTTP request header. Will be used as credentials to authenticate a
              request to download a file (specified in "`origin_url`" parameter) on an
              external server.

              Syntax: `Authorization: <auth-scheme> <authorization-parameters>`

              Examples:

              - "`origin_http_headers`": "Authorization: Basic ..."
              - "`origin_http_headers`": "Authorization: Bearer ..."
              - "`origin_http_headers`": "Authorization: APIKey ..." Example of usage when
                downloading a file from Google Drive:

              ```
              POST https://api.gcore.com/streaming/videos

              "video": {
                "name": "IBC 2024 intro.mp4",
                "origin_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/...?alt=media",
                "origin_http_headers": "Authorization: Bearer ABC"
              }
              ```

          origin_url: URL to an original file which you want to copy from external storage. If
              specified, system will download the file and will use it as video source for
              transcoding.

          poster: Poster is your own static image which can be displayed before the video starts.

              After uploading the video, the system will automatically create several
              screenshots (they will be stored in "screenshots" attribute) from which you can
              select an default screenshot. This "poster" field is for uploading your own
              image. Also use attribute "`screenshot_id`" to select poster as a default
              screnshot.

              Attribute accepts single image as base64-encoded string
              [(RFC 2397 – The "data" URL scheme)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397). In
              format: `data:[<mediatype>];base64,<data>`

              MIME-types are image/jpeg, image/webp, and image/png and file sizes up to 1Mb.

              Examples:

              - `data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AA...qf/2Q==`
              - `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGg...ggg==`
              - `data:image/webp;base64,UklGRt.../DgAAAAA`

          priority: Priority allows you to adjust the urgency of processing some videos before
              others in your account, if your algorithm requires it. For example, when there
              are very urgent video and some regular ones that can wait in the queue.

              Value range, integer [-10..10]. -10 is the lowest down-priority, 10 is the
              highest up-priority. Default priority is 0.

          projection: Deprecated.

              Regulates the video format:

              - **regular** — plays the video as usual
              - **vr360** — plays the video in 360 degree mode
              - **vr180** — plays the video in 180 degree mode
              - **vr360tb** — plays the video in 3D 360 degree mode Top-Bottom.

              Default is regular

          quality_set_id: Custom quality set ID for transcoding, if transcoding is required according to
              your conditions. Look at GET /`quality_sets` method

          remote_poster_url: Poster URL to download from external resource, instead of uploading via "poster"
              attribute.

              It has the same restrictions as "poster" attribute.

          remove_poster: Set it to true to remove poster

          screenshot_id: Default screenshot index.

              Specify an ID from the "screenshots" array, so that the URL of the required
              screenshot appears in the "screenshot" attribute as the default screenshot. By
              default 5 static screenshots will be taken from different places in the video
              after transcoding. If the video is short, there may be fewer screenshots.

              Counting from 0. A value of -1 sets the default screenshot to the URL of your
              own image from the "poster" attribute.

              Look at "screenshot" attribute in GET /videos/{`video_id`} for details.

          share_url: Deprecated.

              Custom URL or iframe displayed in the link field when a user clicks on a sharing
              button in player. If empty, the link field and social network sharing is
              disabled

          source_bitrate_limit: The option allows you to set the video transcoding rule so that the output
              bitrate in ABR ladder is not exceeding the bitrate of the original video.

              This option is for advanced users only.

              By default `source_bitrate_limit: true` this option allows you to have the
              output bitrate not more than in the original video, thus to transcode video
              faster and to deliver it to end-viewers faster as well. At the same time, the
              quality will be similar to the original.

              If for some reason you need more byte-space in the output quality when encoding,
              you can set this option to `source_bitrate_limit: false`. Then, when
              transcoding, the quality ceiling will be raised from the bitrate of the original
              video to the maximum possible limit specified in our the Product Documentation.
              For example, this may be needed when:

              - to improve the visual quality parameters using PSNR, SSIM, VMAF metrics,
              - to improve the picture quality on dynamic scenes,
              - etc.

              The option is applied only at the video creation stage and cannot be changed
              later. If you want to re-transcode the video using new value, then you need to
              create and upload a new video only.

        Use this method to create a new video entity.

        **Methods of creating**

        To upload the original video file to the server, there are several possible
        scenarios:

        - **Copy from another server** – If your video is accessable via "http://",
          "https://", or "sftp://" public link, then you can use this method to copy a
          file from an external server. Set `origin_url` parameter with the link to the
          original video file (i.e. "https://domain.com/video.mp4"). After method
          execution file will be uploaded and will be sent to transcoding automatically,
          you don't have to do anything else. Use extra field `origin_http_headers` if
          authorization is required on the external server.

        - **Direct upload from a local device** – If you need to upload video directly
          from your local device or from a mobile app, then use this method. Keep
          `origin_url` empty and use TUS protocol ([tus.io](https://tus.io)) to upload
          file. More details are here
          ["Get TUS' upload"](/docs/api-reference/streaming/videos/get-tus-parameters-for-direct-upload)

        After getting the video, it is processed through the queue. There are 2 priority
        criteria: global and local. Global is determined automatically by the system as
        converters are ready to get next video, so your videos rarely queue longer than
        usual (when you don't have a dedicated region). Local priority works at the
        level of your account and you have full control over it, look at "priority"
        attribute.

        **AI processing**

        When uploading a video, it is possible to automatically create subtitles based
        on AI.

        Read more:

        - What is
          ["AI Speech Recognition"](/docs/api-reference/streaming/ai/create-ai-asr-task).
        - If the option is enabled via
          `auto_transcribe_audio_language: auto|<language_code>`, then immediately after
          successful transcoding, an AI task will be automatically created for
          transcription.
        - If you need to translate subtitles from original language to any other, then
          AI-task of subtitles translation can be applied. Use
          `auto_translate_subtitles_language: default|<language_codes,>` parameter for
          that. Also you can point several languages to translate to, then a separate
          subtitle will be generated for each specified language.
        - How to
          ["add AI-generated subtitles to an exist video"](/docs/api-reference/streaming/subtitles/add-subtitle).

        The created AI-task(s) will be automatically executed, and result will also be
        automatically attached to this video as subtitle(s).

        Please note that transcription is done automatically for all videos uploaded to
        our video hosting. If necessary, you can disable automatic creation of
        subtitles. If AI is disabled in your account, no AI functionality is called.

        **Advanced Features**

        For details on the requirements for incoming original files, and output video
        parameters after transcoding, refer to the Knowledge Base documentation. By
        default video will be transcoded according to the original resolution, and a
        quality ladder suitable for your original video will be applied. There is no
        automatic upscaling; the maximum quality is taken from the original video.

        If you want to upload specific files not explicitly listed in requirements or
        wish to modify the standard quality ladder (i.e. decrease quality or add new
        non-standard qualities), then such customization is possible. Please reach out
        to us for assistance.

        Additionally, check the Knowledge Base for any supplementary information you may
        need.

        Changes parameters of the video to new values.

        It's allowed to update only those public parameters that are described in POST
        method to create a new “video” entity. So it's not possible to change calculated
        parameters like "id", "duration", "`hls_url`", etc.

        Examples of changing:

        - Name: `{ "name": "new name of the video" }`
        - Move the video to a new directory: ` { "directory_id": 200 }`

        Please note that some parameters are used on initial step (before transcoding)
        only, so after transcoding there is no use in changing their values. For
        example, "`origin_url`" parameter is used for downloading an original file from
        a source and never used after transcoding; or "priority" parameter is used to
        set priority of processing and never used after transcoding.

        Args:
          name: Video name

          auto_transcribe_audio_language: Automatic creation of subtitles by transcribing the audio track.

              Values:

              - disable – Do not transcribe.
              - auto – Automatically detects the activation of the option based on the
                settings in your account. If generation is activated, then automatic language
                detection while transcribing.
              - \\  – Transcribe from specific language. Can be used to specify the exact
                language spoken in the audio track, or when auto language detection fails.
                Language is set by 3-letter language code according to ISO-639-2
                (bibliographic code). List of languages is available in `audio_language`
                attribute of API POST /streaming/ai/transcribe .

              Example:

              ```
              auto_transcribe_audio_language: "auto"
              auto_transcribe_audio_language: "ger"
              ```

              More details:

              - List of AI tasks – API
                [GET /streaming/ai/tasks](/docs/api-reference/streaming/ai/get-list-of-ai-tasks)
              - Add subtitles to an exist video – API
                [POST /streaming/videos/{`video_id`}/subtitles](/docs/api-reference/streaming/subtitles/add-subtitle).

          auto_translate_subtitles_language: Automatic translation of auto-transcribed subtitles to the specified
              language(s). Can be used both together with `auto_transcribe_audio_language`
              option only.

              Use it when you want to make automatic subtitles in languages other than the
              original language in audio.

              Values:

              - disable – Do not translate.
              - default – There are 3 default languages: eng,fre,ger
              - \\  – Explicit language to translate to, or list of languages separated by a
                comma. Look at list of available languages in description of AI ASR task
                creation.

              If several languages are specified for translation, a separate subtitle will be
              generated for each language.

              Example:

              ```
              auto_translate_subtitles_language: default
              auto_translate_subtitles_language: eng,fre,ger
              ```

              Please note that subtitle translation is done separately and after
              transcription. Thus separate AI-tasks are created for translation.

          client_user_id: Custom field where you can specify user ID in your system

          clip_duration_seconds: The length of the trimmed segment to transcode, instead of the entire length of
              the video. Is only used in conjunction with specifying the start of a segment.
              Transcoding duration is a number in seconds.

          clip_start_seconds: If you want to transcode only a trimmed segment of a video instead of entire
              length if the video, then you can provide timecodes of starting point and
              duration of a segment to process. Start encoding from is a number in seconds.

          custom_iframe_url: Deprecated.

              Custom URL of IFrame for video player to be used in share panel in player. Auto
              generated IFrame URL provided by default

          description: Video details; not visible to the end-users

          directory_id: ID of the directory where the video should be uploaded. (beta)

          origin_http_headers: Authorization HTTP request header. Will be used as credentials to authenticate a
              request to download a file (specified in "`origin_url`" parameter) on an
              external server.

              Syntax: `Authorization: <auth-scheme> <authorization-parameters>`

              Examples:

              - "`origin_http_headers`": "Authorization: Basic ..."
              - "`origin_http_headers`": "Authorization: Bearer ..."
              - "`origin_http_headers`": "Authorization: APIKey ..." Example of usage when
                downloading a file from Google Drive:

              ```
              POST https://api.gcore.com/streaming/videos

              "video": {
                "name": "IBC 2024 intro.mp4",
                "origin_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/...?alt=media",
                "origin_http_headers": "Authorization: Bearer ABC"
              }
              ```

          origin_url: URL to an original file which you want to copy from external storage. If
              specified, system will download the file and will use it as video source for
              transcoding.

          poster: Poster is your own static image which can be displayed before the video starts.

              After uploading the video, the system will automatically create several
              screenshots (they will be stored in "screenshots" attribute) from which you can
              select an default screenshot. This "poster" field is for uploading your own
              image. Also use attribute "`screenshot_id`" to select poster as a default
              screnshot.

              Attribute accepts single image as base64-encoded string
              [(RFC 2397 – The "data" URL scheme)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397). In
              format: `data:[<mediatype>];base64,<data>`

              MIME-types are image/jpeg, image/webp, and image/png and file sizes up to 1Mb.

              Examples:

              - `data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AA...qf/2Q==`
              - `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGg...ggg==`
              - `data:image/webp;base64,UklGRt.../DgAAAAA`

          priority: Priority allows you to adjust the urgency of processing some videos before
              others in your account, if your algorithm requires it. For example, when there
              are very urgent video and some regular ones that can wait in the queue.

              Value range, integer [-10..10]. -10 is the lowest down-priority, 10 is the
              highest up-priority. Default priority is 0.

          projection: Deprecated.

              Regulates the video format:

              - **regular** — plays the video as usual
              - **vr360** — plays the video in 360 degree mode
              - **vr180** — plays the video in 180 degree mode
              - **vr360tb** — plays the video in 3D 360 degree mode Top-Bottom.

              Default is regular

          quality_set_id: Custom quality set ID for transcoding, if transcoding is required according to
              your conditions. Look at GET /`quality_sets` method

          remote_poster_url: Poster URL to download from external resource, instead of uploading via "poster"
              attribute.

              It has the same restrictions as "poster" attribute.

          remove_poster: Set it to true to remove poster

          screenshot_id: Default screenshot index.

              Specify an ID from the "screenshots" array, so that the URL of the required
              screenshot appears in the "screenshot" attribute as the default screenshot. By
              default 5 static screenshots will be taken from different places in the video
              after transcoding. If the video is short, there may be fewer screenshots.

              Counting from 0. A value of -1 sets the default screenshot to the URL of your
              own image from the "poster" attribute.

              Look at "screenshot" attribute in GET /videos/{`video_id`} for details.

          share_url: Deprecated.

              Custom URL or iframe displayed in the link field when a user clicks on a sharing
              button in player. If empty, the link field and social network sharing is
              disabled

          source_bitrate_limit: The option allows you to set the video transcoding rule so that the output
              bitrate in ABR ladder is not exceeding the bitrate of the original video.

              This option is for advanced users only.

              By default `source_bitrate_limit: true` this option allows you to have the
              output bitrate not more than in the original video, thus to transcode video
              faster and to deliver it to end-viewers faster as well. At the same time, the
              quality will be similar to the original.

              If for some reason you need more byte-space in the output quality when encoding,
              you can set this option to `source_bitrate_limit: false`. Then, when
              transcoding, the quality ceiling will be raised from the bitrate of the original
              video to the maximum possible limit specified in our the Product Documentation.
              For example, this may be needed when:

              - to improve the visual quality parameters using PSNR, SSIM, VMAF metrics,
              - to improve the picture quality on dynamic scenes,
              - etc.

              The option is applied only at the video creation stage and cannot be changed
              later. If you want to re-transcode the video using new value, then you need to
              create and upload a new video only.

        An additional advantage is the ability to specify subtitles in the same request.
        Whereas for a normal single upload, subtitles are uploaded in separate requests.

        All videos in the request will be processed in queue in order of priority. Use
        "priority" attribute and look at general description in POST /videos method.

        Limits:

        - Batch max size = 500 videos.
        - Max body size (payload) = 64MB.
        - API connection timeout = 30 sec.
