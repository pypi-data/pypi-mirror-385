              - **`backblaze_bytes`** - Traffic in bytes from Backblaze origin.
              - **`total_bytes`** – `shield_bytes`, `upstream_bytes` and `sent_bytes`
                combined.
              - **`cdn_bytes`** – `sent_bytes` and `shield_bytes` combined.
              - **requests** – Number of requests to edge servers.
              - **`responses_2xx`** – Number of 2xx response codes.
              - **`responses_3xx`** – Number of 3xx response codes.
              - **`responses_4xx`** – Number of 4xx response codes.

              - **`responses_miss`** – Number of responses with the header Cache: MISS.
              - **`response_types`** – Statistics by content type. It returns a number of
                responses for content with different MIME types.
              - **`cache_hit_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: 1 - `upstream_bytes` / `sent_bytes`.
                We deduct the non-cached traffic from the total traffic amount.
              - **`cache_hit_requests_ratio`** – Formula: `responses_hit` / requests. The
                share of sending cached content.
              - **`shield_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: (`shield_bytes` - `upstream_bytes`) /

                is sent from the Origin Shielding than from the origin.
              - **`image_processed`** - Number of images transformed on the Image optimization
                service.
              - **`request_time`** - Time elapsed between the first bytes of a request were
                processed and logging after the last bytes were sent to a user.
              - **`upstream_response_time`** - Number of milliseconds it took to receive a
                response from an origin. If upstream `response_time_` contains several
                indications for one request (in case of more than 1 origin), we summarize
                them. In case of aggregating several queries, the average of this amount is
                calculated.
              - **`95_percentile`** - Represents the 95th percentile of network bandwidth
                usage in bytes per second. This means that 95% of the time, the network
                resource usage was below this value.
              - **`max_bandwidth`** - The maximum network bandwidth that was used during the
                selected time represented in bytes per second.
              - **`min_bandwidth`** - The minimum network bandwidth that was used during the

                response from an origin. If upstream `response_time_` contains several
                indications for one request (in case of more than 1 origin), we summarize
                them. In case of aggregating several queries, the average of this amount is
                calculated.

              separately from other metrics

              - **`backblaze_bytes`** - Traffic in bytes from Backblaze origin.
              - **`total_bytes`** – `shield_bytes`, `upstream_bytes` and `sent_bytes`
                combined.
              - **`cdn_bytes`** – `sent_bytes` and `shield_bytes` combined.
              - **requests** – Number of requests to edge servers.
              - **`responses_2xx`** – Number of 2xx response codes.
              - **`responses_3xx`** – Number of 3xx response codes.

              - **`responses_miss`** – Number of responses with the header Cache: MISS.
              - **`response_types`** – Statistics by content type. It returns a number of
                responses for content with different MIME types.
              - **`cache_hit_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: 1 - `upstream_bytes` / `sent_bytes`.
                We deduct the non-cached traffic from the total traffic amount.
              - **`cache_hit_requests_ratio`** – Formula: `responses_hit` / requests. The
                share of sending cached content.
              - **`shield_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: (`shield_bytes` - `upstream_bytes`) /

                is sent from the Origin Shielding than from the origin.

                response from an origin. If upstream `response_time_` contains several
                indications for one request (in case of more than 1 origin), we summarize
                them. In case of aggregating several queries, the average of this amount is
                calculated.
              - **`95_percentile`** - Represents the 95th percentile of network bandwidth
                usage in bytes per second. This means that 95% of the time, the network
                resource usage was below this value.
              - **`max_bandwidth`** - The maximum network bandwidth that was used during the

                combined.
              - **`cdn_bytes`** – `sent_bytes` and `shield_bytes` combined.

              - **`response_types`** – Statistics by content type. It returns a number of

              - **`cache_hit_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: 1 - `upstream_bytes` / `sent_bytes`.
                We deduct the non-cached traffic from the total traffic amount.
              - **`cache_hit_requests_ratio`** – Formula: `responses_hit` / requests. The
                share of sending cached content.
              - **`shield_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: (`shield_bytes` - `upstream_bytes`) /

                is sent from the Origin Shielding than from the origin.

              - **`upstream_response_time`** - Number of milliseconds it took to receive a
                response from an origin. If upstream `response_time_` contains several
                indications for one request (in case of more than 1 origin), we summarize
                them. In case of aggregating several queries, the average of this amount is
