      ~75% vs ~25% of requests.
    - `LEAST_CONNECTIONS`: Sends new connections to the member with fewest active
      connections, performing round-robin within groups of the same normalized load.
      Higher weight = allowed to hold more simultaneous connections before being
      considered 'more loaded'. Example: weights 2 vs 1 means 20 vs 10 active
      connections is treated as balanced.
    - `SOURCE_IP`: Routes clients consistently to the same member by hashing client
      source IP; hash result is modulo total weight of running members. Higher
      weight = more hash buckets, so more client IPs map to that member. Example:
      weights 2 vs 1 = roughly two-thirds of distinct client IPs map to the
      higher-weight member.
