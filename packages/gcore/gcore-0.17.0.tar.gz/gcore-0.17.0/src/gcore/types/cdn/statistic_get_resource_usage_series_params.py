    metrics: Required[str]

    Possible values:

    - **`upstream_bytes`** – Traffic in bytes from an origin server to CDN servers
      or to origin shielding when used.
    - **`sent_bytes`** – Traffic in bytes from CDN servers to clients.
    - **`shield_bytes`** – Traffic in bytes from origin shielding to CDN servers.
    - **`backblaze_bytes`** - Traffic in bytes from Backblaze origin.
    - **`total_bytes`** – `shield_bytes`, `upstream_bytes` and `sent_bytes`
      combined.
    - **`cdn_bytes`** – `sent_bytes` and `shield_bytes` combined.
    - **requests** – Number of requests to edge servers.
    - **`responses_2xx`** – Number of 2xx response codes.
    - **`responses_3xx`** – Number of 3xx response codes.
    - **`responses_4xx`** – Number of 4xx response codes.
    - **`responses_5xx`** – Number of 5xx response codes.
    - **`responses_hit`** – Number of responses with the header Cache: HIT.
    - **`responses_miss`** – Number of responses with the header Cache: MISS.
    - **`response_types`** – Statistics by content type. It returns a number of
      responses for content with different MIME types.
    - **`cache_hit_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: 1 - `upstream_bytes` / `sent_bytes`.
      We deduct the non-cached traffic from the total traffic amount.
    - **`cache_hit_requests_ratio`** – Formula: `responses_hit` / requests. The
      share of sending cached content.
    - **`shield_traffic_ratio`** – Formula: (`shield_bytes` - `upstream_bytes`) /
      `shield_bytes`. The efficiency of the Origin Shielding: how much more traffic
      is sent from the Origin Shielding than from the origin.
    - **`image_processed`** - Number of images transformed on the Image optimization
      service.
    - **`request_time`** - Time elapsed between the first bytes of a request were
      processed and logging after the last bytes were sent to a user.
    - **`upstream_response_time`** - Number of milliseconds it took to receive a
      response from an origin. If upstream `response_time_` contains several
      indications for one request (in case of more than 1 origin), we summarize
      them. In case of aggregating several queries, the average of this amount is
      calculated.

    Metrics **`upstream_response_time`** and **`request_time`** should be requested
    separately from other metrics
