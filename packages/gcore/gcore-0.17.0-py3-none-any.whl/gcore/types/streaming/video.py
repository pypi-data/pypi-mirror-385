    """

    mp4_url: Optional[str] = None
    """
    A URL to a rendition file of the specified quality in MP4 format for
    downloading.

    **Download methods**

    For each converted video, additional download endpoints are available under
    `converted_videos`/`mp4_urls`. An MP4 download enpoints:

    - /videos/{`client_id`}\\__{slug}/{filename}.mp4
    - /videos/{`client_id`}\\__{slug}/{filename}.mp4/download
    - /videos/{`client_id`}\\__{slug}/{filename}.mp4/download={`custom_filename`}

    The first option returns the file as is. Response will be:

    ```
      GET .mp4
      ...
      content-type: video/mp4
    ```

    The second option with /download will respond with HTTP response header that
    directly tells browsers to download the file instead of playing it in the
    browser:

    ```
      GET .mp4/download
      ...
      content-type: video/mp4
      content-disposition: attachment
      access-control-expose-headers: Content-Disposition
    ```

    The third option allows you to set a custom name for the file being downloaded.
    You can optionally specify a custom filename (just name excluding the .mp4
    extension) using the download= query.

    Filename constraints:

    - Length: 1-255 characters
    - Must NOT include the .mp4 extension (it is added automatically)
    - Allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \\__(underscore), -(dash), .(dot)
    - First character cannot be .(dot)
    - Example valid filenames: `holiday2025`, `_backup.final`, `clip-v1.2`

    ```
      GET .mp4/download={custom_filename}
      ...
      content-type: video/mp4
      content-disposition: attachment; filename="{custom_filename}.mp4"
      access-control-expose-headers: Content-Disposition
    ```

    Examples:

    - Video:
      `https://demo-public.gvideo.io/videos/2675_1OFgHZ1FWZNNvx1A/qid3567v1_h264_4050_1080.mp4/download`
    - Video with custom download filename:
      `https://demo-public.gvideo.io/videos/2675_1OFgHZ1FWZNNvx1A/qid3567v1_h264_4050_1080.mp4/download=highlights_v1.1_2025-05-30`

    **Default MP4 file name structure**

    Link to the file {filename} contains information about the encoding method using
    format: `<quality_version>_<codec>_<bitrate>_<height>.mp4`

    - `<quality_version>` – Internal quality identifier and file version. Please do
      not use it, can be changed at any time without any notice.
    - `<codec>` – Codec name that was used to encode the video, or audio codec if it
      is an audio-only file.
    - `<bitrate>` – Encoding bitrate in Kbps.
    - `<height>` – Video height, or word "audio" if it is an audio-only file.

    Note that this link format has been applied since 14.08.2024. If the video
    entity was uploaded earlier, links may have old simplified format.

    Example: `/videos/{client_id}_{slug}/qid3567v1_h264_4050_1080.mp4`

    **Dynamic speed limiting** This mode sets different limits for different users
    or for different types of content. The speed is adjusted based on requests with
    the “speed” and “buffer” arguments.

    Example: `?speed=50k&buffer=500k`

    Read more in Product Documentation in CDN section "Network limits".

    **Secure token authentication (updated)**

    Access to MP4 download links can be protected using secure tokens passed as
    query parameters. The token generation logic has been updated to allow
    fine-grained protection per file and bitrate.

    Token generation uses the entire MP4 path, which ensures the token only grants
    access to a specific quality/version of the video. This prevents unintended
    access to other bitrate versions of an ABR stream.

    Token Query Parameters:

    - token: The generated hash
    - expires: Expiration timestamp
    - speed: (optional) Speed limit in bytes/sec, or empty string
    - buffer: (optional) Buffer size in bytes, or empty string

    Optional (for IP-bound tokens):

    - ip: The user’s IP address Example:
      `?md5=QX39c77lbQKvYgMMAvpyMQ&expires=1743167062`
