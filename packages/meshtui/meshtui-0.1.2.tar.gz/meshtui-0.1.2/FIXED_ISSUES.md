# Fixed Issues Summary

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### 1. Async Errors While Connecting - FIXED
**Problem:** Un-awaited coroutine warnings and async errors during connection
**Solution:** 
- Fixed event handler registration - meshcore.subscribe properly handles async callbacks
- Removed blocking message fetching loops that caused hangs
- Event-driven architecture using proper async event handlers

### 2. Contacts Window Not Populated - FIXED
**Problem:** Contacts list was empty even when contacts existed
**Solution:**
- Fixed event type: Changed from `CONTACT_UPDATE` to `CONTACTS`
- Fixed payload parsing: Use `adv_name` field from contact data
- Handle both dict and list payloads from meshcore
- Properly normalize contact data structure
- Enable `auto_update_contacts` on meshcore instance

**Result:** Contacts now populate correctly with proper names (tested: "Andrath t114", "Marienstein Room")

### 3. Application Hangs - FIXED
**Problem:** Application would freeze/hang during operation
**Solution:**
- Removed blocking message fetching that prevented event loop from running
- Used event-driven approach with proper async handlers
- Fixed event subscription to use async callbacks correctly
- Improved disconnect logic to allow time for event cleanup

**Result:** Application runs smoothly without hanging

### 4. EventDispatcher Task Warnings (Known Issue)
**Issue:** You may see these warnings in logs:
```
ERROR:asyncio:Task was destroyed but it is pending!
task: <Task pending name='Task-XX' coro=<EventDispatcher._process_events()...
```

**Explanation:** This is a bug in the meshcore library itself (in `meshcore/events.py:150`). The EventDispatcher doesn't properly clean up its background tasks when the connection closes.

**Impact:** These are harmless warnings that don't affect functionality. The app works correctly despite these messages.

**Workaround:** Added 0.2s delay before deleting meshcore instance to minimize warnings. Full fix requires upstream meshcore library update.

## Verification

Tested with:
```bash
python test_connection.py
```

Results:
- ✅ Connects successfully to /dev/ttyUSB0
- ✅ 2 contacts found with correct names
- ✅ 1 channel found
- ✅ No application hangs
- ✅ Event handlers working correctly
- ⚠️ EventDispatcher warnings appear (meshcore library issue, not functional problem)

## Files Modified

1. `src/meshtui/connection.py`
   - Fixed CONTACTS event subscription
   - Fixed contact payload parsing (adv_name field)
   - Removed blocking message fetch
   - Added proper async event handlers
   - Improved disconnect with cleanup delay

2. `src/meshtui/app.py`
   - Added proper quit action override
   - Improved shutdown sequence

3. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
   - Created comprehensive coding guidelines

## Next Steps

The application is now functional. The EventDispatcher warnings are cosmetic and don't affect operation. If desired, you could:
1. Report the EventDispatcher cleanup issue to the meshcore project
2. Suppress asyncio task warnings in logging configuration
3. Continue using the app - warnings can be ignored
