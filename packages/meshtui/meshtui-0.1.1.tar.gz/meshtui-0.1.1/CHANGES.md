# MeshTUI Changelog

## Version 0.1.1 (2025-10-20)

### Documentation Updates
- **Installation**: Updated documentation to prominently feature `pipx` as the recommended installation method
- **Development**: Added standard Python `venv` and `pip` workflow alongside `uv` alternatives
- **Accessibility**: Made project more accessible to developers who don't use `uv`
- **README.md**: Updated PyPI Installation, Development Installation, and Development sections
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated Environment Setup and Package Management sections with `pipx` examples

### Why this update?
- `pipx` is the standard tool for installing Python CLI applications with proper dependency isolation
- Documentation now covers the full spectrum: end users (pipx), power users (uv tool), and developers (standard venv/pip or uv)

## Version 0.1.0 (2025-10-20)

### Channel Creation UI
- **Feature**: Create custom encrypted channels directly from the UI
- **UI Element**: "+" button next to Channels header
- **Auto-hash Support**: Use # prefix (e.g., #mychannel) for automatic secret generation
- **Channel Slots**: Support for channels 1-7 (0 is reserved for Public)
- **Modal Dialog**: User-friendly creation dialog with validation

- Better error handling and validation in channel creation

### Technical Implementation
- Added `create_channel()` method to connection manager
- Added `refresh()` method to ChannelManager
- Channel selection now properly extracts channel index
- Database queries use "Channel X" format for consistency
- Mark messages as read immediately after sending

### Module Changes

## Previous Updates (2025-10-20)

### Message Delivery Tracking and Retry Logic
- **Feature**: Comprehensive delivery tracking for direct messages
- **ACK Tracking**: Monitor repeater acknowledgments with "✓ Heard X repeats"
- **Timeout Detection**: Automatic failure detection with "✗ Delivery failed (no repeaters)"
- **Automatic Retry**: Messages retry up to 3 times with intelligent flood routing fallback
- **Database Tracking**: All delivery information stored for later analysis
  - `ack_code` - Unique acknowledgment code
  - `delivery_status` - 'sent', 'repeated', 'failed', or 'broadcast'
  - `repeat_count` - Number of repeater ACKs
  - `last_ack_time` - Timestamp of last ACK
- **UI Improvements**: Messages displayed immediately, status appears after
- **Channel Support**: Channel messages show "✓ Sent (broadcast)" (no ACK per API)

### Technical Implementation
- Added `_pending_acks` dictionary to track message ACKs
- Implemented `_handle_ack()` event handler for ACK events
- Added `_check_message_timeout()` for timeout-based failure detection
- Updated `ContactManager.send_message()` to use `send_msg_with_retry()`
- Modified database schema to include delivery tracking fields
- Added `update_message_delivery_status()` method to database
- Fixed message display order (message first, then status notifications)

### Module Changes
- `src/meshtui/connection.py` - ACK tracking, retry logic, timeout detection
- `src/meshtui/contact.py` - Automatic retry with flood routing
- `src/meshtui/channel.py` - Extract ACK codes (though not used for broadcasts)
- `src/meshtui/database.py` - New delivery tracking fields and update method
- `src/meshtui/app.py` - Immediate message display for contacts and channels

### API Limitations Addressed
- Channel broadcasts don't support ACK tracking (per MeshCore Python API design)
- Direct messages get full ACK tracking via `send_msg_with_retry()`
- Automatic fallback to flood routing after 2 failed attempts

## Previous Updates (2025-01-19)

### Per-Device Database Implementation
- **Feature**: Each connected device now gets its own database file
- **Location**: `~/.config/meshtui/devices/{device_pubkey[:16]}.db`
- **Benefit**: Prevents data collision when switching between different devices
- **Automatic**: Database is initialized after connection using device public key
- **Backward Compatible**: Legacy `meshtui.db` remains for reference

### Room Messaging Fix
- **Issue**: Room messages from other users were not appearing in real-time
- **Root Cause**: Database query was filtering out messages from other room participants
- **Fix**: Simplified room message query to show ALL messages to/from room
- **Result**: Room conversations now display messages from all participants in real-time

### Technical Improvements
- Added `_initialize_device_database()` method in connection.py
- Database initialization moved to post-connection phase
- Added safety checks for all database operations (`if self.db:`)
- Updated all three connection methods (BLE, Serial, TCP)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing installations

## Recent Refactoring (Previous)

### Modular Architecture
- **Split into focused modules** for better maintainability
- **transport.py** - BLE, Serial, TCP connection handling
- **contact.py** - ContactManager for node/contact operations
- **channel.py** - ChannelManager for channel messaging
- **room.py** - RoomManager for room server authentication

### Features Added
- ✅ **Room server support** - Automatic detection and password login
- ✅ **Queued message retrieval** - Fetches messages after room login
- ✅ **Public channel messaging** - Send to channel 0 (public)
- ✅ **Node type detection** - Companion, Repeater, Room, Sensor
- ✅ **Contact-based chat** - Direct messaging to contacts
- ✅ **Channel selection** - Join and message channels
- ✅ **Message history** - View past conversations

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each module has one job
2. **Easier Testing** - Test managers independently
3. **Better Maintainability** - Smaller, focused files
4. **Cleaner Code** - No 1000-line files!
