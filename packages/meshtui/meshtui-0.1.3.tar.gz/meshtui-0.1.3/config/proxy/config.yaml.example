# MeshCore TCP Proxy Configuration Example

proxy:
  # TCP server listen address (0.0.0.0 = all interfaces, 127.0.0.1 = localhost only)
  listen_host: 0.0.0.0

  # TCP server listen port
  listen_port: 5000

  # Maximum number of concurrent clients (0 = unlimited)
  max_clients: 5

backend:
  # Backend type: 'serial' or 'ble'
  type: serial

  # Serial backend configuration
  serial_port: /dev/ttyUSB0
  baudrate: 115200

  # BLE backend configuration (alternative to serial)
  # Uncomment and configure if using BLE backend:
  # ble_address: "C2:2B:A1:D5:3E:B6"

  # Auto-reconnect on disconnect
  auto_reconnect: true

  # Delay between reconnect attempts (seconds)
  reconnect_delay: 5

  # Maximum reconnect attempts (0 = infinite)
  max_reconnect_attempts: 0

logging:
  # Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  level: INFO

  # Log file path (leave empty or null for stdout only)
  file: null

  # Log frame data (verbose, for debugging only)
  log_frames: false
