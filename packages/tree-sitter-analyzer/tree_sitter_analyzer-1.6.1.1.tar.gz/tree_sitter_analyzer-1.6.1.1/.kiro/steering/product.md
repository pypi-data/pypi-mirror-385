# Product Overview

## What is Tree-sitter Analyzer?

Tree-sitter Analyzer is a revolutionary code analysis tool designed specifically for the AI era. It solves the fundamental problem of LLM token limits when analyzing large code files.

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: Large code files (>10K lines) exceed LLM token limits, making AI-assisted code analysis impossible or inefficient.

**Solution**: Smart code analysis that provides:
- Code structure overview without reading entire files
- Precise line-range extraction of code sections
- Accurate positioning data for code operations
- Native AI assistant integration via MCP protocol

## Target Users

1. **AI Assistant Users**: Developers using Claude Desktop, Cursor, Roo Code, and other AI IDEs
2. **CLI Users**: Developers who prefer command-line tools for code analysis
3. **Enterprise Teams**: Organizations dealing with large codebases and AI-assisted development

## Key Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript (full), C/C++/Rust/Go (basic)
- **Three-step Workflow**: Scale check → Structure analysis → Code extraction
- **MCP Integration**: Native support for Model Context Protocol
- **Enterprise Quality**: 1,358 tests, 74.54% coverage, cross-platform compatibility

## Current Version

v0.9.4 - Latest stable release with comprehensive MCP support and enhanced security features.
