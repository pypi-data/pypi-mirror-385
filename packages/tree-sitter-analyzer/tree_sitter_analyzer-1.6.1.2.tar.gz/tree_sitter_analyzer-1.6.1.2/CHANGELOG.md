## [1.4.1] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **🐛 find_and_grep File Search Scope Bug**: Fixed critical bug where ripgrep searched in parent directories instead of only in files found by fd
  - **Root Cause**: Tool was using parent directories as search roots, causing broader search scope than intended
  - **Solution**: Now uses specific file globs to limit ripgrep search to exact files discovered by fd
  - **Impact**: Ensures `searched_file_count` and `total_files` metrics are consistent and accurate
  - **Example**: When fd finds 7 files matching `*pattern*`, ripgrep now only searches those 7 files, not all files in their parent directories

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: `tree_sitter_analyzer/mcp/tools/find_and_grep_tool.py`
- **Test Coverage**: All 1797 tests pass, including 144 fd/rg tool tests
- **Quality Metrics**: 74.45% code coverage maintained
- **Breaking Changes**: None - fix improves accuracy without changing API

This patch release resolves a significant accuracy issue in the find_and_grep tool,
ensuring search results match user expectations and tool documentation.

  - Same file matches are now grouped together instead of repeated entries
  - Context consumption reduced by ~80% for multi-file searches
  - Better organization for AI assistants processing search results
- **🔧 MCP Tool Enhancement**: `SearchContentTool` now supports efficient file grouping
- **💡 User Experience**: Cleaner, more organized search result structure

### Technical Details
- **Issue**: Search results showed same file paths repeatedly, causing context overflow
- **Solution**: Implemented `group_by_file` option with file-based grouping logic
- **Impact**: Dramatically reduces token usage while maintaining all match information
- **Files Modified**:
  - `tree_sitter_analyzer/mcp/tools/search_content_tool.py` - Added group_by_file processing

- **🎯 File Filtering**: Added glob pattern filtering to restrict search scope to exactly the files specified in the `files` parameter
- **🛡️ Special Character Handling**: Properly escape special characters in filenames for glob pattern matching

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: When using `files` parameter, the tool was extracting parent directories as search roots but not filtering the search to only the specified files
- **Solution**: Added file-specific glob patterns to `include_globs` parameter to restrict ripgrep search scope
- **Impact**: `search_content` tool now correctly searches only the files specified in the `files` parameter
- **Files Modified**: `tree_sitter_analyzer/mcp/tools/search_content_tool.py`

This hotfix resolves a critical bug that was causing incorrect search results when using the `files` parameter in the `search_content` tool.

## [0.9.4] - 2025-08-15

### 🔧 Fixed (MCP)
- Unified relative path resolution: In MCP's `read_partial_tool`, `table_format_tool`, and the `check_code_scale` path handling in `server`, all relative paths are now consistently resolved to absolute paths based on `project_root` before security validation and file reading. This prevents boundary misjudgments and false "file not found" errors.
- Fixed boolean evaluation: Corrected the issue where the tuple returned by `validate_file_path` was directly used as a boolean. Now, the boolean value and error message are unpacked and used appropriately.

### 📚 Docs
- Added and emphasized in contribution and collaboration docs: Always use `uv run` to execute commands locally (including on Windows/PowerShell).
- Replaced example commands from plain `pytest`/`python` to `uv run pytest`/`uv run python`.

### 🧪 Tests
- All MCP-related tests (tools, resources, server) passed.
