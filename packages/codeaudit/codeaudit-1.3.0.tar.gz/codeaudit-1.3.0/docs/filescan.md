# Command `codeaudit filescan`

The **Python Code Audit** `filescan` command efficiently scans Python files or directories (packages) to identify and report potential security weaknesses.

It produces a report detailing the potential security issues discovered.


See section [validations](checksinformation) for all security checks implemented!


To use the `codescan filescan` feature type in the console:

```
codeaudit filescan <INPUTFILE>  [OUTPUTFILE]
```

The `<INPUTFILE>` is mandatory. **Python Code Audit** will create a detailed security scan report. 


If you do not specify [OUTPUTFILE], a HTML output file, a HTML report file is created in the current directory and will be named codeaudit-report.html.

When running `codeaudit filescan` detailed information is determined for a Python file or package based on more than 70 validations implemented.

The `filescan` report lists all identified security weaknesses that could lead to a security vulnerability.

Per line a the in construct that can cause a security risks is shown, along with the relevant code lines where the issue is detected.
