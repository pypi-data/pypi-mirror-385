# Python Code Audit APIs

The **Python Code Audit** APIs make it easy to build your own tools and integrations, such as:


* **Reporting dashboard**: Easily create custom dashboards using the APIs. Audit scan results can be exported to a human-readable JSON file for analysis and visualization.

* **Statistical Analysis**:
Use the APIs to identify and study common Python security weaknesses across multiple packages within your organization.


* **CI/CD Integration**:
Integrate the APIs into your continuous integration and deployment pipelines — even when using remote source control systems like `GitHub.com`, `GitLab.com`, `https://codeberg.org/` or https://notabug.org/ and many others!

We’ve provided a few simple examples to demonstrate how to use the APIs effectively.
