# Security and Reporting Security Issues

The security of this Python Code Audit tool is top priority!

Python Code Audit is a tool designed to find security issues, so we do everything possible to make sure this tool itself is free of possible security issues.

All our code is reviewed in depth from a security point of view. Use of the Python Code Audit tool should be without any risks for all users!

I and the community around this project take security issues in this tool very seriously.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your finding, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contribution.


To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/nocomplexity/codeaudit/security/advisories/new) tab.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
