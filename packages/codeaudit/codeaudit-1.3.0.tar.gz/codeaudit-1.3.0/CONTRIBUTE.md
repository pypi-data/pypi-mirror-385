The **Codeaudit** code repository is hosted at [Github](github.com/nocomplexity/codeaudit).

Simple Guidelines:

* Questions, Feature Requests, Bug Reports should all be reported on the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nocomplexity/codeaudit/issues) .
* [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is used for code style. But for a simple fix, using `Black` is not required!

This codeaudit tool is designed by applying [Zero Complexity By Design principles](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/0complexity/abstract.html). So the goal is to keep the tool simple to use and the code simple to adjust or to extend.

:::{warning}
This simple tool is designed to be simple to use and maintain.
