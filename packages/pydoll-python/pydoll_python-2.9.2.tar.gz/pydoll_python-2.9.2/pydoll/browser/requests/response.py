class Response:
    """HTTP response object for browser-based fetch requests.

    This class provides a standardized interface for handling HTTP responses
    obtained through the browser's fetch API. It mimics the requests.Response
    interface while preserving all browser-specific metadata including cookies,
    headers, and network timing information.

    Key Features:
    - Compatible with requests.Response API for easy migration
    - Preserves both request and response headers for analysis
    - Automatic cookie extraction from Set-Cookie headers
    - Lazy JSON parsing with caching
    - Browser-context aware (respects CORS, security policies)
    - Content available in multiple formats (text, bytes, JSON)

    The response contains all data captured during the browser's fetch execution,
    including redirects, authentication flows, and any browser-applied transformations.
