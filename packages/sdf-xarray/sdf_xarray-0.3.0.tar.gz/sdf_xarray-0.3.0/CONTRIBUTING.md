# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the BEAM ecosystem! Whether it's reporting issues,
suggesting features, improving the documentation, or submitting pull requests,
your input helps improve these tools for the community.

## How to Contribute

There are many ways to get involved:

- **Report bugs** - Found something not working as expected? Open an issue
  with as much detail as possible.
- **Request a feature** - Got an idea for a new feature or enhancement?
  Open a feature request on
  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/epochpic/sdf-xarray/issues).
- **Improve the documentation** - If something is missing or unclear, feel free
  to suggest edits or open a pull request.
- **Submit code changes** - Bug fixes, refactoring, and new features are
  all welcome.

## Code

### Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and use the
following tools:

- [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for formatting
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for sorting imports

To run these tools locally, install the optional dependencies and run:

```bash
pip install "sdf-xarray[lint]"
ruff check src tests
```

### Running and Adding Tests

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to run tests.
All new functionality should include relevant tests, placed in the `tests/`
directory and following the existing structure.

Before submitting code changes, ensure that all tests pass:

```bash
pip install "sdf-xarray[test]"
pytest
```

## Documentation

### Style

When contributing to the documentation:

- Wrap lines at 80 characters.
- Follow the format of existing `.rst` files.
- Link to external functions or tools when possible.

### Compiling and Adding Documentation

To build the documentation locally, first install the required packages:

```bash
pip install "sdf-xarray[docs]"
cd docs
make html
```

The documentation can be updated by changing any of the `*.rst` files located
in the main `docs` directory. The existing documentation hopefully includes most
of the snippets you'd need to write or update it, however if you are stuck
please don't hesitate to reach out.

Every time you make changes to the documentation or add a new page, you must
re-run the `make html` command to regenerate the HTML files.

### Previewing Documentation

#### Using VS Code Extensions

Once the html web pages have been made you can review them installing the
[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
VS Code extension. Navigate to the `_build/html` folder, right-click the
`index.html`, and select **"Open with Live Server"**. This
will open a live preview of the documentation in your web browser.

#### Using a Simple Python Server

Alternatively, if you're not using VS Code, you can start a simple local server with Python:

```bash
python -m http.server -d _build/htm
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view the documentation.

## Continuous Integration

All pull requests are automatically checked using GitHub Actions for:

- Linting (`ruff`)
- Formatting (`black` and `isort`)
- Testing (`pytest`)

These checks must pass before a pull request can be merged.
