# Buff
## Background
We are in an era where data fuels everything we do and eberything we use. However, for the everday person, accessing unbiased data regarding socioeconomics can be diffucult. You may need to navigate the web for sources and figure out their specific formats to even find the data, let alone having the prowess of understanding what is in front of you. This is a humungous barrier that is inexcusable and needs to be addressed. 

## Purpose
A data analysis project based around making socioeconmic data more accessible. Despite there being no barrier to entry for Census data, to access it, it can be incredibly confusing given the structure of how the data is accessed -- groups, variables, etc -- making it hard to access for some people. Therefore, I present a Buff, a generalization of the work done at  [Capital Region Indicators](https://www.capitalregionindicators.org/) such that any location in the United States can have their Census data displayed in an intuitive and easily digestible manner. 

## Featuring
### In-progress
### Census Pipeline
To gather the data necessary for this project, I will be creating a pipeline that takes the data from the Census dynamically and can be accessed for easy use for others.

### Data Display
Similarly to Capital Region Indicators, I will provide an interface where users can choose locations in the United States at the City, County, or State level and recieve statistics and related visualizations. The hope here is that the data you often here about on the news is there for you to confirm or refute proposed claims and easily come to these conclusions.

### Similarity Analysis
Atop of the data access and visualizations, I believe it will be beneficial for users to compare cities, counties, and states across the United States. I hope here this can provide a clean understanding of similar places across the nation despite their physical distance. I believe this can also be used as a way to determine what cities you may want to live in.

### Long-term goals
1. Web application
2. More data!
