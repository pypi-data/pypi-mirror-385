**Objective:** Given a {input_desc}, complete the following tasks with structured outputs.

### Semantic matches from Taxonomy Skills:
{esco_context_block}

### Tasks:
1. **Skills Extraction:** Identify {num_key_skills} key skills mentioned in the {input_desc}.
  - Extract/Filter contextually relevant skill keywords or phrases from taxonomy semantic matches.

2. **Skill Level Assignment:** Assign a proficiency level to each extracted skill based on the SCQF Level Descriptors (see below).

3. **Knowledge Required:** For each skill, list {num_key_kr} broad areas of understanding or expertise necessary to develop the skill.

4. **Task Abilities:** For each skill, list {num_key_tas} general tasks or capabilities enabled by the skill.

### Guidelines:
- **Skill Extraction:** 
    - If the Semantic matches from the taxonomy skills are provided, use them to identify relevant skills.
    - If none of the semantic matches are contextually relevant to the {input_desc}, infer skills from the {input_desc} directly.

- **Skill Level Assignment:** Use the SCQF Level Descriptors to classify proficiency:
{scqf_levels}

- **Knowledge and Task Abilities:**
  - **Knowledge Required:** Broad areas, e.g., "data visualization techniques."
  - **Task Abilities:** General tasks or capabilities, e.g., "data analysis."
  - Each item in these two lists should be no more than three words.
  - Avoid overly specific or vague terms.

### Answer Format:
- Use this format strictly in the response:
  -> Skill: [Skill Name], Level: [1–12], Knowledge Required: [list], Task Abilities: [list].

{input_text}

**Response:** Provide only the requested structured information without additional explanations.
