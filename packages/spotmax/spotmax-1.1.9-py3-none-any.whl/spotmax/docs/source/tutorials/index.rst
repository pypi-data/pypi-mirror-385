Tutorials
=========

The tutorials presented here describe how to run SpotMAX with real-world 
data. We will setup the paramters using the GUI and we will run the analysis in 
the terminal. 

If you prefer to run SpotMAX in your own pipeline see the notebooks 
`here <https://github.com/ElpadoCan/SpotMAX/tree/main/examples/notebooks>`_. 

.. note::

   While it appears that the tutorials are application-specific, SpotMAX can detect 
   globular-like spots in **any fluorescence microscopy dataset**. The concepts 
   explained in the tutorials can in fact be applied in many other situations.
