3. **Update conda** by running the following command:
    
    .. code-block:: 
    
        conda update conda
    
    This will update all packages that are part of conda.

4. **Create a virtual environment** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        conda create -n acdc python=3.10

    This will create a virtual environment, which is an **isolated folder** 
    where the required libraries will be installed. 
    The virtual environment is called ``acdc`` in this case.

5. **Activate the virtual environment** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        conda activate acdc
    
    This will activate the environment and the terminal will know where to 
    install packages. 
    If the activation of the environment was successful, this should be 
    indicated to the left of the active path (you should see ``(acdc)`` 
    before the path).

    .. important:: 

       Before moving to the next steps make sure that you always activate 
       the ``acdc`` environment. If you close the terminal and reopen it, 
       always run the command ``conda activate acdc`` before installing any 
       package. To know whether the right environment is active, the line 
       on the terminal where you type commands should start with the text 
       ``(acdc)``, like in this screenshot:

       .. tabs::

            .. tab:: Windows

                .. figure:: ../images/conda_activate_acdc_windows.png
                    :width: 100%

                    with the command ``conda activate acdc``.
            
            .. tab:: macOS

                    :width: 100%

                    with the command ``conda activate acdc``.

6. **Update pip** with the following command:
   
    .. code-block:: 
   
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    
    While we could use conda to install packages, SpotMAX is not available 
    on conda yet, hence we will use ``pip``. 
    Pip the default package manager for Python. Here we are updating pip itself.
