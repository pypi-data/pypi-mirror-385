            Hi there, I'm the SpotMAX bot :wave:. 
            This issue had no activity for more than 180 days. 
            For now, we have marked it as "inactive" until there is some
            new activity. If this issue was not solved yet, unfortunately 
            we haven't had the time to implement it or it requires more discussion. 
            Note that it doesn't mean it has been ignored, but a little reminder 
            from your side would help :D. 
            Feel free to reach out to us here or on our
            [forum](https://github.com/SchmollerLab/Cell_ACDC/discussions).
            If you think that this issue is no longer relevant, 
            you may close it by yourself.
            In any case, we apologise for the inconvenience and we thank you 
            for your patience and contributions so far!
