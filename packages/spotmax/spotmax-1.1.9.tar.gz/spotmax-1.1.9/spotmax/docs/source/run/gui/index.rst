Run SpotMAX from the GUI
========================

SpotMAX GUI is based on the `Cell-ACDC`_ GUI and it can be launched from the 
Cell-ACDC launcher. If SpotMAX and Cell-ACDC are correctly installed, run the 
command ``acdc`` to open the launcher. From the launcher, you can open SpotMAX 
GUI by clicking on ``4. Launch SpotMAX...`` button, as shown in the screenshot below.

If you already have some image data, you will first need to structure it into 
the folder structure required by Cell-ACDC. For a quick test, you can let Cell-ACDC 
create a folder structure for you by opening the main Cell-ACDC GUI (see module 3 
in the screenshot above). Next, click on the menu ``File`` and then 
``Open Image/Video file...`` on the top menubar. 

.. tip:: 

    If you plan on using SpotMAX extensively, we recommend always structuring 
    the data into the required structure. See here for more information 
    `Create Cell-ACDC folder structure`_.

If you already have some image data structured into the Cell-ACDC folder structure, 
you can click on the menu ``File`` and then ``Load folder...`` on the top menubar 
to load the data into the GUI. 

If you don't have any data yet, you can download some test data from here 
`Example data SpotMAX GUI`_. Unzip it and load the "Position_16" sub-folder 
into the GUI as described above. Once you are asked about the channel to load, 
load the "mNeon" channel (spots channel, i.e., mitochondrial DNA nucleoids).

The test data folder also contains a configuration file for the analysis paramters. 
To load the analysis parameters, click on the "Load parameters from previous analysis..." 
button on the top-left corner of the GUI. Next, select the 
``mito_mtDNA_yeast/SpotMAX_test_gui_example_parameters.ini`` file from the 
test data folder. On the warning about the metadata, click on 
``Load metadata from the parameters file``. 

If you also have the analysis parameters loaded or set up, you can start the 
analysis by clicking on the "Run analysis..." button (see screenshot below). 
Additionally, you can also test and visualize the effect of some of the 
parameters by clicking on the "Compute" button beside the parameter.

When you have data loaded into the GUI you can focus your attention on the 
three tabs on the top-left corner of the GUI. See the screenshot below.
