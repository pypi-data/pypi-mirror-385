1. Install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ or `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/index.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links>`_ 
    Anaconda is the standard **package manager** for Python in the scientific 
    community. It comes with a GUI for user-friendly package installation 
    and management. However, here we describe its use through the terminal. 
    Miniconda is a lightweight implementation of Anaconda without the GUI.

2. Open a **terminal**
    Roughly speaking, a terminal is a **text-based way to run instructions**. 
    On Windows, use the **Anaconda prompt**, you can find it by searching for it. 
    On macOS or Linux you can use the default Terminal.
