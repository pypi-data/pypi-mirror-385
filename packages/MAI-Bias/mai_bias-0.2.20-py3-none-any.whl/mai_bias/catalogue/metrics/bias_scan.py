    """<p>This module scans your dataset to estimate the most biased attributes or combinations of attributes.
    You can use those as inputs to other modules.
    For example, gender may only show bias when combined with socioeconomic status, despite the latter not
    bein inherently sensitive. If you have already marked some
    attributes as sensitive (such as race or gender), the module will **exclude** them from the scan. This allows
    searching for additional patterns that contribute to unfair outcomes.</p>

    <p>A paper describing how this approach estimates biased intersection candidates in **linear** rather
    than **exponential** time is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08292">here</a>. Instead of checking
    every possible combination (which can be very time-consuming), it uses a more efficient method.</p>

    <p>To get started, run the module without setting any sensitive attributes. After the first scan,
    advanced users can review the results and mark any problematic attributes it identifies as sensitive.
    Then, run the scan again to uncover additional potential issues—these may be less prominent but still
    worth investigating.</p>

    <p>For convenience, there is a <i>discovery</i> mode available in the parameters. This automatically adds
    attributes suspected of contributing to bias to the list of ignored (already known sensitive) ones, then reruns
    the scan. While this automation helps streamline the process, it removes all attributes contributing to biased
    intersections. A domain expert may prefer to manually remove one attribute at a time by adding it to known
    sensitive attributes and rerun the module to investigate more granular effects on the results.</p>

    Args:
        penalty: A positive. The higher the penalty, the less complex the highest scoring subset that gets returned is, but penalties as small as 1.E-12 could also be acceptable to promote finding intersections of many attributes.
        scoring: The distribution used to compute p-values. Can be Bernoulli, Gaussian, Poisson, or BerkJones.
        discovery: Whether the scan should attempt to create a list of problematic attribute combinations in decreasing order of importance. That list will contain only non-overlapping attribute intersections.

                <p>After scanning for imbalances, the following attribute combinations out of those that were

                Not all found attributes should necessarily be protected, and you can simplify the problem setting
