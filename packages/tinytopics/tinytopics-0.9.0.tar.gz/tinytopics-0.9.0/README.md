Topic modeling via sum-to-one constrained neural Poisson NMF.
Built with PyTorch, runs on both CPUs and GPUs.

## Installation

### Using pip

You can install tinytopics from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tinytopics
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanxstats/tinytopics.git
cd tinytopics
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Install PyTorch with GPU support

The above will likely install the CPU version of PyTorch by default.
To install PyTorch with GPU support, follow the
[official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

For example, install PyTorch for Windows with CUDA 12.6:

```bash
pip uninstall torch
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

### Install alternative PyTorch versions

For users stuck with older PyTorch or NumPy versions, for instance, in HPC
cluster settings, a workaround is to skip installing the dependencies with
`--no-deps` and install specific versions of all dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install tinytopics --no-deps
pip install torch==2.2.0
```

### Use tinytopics in a project

To have a more hassle-free package management experience, it is recommended
to use tinytopics as a dependency under a project context using
virtual environments.

You should probably set up a manual source/index for PyTorch.
As examples, check out the official guidelines when
[using Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/faq/#how-do-i-install-pytorch) or
[using uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/).
