# Claude Task Worker - Changelog

## 2025-10-19 - Automatic Task Notes Feature

### 🎉 New Features

#### Automatic Task Note Tracking
Both scripts now automatically add timestamped notes to tasks using `uv run anyt task note`, creating a complete audit trail of Claude's work.

**Added notes for:**
- ✅ Task start (when Claude begins working)
- ✅ Task completion (with summary of what was done)
- ✅ Task errors (if Claude encounters issues)

### 📝 Changes Made

#### `claude_task_worker_simple.sh`
1. **Start Note**: Added note when task status changes to "inprogress"
   ```bash
   uv run anyt task note "$TASK_ID" --message "🤖 Claude started working on this task"
   ```

2. **Completion Note**: Captures Claude's output and adds summary to task
   ```bash
   SUMMARY=$(echo "$CLAUDE_OUTPUT" | head -c 500)
   uv run anyt task note "$TASK_ID" --message "✅ Claude completed work: $SUMMARY"
   ```

3. **Error Note**: Adds note if Claude fails
   ```bash
   uv run anyt task note "$TASK_ID" --message "❌ Claude encountered an error during execution"
   ```

#### `claude_task_worker.sh`
1. **Start Note**: Added with "(automated worker)" label
   ```bash
   uv run anyt task note "$task_id" --message "🤖 Claude started working on this task (automated worker)"
   ```

2. **Completion Note**: Logs and adds summary to task
   ```bash
   summary=$(echo "$claude_response" | head -c 500)
   uv run anyt task note "$task_id" --message "✅ Claude completed work: $summary"
   ```

3. **Error Note**: Added with error logging
