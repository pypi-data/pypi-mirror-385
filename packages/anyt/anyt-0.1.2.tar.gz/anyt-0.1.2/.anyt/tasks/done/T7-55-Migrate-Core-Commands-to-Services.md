# T7-55: Migrate Core Commands to Services

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Completed
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Completed**: 2025-10-21
**Parent**: T7-48 (CLI Architecture Improvements)

## Description

Refactor workspace, project, label, view, and board commands to use typed services instead of the old `APIClient`. This completes the command migration and eliminates all direct usage of old client.

## Objectives

- Migrate workspace commands to use WorkspaceService
- Migrate project commands to use ProjectService (create if needed)
- Migrate label commands to use LabelService (create if needed)
- Migrate view commands to use ViewService (create if needed)
- Migrate board/visualization commands to use services
- Update all type hints to use models

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create additional services as needed:
  - [ ] `services/project_service.py` - ProjectService
  - [ ] `services/label_service.py` - LabelService
  - [ ] `services/view_service.py` - ViewService
- [ ] Refactor `commands/workspace.py`:
  - [ ] Use WorkspaceService for all operations
  - [ ] Use Workspace model instead of dict
- [ ] Refactor `commands/project.py`:
  - [ ] Use ProjectService for all operations
  - [ ] Use Project model instead of dict
- [ ] Refactor `commands/label.py`:
  - [ ] Use LabelService for all operations
  - [ ] Use Label model instead of dict
- [ ] Refactor `commands/view.py`:
  - [ ] Use ViewService for all operations
  - [ ] Use TaskView model instead of dict
- [ ] Refactor `commands/board.py`:
  - [ ] Use TaskService for data fetching
  - [ ] Use Task model for rendering
- [ ] Refactor `commands/preference.py`:
  - [ ] Use PreferencesService (create if needed)
- [ ] No commands import old APIClient
- [ ] Type checking passes: `make typecheck`
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass

## Technical Notes

### Service Creation

Create simple services following the BaseService pattern:

```python
# services/project_service.py
class ProjectService(BaseService):
    def _init_clients(self):
        self.projects = ProjectsAPIClient.from_config(self.config)

    async def get_or_create_default_project(
        self,
        workspace_id: int
    ) -> Project:
        """Get or create default project."""
        try:
            return await self.projects.get_current_project(workspace_id)
        except NotFoundError:
            # Create default
            return await self.projects.create_project(...)
```

### Command Migration

Follow same pattern as T7-54 task commands:
1. Replace APIClient with Service
2. Use typed models
3. Update error handling
4. Validate output unchanged

### Testing

- All existing tests must pass
- Command behavior unchanged
- Output format unchanged
- Exit codes unchanged
