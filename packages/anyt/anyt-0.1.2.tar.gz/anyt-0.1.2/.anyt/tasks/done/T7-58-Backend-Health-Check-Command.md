# T7-58: Backend Health Check Command

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Completed
**Created**: 2025-10-20

## Description

Add a CLI command to check if the AnyTask backend API server is healthy and reachable. The command should call the `/health` endpoint on the configured API server and provide clear feedback on the server's status.

## Objectives

- Implement `anyt health` command to check backend server health
- Call the `/health` endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/health`)
- Parse and display health check response
- Provide clear error messages when health check fails
- Support all configured environments (dev/staging/prod)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `health.py` command module in `src/cli/commands/`
- [x] Implement `anyt health` command that:
  - [x] Uses current environment configuration
  - [x] Calls `GET /health` endpoint
  - [x] Displays success status with timestamp when healthy
  - [x] Shows clear error message with details when unhealthy or unreachable
  - [x] Returns appropriate exit codes (0 for healthy, 1 for unhealthy/error)
- [x] Expected healthy response format:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20T19:41:25.992622"
  }
  ```
- [x] Error handling for:
  - [x] Network connectivity issues (connection refused, timeout)
  - [x] Invalid/unexpected response format
  - [x] HTTP error responses (4xx, 5xx)
  - [x] No environment configured
- [x] Rich console output with:
  - [x] Green success message for healthy status
  - [x] Red error message for unhealthy/unreachable
  - [x] Display API URL being checked
  - [x] Display timestamp from response
- [x] Add unit tests for health command
- [x] Tests written and passing (10 unit tests, all passing)
- [x] Code reviewed and merged (linting, formatting, type checking all passed)

## Dependencies

None - this is a standalone diagnostic command

## Estimated Effort

2-3 hours

## Technical Notes

### Implementation Approach

1. **Command Module** (`src/cli/commands/health.py`):
   - Create Typer command with no required arguments
   - Use `Config.load()` to get current environment
   - Make HTTP GET request to `{api_url}/health`
   - Parse JSON response and validate format

2. **HTTP Client**:
   - Use `httpx.AsyncClient` for async request
   - Set reasonable timeout (5 seconds)
   - Handle connection errors gracefully

3. **Output Format**:
   ```
   # Success case
   ✓ Backend server is healthy
   API URL: http://localhost:8000
   Status: healthy
   Timestamp: 2025-10-20T19:41:25.992622

   # Error case - connection refused
   ✗ Backend server is unreachable
   API URL: http://localhost:8000
   Error: Connection refused. Is the server running?

   # Error case - invalid response
   ✗ Backend server returned invalid response
   API URL: http://localhost:8000
   Error: Expected 'status' field in response
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   - `httpx.ConnectError` → "Connection refused. Is the server running?"
   - `httpx.TimeoutError` → "Request timed out. Server may be overloaded."
   - `httpx.HTTPStatusError` → "Server returned error: {status_code}"
   - Missing `status` field → "Invalid response format"
   - No environment configured → "No environment configured. Run 'anyt env add' first."

5. **Testing**:
   - Mock httpx client in unit tests
   - Test success case with valid response
   - Test connection errors
   - Test invalid response formats
   - Test missing environment configuration

### Code Structure

```python
# src/cli/commands/health.py
import typer
from rich.console import Console
import httpx
from cli.config import Config

app = typer.Typer()
console = Console()

@app.command()
def check():
    """Check if the AnyTask backend server is healthy."""
    # Implementation here
```

### Integration Points

- Register in `src/cli/main.py`:
  ```python
  from cli.commands import health
  app.add_typer(health.app, name="health")
  ```

## Events

### 2025-10-20 19:45 - Created
- Task created based on user request for backend health check functionality
- Next task ID: T7-58
- Placed in backlog for future implementation

### 2025-10-20 19:48 - Started work
- Task moved from backlog to active
- Beginning implementation of health check command
- Will create command module, implement health check logic, and add tests

### 2025-10-20 19:52 - Implementation completed
- Created `src/cli/commands/health.py` with complete health check implementation
- Registered health command in `src/cli/main.py` (replaced old async implementation)
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/cli/unit/test_health_command.py` (10 tests)
- All tests passing successfully
- Fixed linting issues (removed unused f-strings and imports)
- Code quality checks passed: format ✓, lint ✓, typecheck ✓
- Manual testing confirmed functionality with live server
- Command working correctly with both `anyt health` and `anyt health check`
- Error handling verified for all scenarios (connection errors, timeouts, invalid responses)
