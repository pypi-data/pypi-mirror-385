# T4-4: Goal Decomposer Enhancements

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Completed

## Description
Complete the remaining features for the AI Task Decomposer from T4-1. This task addresses the TODO items that were deferred for future iteration: automatic dependency creation, goal-task linking, event logging, and enhanced error handling.

## Objectives
- Automatically create task dependencies from decomposer output
- Link tasks to parent goal in database schema
- Log decomposition events with token cost tracking
- Add robust error handling for Claude API failures with exponential backoff retry

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies Automatically Created from Decomposer Output

**Current State**: Decomposer returns dependencies but doesn't create them in database.

**What to Build**:
- Update decompose endpoint to create TaskDependency records
- Use TaskDependencyRepository after task creation
- Map dependency indices to actual task IDs
- Location: `src/backend/routes/v1/goals.py:350-357` (currently commented TODO)

**Code to Implement**:
```python
# In decompose_goal endpoint, after creating tasks
for dep in dependencies:
    from_idx = dep["from_index"]
    to_idx = dep["to_index"]
    from_task_id = task_id_map[from_idx]
    to_task_id = task_id_map[to_idx]

    # Create dependency via task dependencies repository
    await repos.task_dependencies.create(
        workspace_id=goal.workspace_id,
        task_id=from_task_id,
        depends_on_task_id=to_task_id,
    )
```

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Decomposer creates TaskDependency records for all returned dependencies
- [ ] Dependency graph is validated before creation (no cycles)
- [ ] Integration test verifies dependencies are created correctly

### 2. Tasks Linked to Parent Goal

**Current State**: Tasks created by decomposer have no reference to originating goal.

**What to Build**:
- Add `goal_id` column to tasks table (nullable, foreign key to goals)
- Update Task domain model with optional goal_id field
- Update TaskRepository.create to accept goal_id parameter
- Set goal_id when creating tasks from decomposition

**Database Migration**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN goal_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tasks_goal_id
  FOREIGN KEY (goal_id) REFERENCES goals(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_goal_id ON tasks(goal_id);
```

**Code Changes**:
- `src/backend/db_schema/models.py`: Add goal_id column to Task model
- `src/backend/domain/models.py`: Add goal_id to TaskBase
- `src/backend/routes/v1/goals.py`: Pass goal_id when creating tasks

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Tasks table has goal_id column
- [ ] TaskCreate accepts optional goal_id
- [ ] Tasks created via decompose have goal_id set
- [ ] Can query tasks by goal_id
- [ ] Integration test verifies goal-task relationship

### 3. Decomposition Event Logged with Token Cost

**Current State**: No audit trail of decomposition operations.

**What to Build**:
- Create Event record after each decomposition
- Include metadata: token cost, cache hit, number of tasks created
- Event type: "goal.decomposed"
- Use EventRepository to log events

**Code to Implement**:
```python
# After successful decomposition
from backend.domain.models import EventCreate

event = EventCreate(
    workspace_id=goal.workspace_id,
    actor_id=user.user_id,
    actor_type="user",
    entity_type="goal",
    entity_id=str(goal_id),
    event_type="goal.decomposed",
    changes={
        "tasks_created": len(tasks),
        "dependencies_created": len(dependencies),
    },
    extra_metadata={
        "cost_tokens": metadata.get("cost_tokens"),
        "cache_hit": metadata.get("cache_hit"),
        "cache_creation_tokens": metadata.get("cache_creation_tokens"),
        "cache_read_tokens": metadata.get("cache_read_tokens"),
        "dry_run": request.dry_run,
    },
)
await repos.events.create(event)
```

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Event created for each decomposition (dry_run and actual)
- [ ] Event includes token cost metadata
- [ ] Event includes cache hit information
- [ ] Can query decomposition history via events
- [ ] Integration test verifies event creation

### 4. Error Handling for Claude API Failures with Retry

**Current State**: Basic exception handling, no retry logic.

**What to Build**:
- Implement exponential backoff retry for transient failures
- Handle specific Claude API errors (rate limits, timeouts, etc.)
- Add circuit breaker pattern for sustained failures
- Log retry attempts and failures

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
import asyncio
from tenacity import (
    retry,
    stop_after_attempt,
    wait_exponential,
    retry_if_exception_type,
)
from anthropic import RateLimitError, APITimeoutError

class DecomposerService:
    @retry(
        stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
        wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=10),
        retry=retry_if_exception_type((RateLimitError, APITimeoutError)),
        reraise=True,
    )
    async def decompose(self, goal: Goal, ...) -> ...:
        # Existing decompose logic
        # Retry automatically on RateLimitError or APITimeoutError
```

**Error Classifications**:
- **Retryable**: Rate limits, timeouts, temporary API errors
- **Non-retryable**: Invalid API key, malformed requests, validation errors
- **Circuit breaker**: After 3 consecutive failures, wait 60 seconds

**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- [ ] Distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors
- [ ] Logs retry attempts with context
- [ ] Returns helpful error messages to user
- [ ] Integration test verifies retry behavior (mock API failures)

## API Endpoints

No new endpoints. Enhancements to existing `/v1/goals/{goal_id}/decompose`.

## Dependencies
- T4-1: AI Task Decomposer Agent (completed)
- Requires: EventRepository for event logging

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours

## Technical Notes
- Use existing TaskDependencyRepository for dependency creation
- Use Alembic for goal_id column migration
- Use `tenacity` library for retry logic with exponential backoff
- Ensure all changes maintain backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive tests for each enhancement

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dependencies automatically created from decomposer output
- [ ] Tasks have goal_id foreign key linking to parent goal
- [ ] Decomposition events logged with full metadata
- [ ] Error handling includes retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] All new code passes linting, type checking, and tests
- [ ] Migration applied successfully
- [ ] Integration tests cover all enhancements
- [ ] Documentation updated (API docs, CLAUDE.md if needed)

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Retry logic, error classification
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify dependencies created after decomposition
   - Verify goal_id set on created tasks
   - Verify event logging
   - Mock API failures to test retry behavior
3. **Manual Testing**: Full decomposition flow with real Claude API

## Future Considerations
- Track decomposition costs per workspace for billing
- Add webhook notifications for decomposition completion
- Support for updating existing task breakdowns
- A/B testing different decomposition prompts
