## Critical Path

The critical path (longest dependency chain) is:

1. T1-1 â†’ T1-2 â†’ T1-3 â†’ T2-1 â†’ T2-1.7 â†’ T2-5 â†’ T2-6 â†’ T2-7 â†’ T2-8 â†’ T2-9 â†’ T2-2 â†’ T2-3 â†’ T2-4 â†’ T3-1 â†’ T3-2 â†’ T3-4 â†’ T4-3 â†’ T5-1 â†’ T5-3 â†’ T6-2

**Critical Path Duration**: ~117-153 hours

**Note**: CLI development (T3-x) now comes before AI integration (T4-x) to enable direct backend access and testing first. Repository migration (T2-5 through T2-9) is complete âœ….

## Parallelization Opportunities

### Repository Migration Phase (T2-5 to T2-9) - COMPLETED âœ…
**Sequential**: These were done in order to validate the pattern incrementally:
1. T2-5 (Foundation) âœ… - Set up infrastructure
2. T2-6 (Projects) âœ… - Proof of concept
3. T2-7 (Tasks) âœ… - Complex entity validation
4. T2-8 (Workspaces) âœ… - Complete core entities
5. T2-9 (Remaining) âœ… - Finish migration

### Can Work in Parallel (After Repository Migration)
- T2-2 (Dependencies) + T2-3 (Attempts) + T2-4 (Events)
- T3-2 (CLI Tasks) + T3-3 (CLI Board) (both depend on T3-1)
- T4-1 (AI Decomposer) + T4-2 (AI Organizer) (after T3-4)
- T5-2 (Web Board) + T5-3 (Web Detail)
- T6-1 (Realtime) + T6-2 (Analytics) + T6-3 (Integrations)

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-15: Task Restructuring - CLI Before AI
- **Phase reordering**: CLI development (T3) now comes before AI integration (T4)
- Rationale: CLI enables direct backend testing and user workflows first
- CLI enhanced with multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- CLI supports remote server configuration and user directory settings
- Repository pattern migration (T2-5 through T2-9) completed âœ…
- Repository pattern provides type-safe data access layer
- Next priority: T2-2 (Task Dependencies) to enable more complex workflows
