# T4-2-1: Organizer Repositories & Database Migration

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Completed

## Description
Create repositories for Summary and OrganizationSuggestion entities, and apply database migration for the new tables. This task implements the data access layer for the AI Organizer features.

## Objectives
- Create SummaryRepository with CRUD operations
- Create OrganizationSuggestionRepository with filtering
- Add repositories to RepositoryFactory
- Generate and apply database migration
- Verify migration creates tables correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] SummaryRepository created in repositories/summary.py
  - [x] get_by_id, create, list_by_workspace, list_by_period methods
  - [x] Proper domain model conversion
- [x] OrganizationSuggestionRepository created in repositories/organization_suggestion.py
  - [x] get_by_id, create, update, list_by_workspace methods
  - [x] Filter by status, suggestion_type, task_id
- [x] Both repositories added to RepositoryFactory
- [x] Database migration created with `make db-revision`
- [x] Migration applied with `make db-migrate`
- [x] Tables created: summaries, organization_suggestions
- [x] All indexes and constraints created correctly

## Dependencies
- T4-2: AI Organizer (Core Infrastructure)

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Technical Notes
- Follow pattern from GoalRepository and TaskRepository
- Use BaseRepository as parent class
- Include proper type hints and docstrings
- Test migration with rollback to ensure reversibility
- Verify foreign key constraints work correctly
