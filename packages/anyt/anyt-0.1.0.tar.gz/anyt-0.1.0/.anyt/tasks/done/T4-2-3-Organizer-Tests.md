# T4-2-3: Organizer Tests

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Completed

## Description
Write comprehensive tests for organizer repositories, services, and API endpoints. Ensure all functionality works correctly and edge cases are handled.

## Objectives
- Write repository unit tests
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Test AI service functions
- Verify error handling
- Achieve high code coverage

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Repository tests in tests/repositories/
  - [ ] test_summary.py (5+ tests)
  - [ ] test_organization_suggestion.py (5+ tests)
  - [ ] CRUD operations tested
  - [ ] Filtering and querying tested
- [ ] Integration tests in tests/
  - [ ] test_organizer.py (15+ tests)
  - [ ] Organize endpoint (dry-run and apply modes)
  - [ ] Summary generation and retrieval
  - [ ] Auto-fill task details
  - [ ] Duplicate detection
  - [ ] Error cases (404, auth failures)
- [ ] Service tests (optional, for complex logic)
  - [ ] Mock Claude API responses
  - [ ] Test JSON extraction
  - [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] All tests pass: `make test`
- [ ] Code quality checks pass:
  - [ ] `make lint` passes
  - [ ] `make format` passes
  - [ ] `make typecheck` passes

## Dependencies
- T4-2-2: Organizer API Endpoints

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours

## Technical Notes
- Use seed_basic_data() from tests/seeds.py for test data
- Mock OrganizerService for API tests to avoid AI calls
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify events are logged correctly
- Check that dry_run mode doesn't modify data
- Test pagination and filtering
