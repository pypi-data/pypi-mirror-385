## 🚀 How to Distribute (Proprietary Software)

### ✅ Recommended: Share Wheel Files

**You CAN distribute the compiled wheel file:**

```bash
# The wheel file to share:
dist/anyt-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Share via:
- Internal file server
- Slack/Teams (internal channels)
- Email to clients/partners
- AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage (private bucket)
- Private GitHub releases
```

**Users install with:**
```bash
pip install anyt-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
# or
pipx install anyt-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### ✅ For Scale: Private Package Repository

Set up internal PyPI server:

**AWS CodeArtifact:**
```bash
# One-time setup
aws codeartifact create-repository \
  --domain anytransformer \
  --repository anyt-cli

# Publish
twine upload --repository-url <codeartifact-url> dist/*

# Users install
pip install anyt --index-url https://<codeartifact-url>/simple/
```

**Azure Artifacts / Google Artifact Registry / JFrog Artifactory** - See `DISTRIBUTION_GUIDE_INTERNAL.md`

### ❌ DO NOT Do These

- ❌ Publish to public PyPI (pypi.org)
- ❌ Make GitHub repository public
- ❌ Share source code with unauthorized parties
- ❌ Publish to open source package managers
