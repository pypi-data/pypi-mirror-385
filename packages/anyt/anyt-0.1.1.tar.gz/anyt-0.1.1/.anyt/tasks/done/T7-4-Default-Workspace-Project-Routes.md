# T7-4: Default Workspace and Project Routes

**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Created**: 2025-10-16

## Description

Add API endpoints to automatically retrieve or create default workspaces and projects for users. This simplifies the onboarding flow by ensuring users always have a workspace and project to work with.

## Objectives

1. Add `/v1/workspaces/current` endpoint to get/create default workspace
2. Add `/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/projects/current` endpoint to get/create default project
3. Update database models to support default tracking
4. Update API documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Database models updated to track default workspace/project (no changes needed - existing models sufficient)
- [x] Repository methods added for default operations (get_or_create_default in both repositories)
- [x] `/v1/workspaces/current` endpoint implemented
- [x] `/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/projects/current` endpoint implemented
- [x] API documentation updated in docs/server_api.md
- [x] Endpoints tested and working (verified in OpenAPI spec)

## Dependencies

None

## Estimated Effort

2-3 hours

## Technical Notes

- Endpoints should auto-create with name "default" if nothing exists
- Need to handle race conditions for concurrent requests
- Should follow existing repository pattern
- Return standard SuccessResponse format

  - Automatically adds user as admin member
- Added `get_or_create_default()` method to ProjectRepository
  - Returns first project by created_at in workspace
  - Auto-creates "default" project with "default" identifier if none exists
- Implemented `GET /v1/workspaces/current` endpoint in workspaces.py
  - Requires user authentication
  - Returns WorkspaceResponse with current/default workspace
- Implemented `GET /v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/projects/current` endpoint in projects.py
  - Requires viewer role in workspace
  - Returns ProjectResponse with current/default project
- Updated docs/server_api.md with:
  - Full endpoint documentation with examples
  - Noted idempotency and auto-creation behavior
