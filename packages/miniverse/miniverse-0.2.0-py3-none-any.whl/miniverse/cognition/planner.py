      and recent memories (Stanford Generative Agents pattern)
    - **Custom deterministic**: Hardcoded plans based on agent role or conditions
      (see examples/workshop/run.py DeterministicPlanner)
    - **None**: Skip planning phase entirely (agent is purely reactive via executor)

    When to use:
    - LLM agents that benefit from long-term coherence and goal pursuit
    - Deterministic agents with complex multi-step behaviors
    - Skip for simple reactive agents (deterministic or LLM)
