"""
SimulationRules interface for defining deterministic physics in Miniverse simulations.

This module provides the abstract base class for implementing world physics rules.
Users subclass SimulationRules to define how their world evolves each tick
through deterministic Python code (not LLM interpretation).

Key responsibilities:
- Apply one tick of deterministic physics (resource consumption, degradation, etc.)
- Validate whether agent actions are physically possible
- Generate probabilistic events (weather, equipment failures, etc.)

Design principle: If it can be calculated, calculate it (don't ask LLM).

    Converts resource Stat objects into concise display format for console/logs.
    Default formatter used by SimulationRules.format_resource_summary() unless

    Formatting rules:
    - Uses stat.label if available, otherwise prettifies key name
    - Floats >= 10 show 1 decimal place (e.g., "23.5")
    - Floats < 10 show 2 decimal places (e.g., "3.14")

class SimulationRules(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for defining deterministic physics in a simulation world.

    SimulationRules implements the core Miniverse principle: "If it can be calculated,
    calculate it (don't ask the LLM)." This interface separates controllable physics
    (Python code) from emergent behavior (LLM agent decisions).

    Core responsibilities:
    1. apply_tick() - Passive world evolution (resource consumption, degradation)
    2. validate_action() - Physical constraints enforcement (capacity, skills)
    3. Lifecycle hooks - on_simulation_start(), on_simulation_end()

    Environment tier relationship:
    - Tier 0 (KPI-only): Simple rules, no spatial logic
    - Tier 1 (Logical): Room capacity, adjacency constraints
    - Tier 2 (Spatial): Collision detection, pathfinding, line-of-sight

    What BELONGS in SimulationRules (deterministic physics):
    - Resource consumption rates (oxygen, power, food)
    - Equipment degradation over time (health *= 0.999 per tick)
    - Physical constraints (room capacity, distance limits)
    - Probabilistic events with seeds (dust storms, equipment failures)
    - Time progression effects (day/night cycles, seasonal changes)

    What does NOT belong in SimulationRules (LLM territory):
    - Agent decision-making ("what should I do?")
    - Communication content ("what should I say?")
    - Creative responses ("how do I feel about this?")
    - Social dynamics (handled through agent memory and perception)

    Design pattern: SimulationRules subclasses are dependency-injected into Orchestrator.
    This enables swapping physics implementations without changing agent code (Mars base
    vs factory simulation vs office environment - same agent framework, different rules).

    Example implementation: See miniverse/implementations/mars_rules.py
