class SimulationRun(BaseModel):
    """Metadata tracking for a single simulation run (persistence record).

    SimulationRun stores high-level metadata about a simulation execution for historical
    tracking and analysis. Used by all persistence backends (InMemory, JSON, Postgres).

    Purpose:
    - Track multiple simulation runs (experiments, parameter sweeps, debugging)
    - Store configuration for reproducibility
    - Monitor run status (running/completed/failed)
    - Enable querying ("show me all runs from last week")

    Lifecycle:
    1. Created before simulation starts (status="running")
    2. Updated each tick by persistence backend
    3. Finalized when simulation completes (status="completed", end_time set)
    4. Queried for analysis/replay

    Design rationale:
    - UUID id enables distributed simulation (no collision risk)
    - config dict stores LLM settings, scenario name, physics rules for reproducibility
    - Wall-clock times (start_time, end_time) track real execution duration
    - num_ticks/num_agents enable filtering runs by scale

class AgentMemory(BaseModel):
    """A single memory in an agent's memory stream (Stanford Generative Agents pattern).

    AgentMemory implements the memory stream pattern from Stanford research: agents accumulate
    natural language observations over time, which inform future decisions. Each memory is a
    timestamped, importance-weighted record that can be retrieved and reflected upon.

    Stanford pattern: "The memory stream is a database of an agent's experiences, stored as
    natural language. Memories have importance scores that decay over time, and agents retrieve
    relevant memories when making decisions."

    Memory types:
    - observation: Perceived events ("Oxygen levels dropped to 15%")
    - action: Agent's own actions ("I repaired the water recycler")
    - communication: Messages received ("Alice asked me to check the greenhouse")
    - reflection: Higher-order summaries ("Team morale declining due to isolation")

    Importance scoring (1-10):
    - 1-3: Mundane observations (routine status checks)
    - 4-6: Notable events (equipment repairs, conversations)
    - 7-9: Significant events (emergencies, conflicts, breakthroughs)
    - 10: Life-changing events (disasters, major discoveries)

    Future extensions:
    - embedding_key: Reference to vector store for semantic retrieval
    - branch_id: Support for timeline branching (loom pattern)
    - tags: Enable filtering by topic/entity for focused retrieval

class SimulationError(BaseModel):
    """Error tracking record for debugging simulation failures.

    SimulationError captures exceptions and failures during simulation execution for
    post-mortem analysis. Stored by persistence backends to enable debugging without
    losing error context.

    Use cases:
    - LLM errors (rate limits, invalid JSON, timeout)
    - Validation errors (agent proposes impossible action)
    - Physics errors (deterministic rules raise exception)
    - Persistence errors (database connection lost)

    Error handling strategy:
    1. Orchestrator catches exception during tick processing
    2. Creates SimulationError record with context
    3. Persists error for later analysis
    4. Optionally continues simulation (for transient errors) or halts (for fatal errors)
    5. User queries errors to diagnose failures

    Design rationale:
    - tick field enables pinpointing when failure occurred (replay up to tick N-1)
    - error_type enables grouping similar failures (e.g., "all rate limit errors")
    - stack_trace preserves full context for debugging
    - Separate from logging - these are stored permanently for analysis
