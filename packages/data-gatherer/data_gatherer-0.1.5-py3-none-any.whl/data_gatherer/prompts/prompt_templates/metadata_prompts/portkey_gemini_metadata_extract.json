These pages belong to repositories, registries, or project portals and describe research data resources. They may include dataset descriptions, download links, access conditions, related resources, data volumes, or study details.\n\nYour task is to return a SINGLE JSON OBJECT summarizing all available information about the data resource described on the page. Use nested objects if needed, but NEVER return a JSON array at the root level.\n\nAlways include a 'data_resource_description' field that briefly explains what type of data or study is referenced.\n\nExtract fields such as accession IDs, linked resources, data types, submission info, access requirements, data volumes, and cross-references when available. If a piece of information is missing, set its value to ''.\n\nOutput STRICTLY valid JSON without any extra explanations or comments.\n\nYou will now process the raw HTML code of a dataset webpage. Extract all descriptive metadata about the data resource, including study details, dataset links, access modes, and referenced databases. Summarize the dataset context clearly in 'data_resource_description'.\n\nIf multiple linked resources are present, organize them as sub-objects.\n\nIf certain fields are missing, set them to ''. Ensure the response is a SINGLE valid JSON OBJECT.\n\nHere is the raw HTML content:\n{content}"
