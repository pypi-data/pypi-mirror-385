## Installation

Suzuki-Trotter-Evolver can be installed as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Christopher-K-Long/Suzuki-Trotter-Evolver
cd Suzuki-Trotter-Evolver
cmake -S . -B build # set optional flags here
sudo cmake --build build --config Release --target install -j $(nproc)
```

There are several optional flags that can be set:
- ``-DSuzuki-Trotter-Evolver_INSTALL_LIBRARY=ON/OFF``(Suzuki-Trotter-Evolver is installed if set to ``ON``)
- ``-DSuzuki-Trotter-Evolver_BUILD_TESTING=ON/OFF`` (The unit tests and examples are build and run if set to ``ON``)
- ``-DSuzuki-Trotter-Evolver_BUILD_DOCS=ON/OFF`` (The documentation is build if set to ``ON``)

These optional flags should be appended to ``cmake -S ../.. -B build``. All three default to ``ON`` if the project is top level (i.e. if the project is not being build as a dependency of another project).
