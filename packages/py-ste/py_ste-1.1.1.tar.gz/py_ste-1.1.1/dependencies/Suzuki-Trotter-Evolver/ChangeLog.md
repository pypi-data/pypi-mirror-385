# [Suzuki-Trotter-Evolver](README.md) Change Log

## Release 1.1.0

- Added `UnitaryEvolver::get_evolution()` to generate the unitary describing the systems evolution.
- Added `unitary_gate_infidelity()` to calculate gate infidelities.
- Added `UnitaryEvolver::evolved_gate_infidelity()` to calculate the gate infidelity of a unitary generated by a system Hamiltonian.
- Added `UnitaryEvolver::gate_switching_function()` to calculate the switching function with respect to the gate infidelity.
- Added `UnitaryEvolver::evolved_inner_product()` to calculate the inner product of an evolved state vector with some fixed vector.
- Added `UnitaryEvolver::evolved_inner_product_all()` to calculate the inner products of a state vector at each timestep during its evolution with some fixed vector.
- Updated the arXiv reference to:
