# the constraint on types-requests is for python 3.7(+?), otherwise the pip
# install process takes ages (because there are gazillions of versions of
# boto/botocore and it takes ages for pip to find a compatible one).
# See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/stubs/requests/METADATA.toml
# It's not needed in the main requirement, but keeping it in -tests.txt would
# break dependencies of swh.export (not depending on swh.export[testing]).
