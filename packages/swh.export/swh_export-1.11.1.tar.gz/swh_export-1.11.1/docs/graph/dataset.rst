Dataset
=======

We aim to provide regular exports of the Software Heritage graph in two
different formats:

- **Columnar data storage**: a set of relational tables stored in a columnar
  format such as `Apache ORC <https://orc.apache.org/>`_, which is particularly
  suited for scale-out analyses on data lakes and big data processing
  ecosystems such as the Hadoop environment.

- **Compressed graph**: a compact and highly-efficient representation of the
  graph dataset, suited for scale-up analysis on high-end machines with large
  amounts of memory. The graph is compressed in *Boldi-Vigna representation*,
  designed to be loaded by the `WebGraph framework
  <https://webgraph.di.unimi.it/>`_, specifically using our `swh-graph
  library <https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-graph/index.html>`_.

See also :ref:`using-swh-data`.

   :name: remember-the-tos
   :class: important

   Usage of the datasets from the Software Heritage archive is covered by
   our `Ethical Charter`_ and the `Terms of use for bulk access`_.

Downloading the datasets
------------------------

All datasets below are available publicly and with no login required, subject
to the terms of use above.
After installing `awscli`_, datasets hosted on Amazon S3 can be downloaded
with this command::

    aws s3 cp s3://softwareheritage/graph/... ./target/path/ --recursive --no-sign-request

The latest **compressed graphs** contain some ``.zst`` files, which must be
decompressed with ``unzstd`` before they can be used with swh-graph.
