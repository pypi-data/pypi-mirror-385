Anatomic Location Search Tool

Uses two specialized Pydantic AI agents to find relevant anatomic locations for imaging findings
by searching across multiple ontology terminology databases in LanceDB.

Agent 1: Search Strategy - Generates search queries and gathers comprehensive results
Agent 2: Matching - Analyzes results and selects best primary/alternate locations
