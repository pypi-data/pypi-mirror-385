    Loads image data from a CSV file holding their sensitive and predictive attribute
    data, as well as paths relative to a root directory. Loaded images are subjected to a Python transformation.

    Args:
        path: The path to the CSV file containing information about the dataset.
        image_root_dir: The root directory where the actual image files are stored.
        target: Indicates the predictive attribute in the dataset.
        batch_size: The batch size at which images should be loaded.
        shuffle: Whether to shuffle the loaded images.
        data_transform_path: A path or implementation of a torchvision data transform. Alternatively, paste the transformation code here.
        transform_variable: The transformation target variable that should be extracted after the namesake code runs.
        num_workers: Number of subprocesses to use for data loading.
        safe_libraries: A comma-separated list of safe libraries that are allowed in the transformation code. As a safety measure against code injection attacks, an error will be created if libraries other than those are encountered.
