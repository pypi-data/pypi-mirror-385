            <h3>❓ What is this?</h3>
            <p>This module uses a large language model (LLM) as a fairness auditor of a free text snippet. 
            The model is prompted to cast multiple votes on whether the input text is biased or neutral. 
            Each vote includes reasoning, and valid votes are aggregated to capture a common perspective.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Through this chain-of-votes methodology, the LLM provides both a verdict and a narrative explanation. 
            This helps uncover hidden patterns of bias in text and yields actionable insights for improvement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-box">
            <h3>❗ Summary</h3>
            
            <p><b>The input has been classified as {title}</b> after being subjected to {chain_of_votes} 
            independent LLM assessments. The reasoning highlights which aspects of the text contribute to this 
            judgement and  offers {'mitigation steps to address biases' if title.startswith('Biased') else 'an explanation of why the text is considered neutral'}.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>There are reasoning outputs and action points to improve fairness.
            However, these should be used as guidance rather than definitive answers or course of action. 
            Remember that LLM auditors may reflect the biases of their training or finetuning corpora. 
            Manual inspection is recommended to validate findings.</p>
