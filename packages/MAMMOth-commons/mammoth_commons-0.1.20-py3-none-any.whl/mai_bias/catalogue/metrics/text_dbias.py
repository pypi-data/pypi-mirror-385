    # RANT AHEAD WITH SOME USEFUL INFO ABOUT FUTURE CHOICES - BUT NOT EXPECTING ANYONE TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THIS
    #
    # The whole implementation is a complete and utter hack because the original release of DBias
    # has been rendered basically obsolete by the uselessly fast-evolving LLM technology landscape.
    #
    # I don't care if you present the latest SOTA framework if this is going to break in a couple of months
    # forever. To be clear: I am mainly bashing transformers and the huggingface ecosystem's hype
    # and not dbias (who is at most guilty of a couple questionable engineering choices - like we all are).
    #
    # If you follow instructions from the dbias repo prepare for a world of pain. In fact, I have suggested
    # the solution in this file to that repository as a more helpful (!) alternative to installing stuff.
    # And I still needed to create a fork of the repo, remove dependency freezes,
    # and orchestrate a git installation.
    #
    # So the hacks:
    #
    # - MAI-BIAS installs the default version of numpy (which is later than 2.0).
    #   I do not know why people keep freezing versions of numpy without good reason. *Everyone* uses numpy
    #   in AI and this is the easiest way to create a mess.
    # - We also install the latest version of spacy, because older ones often do not compile (I am failing
    #   to compile the required one in kubuntu with Python 3.13 and refuse to investigate a library that should be
    #   working out of the box but failing because everyone is too hyped by new technologies to create maintainable
    #   software)
    # - Thankfully, more recent versions (currently 3.2.0 which I will not freeze because it is more likely that it
    #   will not be maintained than a new release is to break backwards compatibility) still properly load the packaged
    #   models, despite throwing a ton of warnings.
    # - Lastly we manually unpack `en_pipeline-any-py3-none-any.whl` into site-packages WITHOUT INSTALLING ITS
    #   DECLARED DEPENDENCIES. Python's build system works well when the latest version=best import. The ease of docker
    #   has promoted frozen package versions and in response more tooling that makes absolutely zero sense when
    #   you try to do something constructive by actually combining solutions instead of deploying apps or microservices.
    # - Also disabled GPU to prevent JIT-ing because this is the one thing that breaks after all the other sorcery.
    #   Surprised we reached so far, honestly.
    # - There's a chance pip's eager upgrade will work. But this also works and does what I want it to for sure.
    # - Yes, I could also add a large try-catch to guarantee restoration of `os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]`
    #   but this is hacky enough and runs fast enough for me to prefer the occasional user issue rather than
    #   looking at the monstrosity of having another nesting block. I HOPE I'm not breaking other cuda devices
    #   in other modules in the demonstrator due to module caching, but if I do let's make future versions
    #   unload the cached GPU framework's import that dbias uses.
    #
    # Good luck to all out there. - Manios
