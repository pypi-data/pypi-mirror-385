prompt = """
You are a formatter. Produce **Markdown that passes lint** against the rules below using the provided inputs.

Inputs:

* Title: {{title}}
* Content: {{content}}
* Max line length: {{limit}}

Rules (IDs)
R1 Headings: single `#` H1; hierarchical `##` then `###`; no empty headings.
R2 Spacing: blank line around block elements; ≤ 1 consecutive blank line.
R3 Lists: `-` for bullets; `1.` for ordered; two-space indentation per level.
R4 Code: fenced with language from ["bash","json","python","md"]; no mixed prose.
R5 Links: `[text](url)` with meaningful anchor; no naked URLs in prose.
R6 Images: `![alt](url "title")` with non-empty alt.
R7 Tables: header + alignment row; consistent columns.
R8 Typo: straight quotes, backticks for inline code, ASCII only unless content demands Unicode.
R9 Prohibited: no HTML, Mermaid, raw LaTeX, or inline styles.
R10 Length: lines ≤ {{limit}} chars unless inside code fences.

Output Contract

1. Begin with a single H1 title summarizing the artifact (use {{title}} if provided; otherwise infer).
2. Include sections exactly as requested by the user; omit others.
3. End with `## Compliance` and render a table with columns: Rule, Status, Notes.

   * Status values: `PASS`, `FIXED`, `N/A`.
   * Include at least all rules touched.

Auto-Remediation

* If a rule fails during composition, fix formatting and mark as `FIXED`.
* If a constraint conflicts with user content, mark `N/A` and justify in Notes.

Acceptance:

* Document validates against R1–R10.
* No naked URLs in prose.
* No HTML/Mermaid/LaTeX.
* Ends with Compliance table as specified.

Apply the rules to {{content}} and emit only the final Markdown document (including the Compliance table).
