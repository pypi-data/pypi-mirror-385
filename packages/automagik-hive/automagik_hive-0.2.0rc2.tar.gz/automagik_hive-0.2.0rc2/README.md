## 🚀 What is Automagik Hive?

**Automagik Hive** is a production-ready multi-agent orchestration platform that transforms weeks of infrastructure setup into a single command. Built on [Agno's](https://agno.com) blazing-fast core (3μs agent instantiation), Hive is the difference between building a house from scratch and moving into one that's already furnished.

### 🏭 The Problem We Solve

**The Reality of AI Development:**
```
Week 1: Setup PostgreSQL + pgvector
Week 2: Configure authentication
Week 3: Build RAG system
Week 4: Implement agent coordination
Week 5: Add hot reload
Week 6: Write deployment scripts
Result: Still not production-ready 😰
```

**With Automagik Hive:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namastexlabs/automagik-hive/main/install.sh | bash
automagik-hive dev

# 5 minutes later: Production-ready AI agents running ✨
```

### ✨ What Makes Hive Different

**Other Frameworks Make You Choose:**
- ❌ Simple YAML configs OR production-ready systems
- ❌ Fast prototyping OR enterprise features
- ❌ Easy setup OR powerful capabilities

**Hive Gives You Everything:**
- ✅ **YAML-First Configuration** - No complex code needed
- ✅ **Production-Ready Out of the Box** - Database, auth, monitoring included
- ✅ **True Multi-Agent Coordination** - Not just chained tool calls
- ✅ **One-Click Install** - Complete environment in minutes
- ✅ **Hot Reload** - Changes apply without restarting
- ✅ **Built on Agno** - 3μs agent instantiation, 6.5KB memory per agent

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🚀 **One-Click Production Environment**
Complete stack ready in minutes: PostgreSQL + pgvector, authentication, logging, metrics, and deployment scripts. No weeks of DevOps work.

### 📝 **YAML-First Agent Design**
```yaml
agent:
  name: "Customer Support"
  model: "gpt-4"

instructions: |
  You help customers with billing and account issues.

knowledge_filter:
  business_unit_filter: "customer_support"
```
Create sophisticated agents without touching Python. Extend with code only when needed.

### 🔄 **Hot Reload Everything**
Change configurations, update knowledge bases, modify agents - all without restarting. Deploy updates with zero downtime.

### 🧠 **Built-in RAG System**
CSV-based knowledge with pgvector, automatic vectorization, business unit filtering, and Portuguese optimization. Drop a CSV file, get intelligent retrieval.

### ⚡ **Powered by Agno's Speed**
- **3 microseconds** agent instantiation (spawn 1000s instantly)
- **6.5KB** memory per agent (entire teams on minimal infrastructure)
- **True coordination** - Shared context and memory, not tool calling

### 🤖 **Three-Layer Intelligence**
```
🧞 GENIE TEAM → Strategic coordination
    ↓
🎯 DOMAIN ORCHESTRATORS → genie-dev, genie-testing, genie-quality
    ↓
🤖 EXECUTION AGENTS → Specialized workers with 30-run memory
```

### 🔌 **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
Native integration with external services: WhatsApp, databases, APIs, and tools. Extend agents beyond their boundaries.

### 📊 **Enterprise Features Included**
- PostgreSQL with auto-schema migration
- API key authentication
- Structured logging with emoji enrichment
- Metrics and monitoring
- Docker deployment ready
- Multi-tenancy support

## 🎭 How It Works

### From YAML to Running Agent in 30 Seconds

```yaml
# ai/agents/support-agent/config.yaml
agent:
  name: "Customer Support"
  agent_id: "support-agent"
  version: "1.0.0"

model:
  provider: "anthropic"
  id: "claude-sonnet-4"

instructions: |
  You are a friendly customer support agent.
  Help users with billing questions using the knowledge base.

knowledge_filter:
  business_unit_filter: "customer_support"

storage:
  table_name: "support_sessions"
```

```bash
# Start the system
automagik-hive dev

# Your agent is live at:
# http://localhost:8886/agents/support-agent/run
```

### Extend with Python When Needed

```python
# ai/agents/support-agent/agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent

def get_support_agent(**kwargs) -> Agent:
    config = yaml.safe_load(open("config.yaml"))

    agent = Agent.from_yaml("config.yaml")

    # Add custom tools when needed
    agent.add_tool(check_billing_system)
    agent.add_tool(create_support_ticket)

    return agent
```

**The Power**: Start with YAML, extend with Python. No rewrites, no migrations, no platform lock-in.

## 📊 Built by Practitioners

We created Automagik Hive at Namastex Labs after building multi-agent systems for clients from startups to Fortune 500. We were tired of:

- 🔁 Rewriting boilerplate for every project
- 🚫 "Multi-agent" tools that were just chained agents with flaky tool calling
- ⚠️ Prototypes requiring complete rewrites for production

**In Production**: Powering hundreds of agents for real businesses
**Battle-Tested**: From startup MVPs to enterprise-scale deployments
**Continuously Improved**: We use this daily, so we keep it working

---

## 🎯 Who Uses Hive?

### 👨‍💻 **Individual Developers**
**Tired of**: Writing 1000 lines of boilerplate for simple agents
**With Hive**: YAML config → Working agent in 5 minutes
**Result**: Ship AI features 10x faster

### 🏢 **Product Teams**
**Tired of**: Waiting weeks for dev resources to prototype
**With Hive**: Configure → Test → Iterate immediately
**Result**: Validate ideas before writing code

### 🚀 **Enterprises**
**Tired of**: Prototypes that can't scale to production
**With Hive**: Same YAML from prototype to millions of requests
**Result**: Innovation at startup speed, enterprise reliability

### 🛠️ **CTOs & Tech Leads**
**Tired of**: Months of infrastructure work before value delivery
**With Hive**: Complete stack included, focus on business logic
**Result**: 95% faster time-to-production

│   └── knowledge_rag.csv     # Your knowledge data
└── .env                      # Configuration
```

### API Endpoints (Auto-Generated)

Every agent, team, and workflow automatically gets REST endpoints following Agno v2 semantics:

```bash
# Health and system
GET  /api/v1/health
GET  /api/v1/mcp/status
GET  /api/v1/mcp/servers

# Versioning (components and versions)
GET  /api/v1/version/components
POST /api/v1/version/execute

# Workflow execution
POST /v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/run

# Knowledge management
POST /v1/knowledge/upsert
GET  /v1/knowledge/search
```

Agent/team/workflow execution endpoints are auto-generated by Agno's Playground integration and may differ by configuration. See `api/CLAUDE.md` for details on the unified router and Playground mounting strategy.

## 🎨 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Customer Support Router

```yaml
# ai/teams/support-router/config.yaml
team:
  name: "Customer Support Router"
  team_id: "support-router"
  mode: "route"  # Automatic intelligent routing

members:
  - "billing-specialist"
  - "technical-support"
  - "sales-specialist"

instructions:
  - "Route billing questions to billing-specialist"
  - "Route technical issues to technical-support"
  - "Route sales inquiries to sales-specialist"
```

**Result**: 24/7 support, 70% query resolution without human intervention

### Example 2: Order Processing Workflow

```yaml
# ai/workflows/order-fulfillment/config.yaml
workflow:
  name: "Order Fulfillment"

steps:
  - name: "Validate Order"
    agent: "validator"

  - name: "Process Payment"
    parallel:
      - agent: "payment-processor"
      - agent: "fraud-checker"
      - agent: "inventory-checker"

  - name: "Ship Order"
    agent: "shipping-coordinator"

  - name: "Send Confirmation"
    agent: "notifier"
```

**Result**: 3x faster processing, automatic fraud detection

### Example 3: Knowledge-Powered Agent

```python
# ai/agents/analyst/agent.py
from lib.knowledge import get_knowledge_base

def get_analyst_agent(**kwargs):
    # Shared thread-safe knowledge base
    knowledge = get_knowledge_base(
        num_documents=5,
        csv_path="knowledge/company_data.csv"
    )

    return Agent(
        name="Data Analyst",
        knowledge=knowledge,  # Automatic RAG
        instructions="Analyze data and provide insights",
        **kwargs
    )
```

**Result**: Instant access to company knowledge, always up-to-date
