"""Custom exceptions used across the splurge-safe-io package.

This module defines a clear exception hierarchy so callers can catch
specific error categories (file, validation, parsing, streaming, etc.)
instead of dealing with generic builtins. Each exception stores a
human-readable ``message`` and optional ``details`` for diagnostic output.

Module contents are intentionally lightweight: exceptions are primarily
containers for structured error information.

Example:
    raise SplurgeSafeIoFileNotFoundError("File not found", details="/data/foo.csv")
