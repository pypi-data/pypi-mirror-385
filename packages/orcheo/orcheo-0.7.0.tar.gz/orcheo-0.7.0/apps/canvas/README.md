# Orcheo Canvas

A Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold for the visual workflow designer. The focus is on DX: hot reload, ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest for component-level tests.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run test
```

The backend can be started alongside the canvas using `uv run make dev-server` from the repository root.
