Further explanation for the transportLegs part as follows:
- There is at least one leg in each document
- There may be multiple legs between the initial and final destination

- Some documents not following an order between legs
- 'eta' must be equal or later than 'etd'!
- portOfLoading and portOfDischarge are name of the Ports. You can rely on the port names from all over the world.
- portOfLoading and portOfDischarge distinctly denotes the name of the ports. If you find abbreviation of the port use it, if not you can use the full name of the port
- Abbrevations most likely to be in the paranthesis like follows (DEHAM).
