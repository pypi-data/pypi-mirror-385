Task: You are a document entity extraction specialist. Given a document, your task is to extract the text value of the response schema provided.

Extract all the data points from the given document.
Each data point is part of a master field called "skuData". There may be multiple sku entries in a document.
Your task is to extract the text value of the following entities and their page numbers starting from 0 where the value was found in the document:

Instructions:
- Populate fields as defined in the response schema.
- Multiple SKU entries may exist—capture all instances under "skuData".
- Use the data field description to understand the context of the data.
- Many documents have data in tabular format. Pay close attention to column names to determine field relevance.
- quantityShipped and totalQuantityShipped:
    - Prioritize "Pallets/PLTS/Cartons/CTNS/Package" over "PCS" count for "quantityShipped" and "totalQuantityShipped."
    - example: If the table has "17CTNS", "9PLTS", "850", "850PCS", prioritize "9PLTS"
    - Do not extract the pack Quantity field such as "50PCS/CTN", "5PC/Box" (these represent quantity per carton, not total shipped quantity).
- packagingType and totalPackagingType:
    - "packagingType" should correspond to the unit associated with "quantityShipped" in the table.
    - "totalPackagingType" should correspond to the unit associated with "totalQuantityShipped" in the table.
    - Avoid mismatches where quantity is extracted from one column but packagingType is incorrectly labeled as other column name —instead, infer the correct unit from the value itself.
- measurement:
    - "Cubic Meter (cbm)" is preferred for "measurement"; but if not found, use dimensions(L*W*H).
    - Example: 0.34CBM, 12x4x2 CM, or etc., extract 0.34CBM
- Weight:
    - grossWeight: It can be found in the "Gross Weight, G.W, or G/W" column of the table.
    - netWeight: It can be found in the "Net Weight, N.W, or N/W" column of the table.
    - grossWeight is always greater than netWeight.
- containerNumber:
    - Container Number consists of 4 capital letters followed by 7 digits (e.g., TEMU7972458, CAIU7222892).
- If containerNumber, sealNumber, hsCode, poNumber, or poPosition are not found within an skuData entity, look for these fields elsewhere in the document. Once found, insert these fields to all relevant skuData entities by populating their respective fields.
- Do not create additional skuData entries separately for these shared attributes; instead, insert them to existing skuData entries by populating their respective fields.
- Do not associate the total Gross Weight, total Net Weight, or quantityShipped fields with any skuData entity. These fields are document-level fields and should not be associated with any skuData entity.

return only the extracted data in the json format excluding all other information.
