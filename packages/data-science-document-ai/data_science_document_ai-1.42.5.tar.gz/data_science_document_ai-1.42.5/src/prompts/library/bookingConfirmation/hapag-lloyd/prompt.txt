mblNumber: The Master Bill of Lading number.
pickUpReference: A reference code for cargo pickup.
pickUpTerminal: The specific terminal for cargo pickup.

    portOfLoading: The port where cargo is loaded for a specific leg.
    vesselName: The name of the vessel for a specific leg.
    voyage: The journey or route taken by the vessel for a specific leg.

your task is to extract the text value of the following entities and page numbers starting from 0 where the value was found in the document:
SCHEMA_PLACEHOLDER

Keywords for datapoints:
- bookingNumber: Our Reference
- cyCutOff: FCL delivery cut-off
- gateInReference: Our Reference
- gateInTerminal: Export terminal delivery address
- mblNumber: BL/SWB No(s).
- pickUpReference: Export door positioning address(es)
- siCutOff: shipping instruction closing
- vgmCutOff: VGM cut-off
- eta: eta, ETA
- etd: etd, ETD
- imoNumber: IMO No, IMO number
- portOfDischarge: to
- portOfLoading: from
- vesselName: vessel
- voyage: Voy. no

Table Structure to extract transportLegs:
- transportLegs table has following colum names: From, To, By, ETD, ETA
- If the first leg does not have an ETD and ETA, Also By column includes following info: ["Truck", "Combined Waterway"]; skip the row, start from one row below.

Further explanation for the transportLegs part as follows:
- you must differentiate the Voyage from DP Voyage. Never used the value with the key 'DP Voyage'.
- Vessel name is in 'By' column and under the key Vessel
- 'eta' must be equal or later than 'etd'!
- portOfLoading and portOfDischarge are name of the Ports. You can rely on the port names from all over the world.
- portOfLoading and portOfDischarge distinctly denotes the name of the ports. If you find abbreviation of the port use it, if not you can use the full name of the port
- Abbreviations most likely to be in the parentheses like follows (DEHAM).
- Don't use the same voyage or vesselName value more than once!
- transportLegs are separated by a horizontal line within a table.

Further explanation for datapoints except transportLegs part as follows:
- If gateInReference is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.
- If pickUpReference is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.
- If mblNumber is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.

You must apply the following rules:
- The JSON schema must be followed during the extraction.
- The values must only include text found in the document
- Do not normalize any entity value.
- If an entity is not found in the document, keep it empty or np.Nan.
- Validate the JSON make sure its a valid JSON ! No extra text, no missing comma!
