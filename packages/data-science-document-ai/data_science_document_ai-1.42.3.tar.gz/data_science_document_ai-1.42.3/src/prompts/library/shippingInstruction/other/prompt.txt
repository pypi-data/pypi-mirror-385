Task: Extract data from the provided shipping instruction PDF document and populate the following dictionary based on the given schema.
Your task is to extract the text value of the following entities and page numbers starting from 0 where the value was found in the document:

### Instructions:
1. Extract all data points from the shipping instruction document.
2. Each extracted data point must be part of a master field called "containers". There may be multiple "containers" entries in the document. Ensure you extract details for all instances.
3. "Containers" Data Fields:
   - Fill in the data fields as per the response schema provided.
   - Always search for the Quantity mentioned as pallets, PLT, cartons, CTNS, pieces, PCS, packages, boxes, etc...
   - If a field such as `containerNumber`, `sealNumber`, 'hsCode' or any other fields are not found within the "containers" section, search for these fields elsewhere in the document. Once located, populate the respective fields in all relevant "containers" entities.
   - If the document contains only one container, use the total values for attributes like `grossWeight`, `netWeight`, `measurements`, and `packageQuantity` to populate the single container entry.
   - Avoid creating separate entries for these shared attributes; instead, merge the data into the existing "containers" entries.

4. Output:
   - Return the extracted data in JSON format.
   - Exclude all other information from the response.
