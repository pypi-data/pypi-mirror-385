r1,5,rel,highest reliability,"verified(a) data based on measurements(b)","(a) verification may take place in several ways,e.g. by on-site checking, by recalculation,through mass balances or cross-checks with other sources; (b) includes caculated data (e.g.,emissions calculated from inputs to an activity),when the basis for calculation is measurements (e.g. measured inputs). If the calculation is based partly on assumptions, the score would be 2 or 3"
