gen1,general score - highest quality,from official statistical agency or own measurement,
gen2,general score - high quality,from external source,
gen3,general score - average quality,calculated,
gen4,general score - low quality,estimated using proxy,
gen5,general score - lowest quality,estimated as residual,
r1,pedigree score - highest reliability,verified(a) data based on measurements(b),"(a) verification may take place in several ways,e.g. by on-site checking, by recalculation,through mass balances or cross-checks with other sources; (b) includes caculated data (e.g.,emissions calculated from inputs to an activity),when the basis for calculation is measurements (e.g. measured inputs). If the calculation is based partly on assumptions, the score would be 2 or 3"
r2,pedigree score - high reliability,verified data partly based on assumptions or non-verified data based on measurements,
r3,pedigree score - average reliability,non-verified data partly based on qualified estimates,
r4,pedigree score - low reliability,qualified estimate (e.g. by industrial expert),
r5,pedigree score - lowest reliability,non-qualified estimate,
c1,pedigree score - highest completeness,"representative data from all sites relevant for the market considered,over an adequate period to even out normal fluctuations",
c2,pedigree score - high completeness,"representative data from >50% of the sites relevant for the market considered, over an adequate period to even out normal fluctuations",
c3,pedigree score - average completeness,representative data from only some sites (<<50%) relevant for the market considered or >50% of sites but from shorter periods,
c4,pedigree score - low completeness,representative data from only one site relevant for the market considered or some sites but from shorter periods,
c5,pedigree score - lowest completeness,reresentativeness unknown or data from a small number of sites and from shorter periods,
t1,pedigree score - highest temporal correlation,less than 3 years of difference to the time period of the dataset,
t2,pedigree score - high temporal correlation,less than 6 years of difference to the time period of the dataset,
t3,pedigree score - average temporal correlation,less than 10 years of difference to the time period of the dataset,
t4,pedigree score - low temporal correlation,less than 15 years of difference to the time period of the dataset,
t5,pedigree score - lowest temporal correlation,age of data unknown or more than 15 years of difference to the time period of the dataset,
g1,pedigree score - highest geographical correlation,data from area under study,
g2,pedigree score - high geographical correlation,average data from larger area in which the area under study is included,
g3,pedigree score - average geographical correlation,data from area with similar production conditions,
g4,pedigree score - low geographical correlation,data from area with slightly similar production conditions,
g5,pedigree score - lowest geographical correlation,"data from unknown or distinct different area (North America instead of Middle East,OECD-Europe instead of Russia)",
f1,pedigree score - highest further technological correlation,"data from enterprises,processes and materials unders study",
f2,pedigree score - high further technological correlation,data from processes and materials under study (i.e. identical technology) but from different enterprises,
f3,pedigree score - average further technological correlation,data from processes and materials under study from different technology,
f4,pedigree score - low further technological correlation,data on related processes or materials,
f5,pedigree score - lowest further technological correlation,data on related processes on laboratory scale or from different technology,
