iSponsorBlockTV is a self-hosted application that connects to your YouTube TV
app (see compatibility below) and automatically skips segments (like Sponsors
or intros) in YouTube videos using the [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
API. It can also auto mute and press the "Skip Ad" button the moment it becomes
available on YouTube ads.

## Usage

Run iSponsorBlockTV on a computer that has network access. It doesn't need to
be on the same network as the device, only access to youtube.com is required.

Auto discovery will require the computer to be on the same network as the device
during setup.
The device can also be manually added to iSponsorBlockTV with a YouTube TV code.
This code can be found in the settings page of your YouTube TV application.

## Libraries used

- [pyytlounge](https://github.com/FabioGNR/pyytlounge) Used to interact with the
  device
- asyncio and [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)
- [async-cache](https://github.com/iamsinghrajat/async-cache)
- [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual/) Used for the amazing new
  graphical configurator
- [ssdp](https://github.com/codingjoe/ssdp) Used for auto discovery
