# Cythonized core modules for PHYSBO

This package contains the cythonized core modules for [PHYSBO](https://github.com/issp-center-dev/PHYSBO).
Originally, PHYSBO used Cython to speed up the performance of the core modules, but it requires a bit extra effort to build particularly on windows.
To simplify the build process, we moved the cythonized core modules to this package, and users can use PHYSBO without Cython (pure python).
If users want to improve the performance, they can install this package and use the cythonized core modules again.
