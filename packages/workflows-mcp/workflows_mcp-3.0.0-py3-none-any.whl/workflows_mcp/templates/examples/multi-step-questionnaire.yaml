# Multi-Step Questionnaire Workflow
#
# Demonstrates multiple interactive blocks with context accumulation:
# - Multiple pause/resume cycles in a single workflow
# - Context preservation across pauses
# - Different interactive block types (ConfirmOperation, AskChoice, GetInput)
# - Variable references to previous interactive responses
# - Progressive data collection from LLM
#
# This workflow simulates a project setup wizard that collects
# configuration through multiple interactive questions.
#
# Workflow steps:
# 1. Confirm project creation (ConfirmOperation)
# 2. Select project type (AskChoice)
# 3. Enter project name (GetInput with validation)
# 4. Select deployment target (AskChoice)
# 5. Generate configuration based on responses
# 6. Confirm final setup (ConfirmOperation)
# 7. Create project files
#
# Each interactive block pauses the workflow, creates a checkpoint,
# and waits for LLM response before continuing.
#
# Usage:
#   # Start workflow
#   result = execute_workflow("multi-step-questionnaire")
#
#   # Will pause 4 times for user input
#   # Each pause returns checkpoint_id and prompt
#   # Resume with: resume_workflow(checkpoint_id, response)

# How to use this workflow:
#
# This workflow demonstrates multiple pause/resume cycles:
#
# 1. First execution - pauses at confirm_start:
#    execute_workflow("multi-step-questionnaire")
#    → {"status": "paused", "checkpoint_id": "pause_001", "prompt": "Start wizard?"}
#
# 2. Resume with "yes" - pauses at select_project_type:
#    resume_workflow("pause_001", "yes")
#    → {"status": "paused", "checkpoint_id": "pause_002", "prompt": "Select project type..."}
#
# 3. Resume with choice number - pauses at get_project_name:
#    resume_workflow("pause_002", "1")
#    → {"status": "paused", "checkpoint_id": "pause_003", "prompt": "Enter project name..."}
#
# 4. Resume with project name - pauses at select_deployment:
#    resume_workflow("pause_003", "my-awesome-app")
#    → {"status": "paused", "checkpoint_id": "pause_004", "prompt": "Select deployment..."}
#
# 5. Resume with deployment choice - pauses at confirm_creation:
#    resume_workflow("pause_004", "Docker Container")
#    → {"status": "paused", "checkpoint_id": "pause_005", "prompt": "Create project?"}
#
# 6. Resume with final confirmation - completes workflow:
#    resume_workflow("pause_005", "yes")
#    → {"status": "success", "outputs": {...}}
#
# Key features demonstrated:
# - Multiple pause/resume cycles in single workflow
# - Context accumulation across pauses
# - Variable references to previous responses
# - Different interactive block types
# - Conditional execution based on responses
# - Validation of user input (project name regex)
# - Final confirmation before side effects
#
# Checkpoint management:
# - Each pause creates a new checkpoint
# - Old checkpoints remain valid (can go back)
# - Use list_checkpoints() to see all paused states
# - Use delete_checkpoint() to clean up
# - Paused checkpoints don't auto-expire
