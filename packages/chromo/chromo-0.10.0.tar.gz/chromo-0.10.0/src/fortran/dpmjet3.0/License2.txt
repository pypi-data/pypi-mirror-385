Copyright Holders) 1995-2008.

All rights not expressly granted under this license are reserved.

This software results from work performed by Ralph Engel, Johannes Ranft
and Stefan Roesler (the Authors).

The Authors are the exclusive source of distribution of the code, bug
fixes and documentation of the DPMJET-III software. Each official 
version of DPMJET-III is identified by a numbering scheme specifying 
major and minor releases.

The Authors are able to grant any of the permissions noted in this 
License Agreement as requiring a specific consent. Any such consent 
may only be granted in writing.

DPMJET-III contains PHOJET and PYTHIA Version 6.1 as integral parts.
The license conditions given below apply also to PHOJET and PYTHIA 
Version 6.1. Torbjorn Sjostrand (Lund University) is the copright holder 
of the PYTHIA subpackage.

1. Installation, use, reproduction, display of the DPMJET-III 
software in source and binary forms, are permitted free of charge on a
non-exclusive basis for internal scientific, non-commercial and
non-weapon-related use by non-profit organizations only. Any exercise of
these rights is subject to the following conditions:
 
Insertion of the DPMJET-III code, in whole or in part, into other 
codes, or its translation into any other computer language are 
possible only after obtaining prior written permission. Modifications 
of the DPMJET-III code are permitted for use by the licensee only, 
unless authorized in written.


2. DPMJET-III is non-transferable, non-sub-licensable and may 
not be distributed in any way, without express written consent, 
whether in original or modified form, Site-wise or collaboration-wise
conditions can be agreed with the Authors.


3. Notwithstanding the above, the licensee may modify and 
sub-license DPMJET-III User Routines to third parties in so far 
as their  purpose is limited to the adaptation of input and output 
interfaces of DPMJET-III and their modification does not circumvent,
replace, add to or modify any of the functions of DPMJET-III, 
or extract specific isolated results from any of the individual 
internal physics models embedded within DPMJET-III.


4. The licensee shall forthwith license all its modifications of
DPMJET-III to the DPMJET-III  Authors, at no cost and with no
limitation of use. The licensee acknowledges that the DPMJET-III 
Authors may insert such modifications into future releases of 
DPMJET-III,  subject to appropriate acknowledgment of 
the licensees contribution.

or results obtained from it shall explicitly acknowledge DPMJET-III,
PHOJET and PYTHIA by quoting its set of references and the DPMJET-III 
Authors.  The licensee shall not without prior written permission 
publish documents or results based on a modified form of DPMJET-III, 
unless the modification exclusively concerns  User Routines for the 
adaptation of its input and output interfaces which comply with the 
same restrictions, as defined in section 3) as those which apply 
to sub-licensing. Any publication of documents or results shall be 
based only on official DPMJET-III versions as obtained  from the 
Authors. Publication here implies any legal publication to any third
party, whether verbal, electronic, visual, in writing or otherwise.

references, copyright statement and license conditions are not 
altered or removed from DPMJET-III. Any integration of 
any portion of DPMJET-III in modified or in
unmodified form, into any other software package must preserve the
internal copyright notices in those portions of DPMJET-III
that have been employed, and must reproduce such notices 
within any additional global notices included along or embedded 
within the software into which DPMJET-III has been integrated. 
Any portion of DPMJET-III so integrated, whether modified or 
unmodified shall continue to be subject to these license conditions.


7. Versions or parts of the DPMJET-III source code, 
entrusted to individuals or groups prior to the formulation of this
