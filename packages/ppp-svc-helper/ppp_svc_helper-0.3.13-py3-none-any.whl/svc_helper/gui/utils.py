def get_sanitized_filename(full_path: str, max_length: int = 200) -> str:
    """
    Sanitizes a filename by removing/replacing invalid characters, truncating it
    to a specified maximum length, and adding an incrementing number before
    the extension to prevent overwriting existing files. It checks for existence
    within the parent directory of the provided full_path.

    Args:
        full_path (str): The full desired path, including the original filename.
                         The existence check will be performed in its parent directory.
        max_length (int): The maximum allowed length for the base filename
                          (before extension and incrementing number).
                          Default is 200 characters, leaving room for
                          extension and a potential increment.

    Returns:
        str: A unique, sanitized, and truncated file path
