       echo 'debconf debconf/frontend select Noninteractive' | debconf-set-selections && \
    $ apt-get install -y -q dialog apt-utils && \
    $ apt-get install -y -q \
          bzip2 \

          gdb \
          make \
          nano \
          python3-pip \
          tree \
          wget \
          cron \
          zip \
          unzip \
          vim \
          bash-completion \
          git \
          git-lfs && \
    $ git-lfs install

    $ mamba activate base
    $ mamba update all

1. Clone the repository::

    $ git clone git@git.gfz-potsdam.de:global-land-monitoring/enmap_downloader.git

    $ cd enmap_downloader/
    $ mamba env create -f enmap_downloader/tests/CI_docker/context/environment_enmap_downloader.yml
    $ pip install .

3. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests::

    $ make pytest
    $ make lint
    $ make urlcheck


5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitLab::
