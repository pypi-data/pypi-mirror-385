## Introduction

`imbalanced-learn-extra` is a Python package that extends [imbalanced-learn]. It implements algorithms that are not included in
[imbalanced-learn] due to their novelty or lower citation number. The current version includes the following:

- A general interface for clustering-based oversampling algorithms.

- The Geometric SMOTE algorithm. It is a geometrically enhanced drop-in replacement for SMOTE, that handles numerical as well as
categorical features.

## Installation

For user installation, `imbalanced-learn-extra` is currently available on the PyPi's repository, and you can
install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install imbalanced-learn-extra
```

Development installation requires cloning the repository and then using [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to install the
project as well as the main and development dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/georgedouzas/imbalanced-learn-extra.git
cd imbalanced-learn-extra
pdm install
```

SOM clusterer requires optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install imbalanced-learn-extra[som]
```

## Usage

All the classes included in `imbalanced-learn-extra` follow the [imbalanced-learn] API using the functionality of the base
oversampler. Using [scikit-learn] convention, the data are represented as follows:

- Input data `X`: 2D array-like or sparse matrices.
- Targets `y`: 1D array-like.

The oversamplers implement a `fit` method to learn from `X` and `y`:

```python
oversampler.fit(X, y)
```

They also implement a `fit_resample` method to resample `X` and `y`:

```python
X_resampled, y_resampled = clustering_based_oversampler.fit_resample(X, y)
```
