Time is one of the most valuable resources for a human researcher, best spent
on thinking, exploring, and creating in the world of ideas. With Alithia, we
aim to open a new frontier in research assistance. Alithia aspires to be your
powerful research companion: from reading papers to pursuing interest-driven
deep investigations, from reproducing experiments to detecting fabricated
results, from tracking down relevant papers to monitoring industrial
breakthroughs. At its core, Alithia forges a strong and instant link between your personal
research profile, the latest state-of-the-art developments, and pervasive cloud
resources, ensuring you stay informed, empowered, and ahead.
