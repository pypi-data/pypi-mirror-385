Zsh grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

> [!NOTE]
> this is not the same as [tree-sitter/tree-sitter-zsh](https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-zsh) 
> which has been archived, but rather a complete reworking starting
> from the bash grammar.

### Known issues:
 
Glob qualifier delimeters for 's::' and 'n::' and 'b::' must be ':' rather
than arbitrary paired chars.

## Installation

For neovim, add the following to your config 

```lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
        pattern = "TSUpdate",
        callback = function()
            require("nvim-treesitter.parsers").zsh = {
                install_info = {
                    "https://github.com/georgeharker/tree-sitter-zsh",
                    generate_from_json = false, -- only needed if repo does not contain `src/grammar.json` either
                    queries = 'queries', -- also install queries from given directory
                },
                tier = 3,
            }
        end,
    })

```
