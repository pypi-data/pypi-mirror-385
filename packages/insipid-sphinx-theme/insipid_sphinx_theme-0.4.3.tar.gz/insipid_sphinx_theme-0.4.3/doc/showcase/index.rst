This Documentation
------------------

The documentation pages you are reading right now
are meant to be a showcase for how
certain Sphinx features look with the ``insipid`` theme.

The following pages try to show all HTML constructs that can be created with
Sphinx.

If you notice that something is missing, please create a bug report at
https://github.com/mgeier/insipid-sphinx-theme/issues/!
