**A microscope for neural networks** - Comprehensive framework for building, training, and diagnosing multi-layer perceptrons with advanced monitoring and visualization capabilities.

## Features

### Modern MLP Implementation
- **Flexible Architecture**: Arbitrary layer sizes with customizable activations
- **Advanced Optimizers**: 5 production-ready optimizers validated against literature
  - **SGD**: Classic stochastic gradient descent (Robbins & Monro, 1951)
  - **SGD+Momentum**: Polyak momentum for accelerated convergence (Polyak, 1964)
  - **SGD+Nesterov**: Lookahead momentum for superior convergence (Nesterov, 1983)
  - **RMSprop**: Adaptive learning rates (Hinton, 2012) with optional Nesterov
  - **Adam**: Default choice with bias-corrected moments (Kingma & Ba, 2014)
- **Smart Initialization**: He, Xavier, SELU, and intelligent auto-selection
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization, dropout with multiple variants
- **Model Persistence**: Complete save/load system with optimizer state preservation

### High-Performance Training
- **Ultra-Fast Training**: `fit_fast()` method with $\approx$ 5-10× speedup over standard training
- **Memory Efficient**: 60-80% memory reduction with optimized batch processing
- **Flexible Performance**: Choose between speed (`fit_fast()`) and diagnostics (`fit()`)

### Comprehensive Diagnostics
- **Pre-Training Analysis**: Architecture validation, weight initialization checks
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Dead neuron detection, gradient flow analysis and 8 other moitors
- **Post-Training Evaluation**: Robustness testing, performance profiling
- **Research-Validated Metrics**: Based on established deep learning principles

### High Quality Visualization
- **Training Dynamics**: Learning curves, loss landscapes, convergence analysis
- **Network Internals**: Activation distributions, gradient flows, weight evolution
- **Diagnostic Plots**: Health indicators, training stability metrics
- **Interactive Animations**: Training progress visualization

### Developer Experience
- **Clean API**: Intuitive interface with sensible defaults
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and runtime validation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 60%+ test coverage with property-based testing
- **Production Ready**: Extensive documentation, CI/CD, and quality assurance

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.11+ (3.12 recommended)
- **Core Dependencies**: NumPy 2.3+, Matplotlib 3.10+
- **Optional**: Jupyter for interactive examples

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI (recommended)
pip install neuroscope

# Install from source (development)
git clone https://github.com/ahmadrazacdx/neuro-scope.git
cd neuro-scope
pip install -e .
```

### Fast Training

```python
import numpy as np
from neuroscope import MLP

# Create and configure model
model = MLP([784, 128, 64, 10], 
           hidden_activation="relu", 
           out_activation="softmax")

# Choose your optimizer: "adam", "sgd", "sgdm", "sgdnm", "rmsprop"
model.compile(optimizer="adam", lr=1e-3)

# Ultra-fast training - ~5-10× speedup!
history = model.fit_fast(
    X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
    epochs=100, 
    batch_size=256,
    eval_freq=5 
)

# Save trained model
model.save("my_model.ns", save_optimizer=True)

# Load and use later
loaded_model = MLP.load("my_model.ns", load_optimizer=True)
predictions = loaded_model.predict(X_test)
```

### Full Diagnostic Training

```python
from neuroscope import MLP, PreTrainingAnalyzer, TrainingMonitor, Visualizer

# Create model
model = MLP([784, 128, 64, 10])
model.compile(optimizer="adam", lr=1e-3)

# Pre-training analysis
analyzer = PreTrainingAnalyzer(model)
pre_results = analyzer.analyze(X_train, y_train)

# Train with comprehensive monitoring
monitor = TrainingMonitor()
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val,
                   epochs=100, monitor=monitor)

# Visualize results
viz = Visualizer(history)
viz.plot_learning_curves()
viz.plot_activation_hist()
```

### Direct Function Access

```python
from neuroscope import mse, accuracy_binary, relu, he_init

# Use functions directly without class instantiation
loss = mse(y_true, y_pred)
acc = accuracy_binary(y_true, y_pred)
activated = relu(z)
weights, biases = he_init([784, 128, 10])
```
