**Data overview**

- Task:
  - 10 participants
  - Walking at three speeds: Slow, Normal and Fast 
  - Speed conditions encoded as 1=Slow, 2=Normal, 3=Fast
  - 20 repetititions each condition
  - 60 total trials per participant
  - 600 total trials
- Measurements:
  - Walking speed (average progression-direction speed of a single reflective marker attached to subject's torso)
  - 2D plantar pressure distribution;  in this dataset only the maximum pressure distribution is available (maximum pressure at each sensor = each pixel over stance phase)
