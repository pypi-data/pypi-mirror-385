Right now, there are 2 different approaches for AI integration with Odoo:

1. Make everything inside Odoo.
2. Make it using other tools and integrate Odoo with these tools.

IMO, it would be better to make use of option 2 for different reasons:

- Odoo server is intended as a transactional system. AI systems requires other kind of characteristics
- Everything changes too fast. I am not confident that Odoo can keep the pace in this topic
- There are OSS tools that fills the gap perfectly and are created just for this topic.

Anyway, OCA is open to everyone and we don't intend to force an opinionated way of doing. For this reason, we have this module, that can be used as Bridge with AI systems.
