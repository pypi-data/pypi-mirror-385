# Domain-specific applicability defaults
domain_applicability_defaults:
  transport:
    default_level: "high"
    reason: "Transport studies require comprehensive diagnostics"
    
  equilibrium:
    default_level: "high" 
    reason: "Equilibrium reconstruction needs multiple measurements"
    
  heating:
    default_level: "high"
    reason: "Heating studies require power and profile measurements"
    
  edge_physics:
    default_level: "moderate"
    reason: "Edge diagnostics often specialized and localized"
    
  divertor:
    default_level: "moderate"
    reason: "Divertor diagnostics specialized for high heat flux regions"
    
  default:
    default_level: "low"
    reason: "General applicability assumed low unless specified"
