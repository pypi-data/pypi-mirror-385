  description: Remove a redundant index from the array `.slice()` method.
    # Note this is somewhat different to the Python version
  explanation: |
    Parameters in the array prototype `.slice(start, end)` method are optional, and by convention you should only use
    the necessary ones, to simplify readability. The `end` is not necessary if you want to slice to the end of the
    array. The `start` is additionally not necessary if you want to slice from the start of the array.
  language:
  - javascript
  - typescript
  tags:
  - default
  any:
  - pattern: ${arr}.slice(${start}, ${arr}.length)
    replacement: ${arr}.slice(${start})
  - pattern: ${arr}.slice(0)
    replacement: ${arr}.slice()
  tests:
  - match: const toEnd = numbers.slice(3, numbers.length)
    expect: const toEnd = numbers.slice(3)
  - match: const copy = numbers.slice(0, numbers.length)
    expect: const copy = numbers.slice(0)
  - match: const copy = numbers.slice(0)
    expect: const copy = numbers.slice()
  - no-match: const sub = numbers.slice(1, 5)
  - no-match: const sub = numbers.slice(1)
