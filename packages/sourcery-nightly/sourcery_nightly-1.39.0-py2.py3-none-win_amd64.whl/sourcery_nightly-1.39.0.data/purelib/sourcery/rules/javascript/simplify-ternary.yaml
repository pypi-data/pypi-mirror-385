  description: Avoid unneeded ternary statements
  explanation: |
    It is possible to simplify certain ternary statements into either use of an `||` or `!`.
    This makes the code easier to read, since there is no conditional logic.
  language:
  - javascript
  - typescript
  tags:
  - default
  any:
  - pattern: |
      ${left} ? ${left} : ${right}
    replacement: |
      ${left} || ${right}
  - pattern: |
      ${value} ? true : false
    replacement: |
      !!${value}
  - pattern: |
      ${value} ? false : true
    replacement: |
      !${value}
  tests:
  - match: |
      const foo = a ? a : b;
    expect: |
      const foo = a || b;
  - match: |
      const bar = c ? true : false;
    expect: |
      const bar = !!c;
  - match: |
      const baz = c ? false : true;
    expect: |
      const baz = !c;
