    @public

    TaskDocument is used for intermediate data that exists only during
    the execution of a Prefect task and is not persisted to disk. These
    documents are ideal for temporary processing results, transformations,
    and data that doesn't need to survive beyond the current task.

    Key characteristics:
    - Not persisted to file system
    - Exists only during task execution
    - Garbage collected after task completes
    - Used for intermediate processing results
    - Reduces persistent I/O for temporary data

    Creating TaskDocuments:
        Same as Document - use `create()` for automatic conversion, `__init__` for bytes.
        See Document.create() for detailed usage examples.

    Use Cases:
        - Intermediate transformation results
        - Temporary buffers during processing
        - Task-local cache data
        - Processing status documents

    Note:
        - Cannot instantiate TaskDocument directly - must subclass
        - Not saved by simple_runner utilities
        - Reduces I/O overhead for temporary data
        - No additional abstract methods to implement
