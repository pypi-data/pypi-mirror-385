"""Core configuration settings for pipeline operations.

@public

This module provides the Settings base class for configuration management.
Applications should inherit from Settings to create their own ProjectSettings
class with additional configuration fields.

Environment variables:
    OPENAI_BASE_URL: LiteLLM proxy endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:4000)
    OPENAI_API_KEY: API key for LiteLLM proxy authentication
    PREFECT_API_URL: Prefect server endpoint for flow orchestration
    PREFECT_API_KEY: Prefect API authentication key
    LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY: Laminar project key for observability
    GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE: Path to GCS service account JSON file

Configuration precedence:
    1. Environment variables (highest priority)
    2. .env file in current directory
    3. Default values (empty strings)

Example:
    >>> from ai_pipeline_core import Settings
    >>>
    >>> # Create your project's settings class
    >>> class ProjectSettings(Settings):
    ...     app_name: str = "my-app"
    ...     debug_mode: bool = False
    >>>
    >>> # Create singleton instance
    >>> settings = ProjectSettings()
    >>>
    >>> # Access configuration
    >>> print(settings.openai_base_url)
    >>> print(settings.app_name)

.env file format:
    OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-1234567890
    PREFECT_API_URL=http://localhost:4200/api
    PREFECT_API_KEY=pnu_abc123
    LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=lmnr_proj_xyz
    GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=/path/to/service-account.json
    APP_NAME=production-app
    DEBUG_MODE=false

Note:
    Settings are loaded once at initialization and frozen. There is no
    built-in reload mechanism - the process must be restarted to pick up
    changes to environment variables or .env file. This is by design to
    ensure consistency during execution.

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """Base configuration class for AI Pipeline applications.

    @public

    Settings is designed to be inherited by your application's configuration
    class. It provides core AI Pipeline settings and type-safe configuration
    management with automatic loading from environment variables and .env files.
    All settings are immutable after initialization.

    Inherit from Settings to add your application-specific configuration:

        >>> from ai_pipeline_core import Settings
        >>>
        >>> class ProjectSettings(Settings):
        ...     # Your custom settings
        ...     app_name: str = "my-app"
        ...     max_retries: int = 3
        ...     enable_cache: bool = True
        >>>
        >>> # Create singleton instance for your app
        >>> settings = ProjectSettings()

    Core Attributes:
        openai_base_url: LiteLLM proxy URL for OpenAI-compatible API.
                        Required for all LLM operations. Usually
                        http://localhost:4000 for local development.

        openai_api_key: Authentication key for LiteLLM proxy. Required
                       for LLM operations. Format depends on proxy config.

        prefect_api_url: Prefect server API endpoint. Required for flow
                        deployment and remote execution. Leave empty for
                        local-only execution.

        prefect_api_key: Prefect API authentication key. Required only
                        when connecting to Prefect Cloud or secured server.

        lmnr_project_api_key: Laminar (LMNR) project API key for observability.
                              Optional but recommended for production monitoring.

        lmnr_debug: Debug mode flag for Laminar. Set to "true" to
                   enable debug-level logging. Empty string by default.

        gcs_service_account_file: Path to GCS service account JSON file.
                                  Used for authenticating with Google Cloud Storage.
                                  Optional - if not set, default credentials will be used.

    Configuration sources:
        - Environment variables (highest priority)
        - .env file in current directory
        - Default values in class definition

    Note:
        Empty strings are used as defaults to allow optional services.
        Check for empty values before using service-specific settings.
