# ===== ROUTING CONFIGURATION =====
# Success route: {success_node}
# Failure route: {failure_node}
# 
# Routing patterns you can implement:
# 1. Simple Success/Failure: Check last_action_success flag
# 2. Content-Based: Route based on data content or type
# 3. Conditional: Multiple conditions with different outcomes
# 4. State-Based: Route based on accumulated state
# 5. Dynamic: Calculate route based on complex logic
