                your service. If a ``revision`` is not specified, the latest ``ACTIVE`` revision is used. If you modify the task

                stops an old task after the new version is running.
            capacityProviderStrategy: The details of a capacity provider strategy. You can set a capacity provider when you

            deploymentConfiguration: Optional deployment parameters that control how many tasks run during the deployment and
                the ordering of stopping and starting tasks.
            availabilityZoneRebalancing: Indicates whether to use Availability Zone rebalancing for the service.
            networkConfiguration: An object representing the network configuration for the service.
            placementConstraints: An array of task placement constraint objects to update the service to use. If no value is
                specified, the existing placement constraints for the service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it
                will override any existing placement constraints defined for the service. To remove all existing placement
                constraints, specify an empty array.
            placementStrategy: The task placement strategy objects to update the service to use. If no value is specified, the
                existing placement strategy for the service will remain unchanged. If this value is specified, it will override the
                existing placement strategy defined for the service. To remove an existing placement strategy, specify an empty
                object.
            platformVersion: The platform version that your tasks in the service run on. A platform version is only specified
                for tasks using the Fargate launch type. If a platform version is not specified, the ``LATEST`` platform version is
                used. For more information, see `Fargate Platform Versions

                update a service's tasks to use a newer Docker image with the same image/tag combination (``my_image:latest``) or to
                roll Fargate tasks onto a newer platform version.
            healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds: The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler ignores
                unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing, VPC Lattice, and container health checks after a task has first started. If you
                don't specify a health check grace period value, the default value of ``0`` is used. If you don't use any of the
                health checks, then ``healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds`` is unused.
            deploymentController: The deployment controller to use for the service.
            enableExecuteCommand: If ``true``, this enables execute command functionality on all task containers.
            enableECSManagedTags: Determines whether to turn on Amazon ECS managed tags for the tasks in the service. For more
                information, see `Tagging Your Amazon ECS Resources

            loadBalancers: You must have a service-linked role when you update this property
            propagateTags: Determines whether to propagate the tags from the task definition or the service to the task. If no

class HealthCheck(Boto3Model):
    """
    An object representing a container health check. Health check parameters that are
    specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that exist in
    the container image (such as those specified in a parent image or from the image's
    Dockerfile). This configuration maps to the ``HEALTHCHECK`` parameter of docker run.

    The Amazon ECS container agent only monitors and reports on the health checks specified in the task definition. Amazon
    ECS does not monitor Docker health checks that are embedded in a container image and not specified in the container
    definition. Health check parameters that are specified in a container definition override any Docker health checks that
    exist in the container image.

    You can view the health status of both individual containers and a task with the DescribeTasks API operation or when
    viewing the task details in the console.

    The health check is designed to make sure that your containers survive agent restarts, upgrades, or temporary
    unavailability.

    Amazon ECS performs health checks on containers with the default that launched the container instance or the task.

    The following describes the possible ``healthStatus`` values for a container:

    * ``HEALTHY``-The container health check has passed successfully.
    * ``UNHEALTHY``-The container health check has failed.
    * ``UNKNOWN``-The container health check is being evaluated, there's no container health check defined, or Amazon ECS
      doesn't have the health status of the container.

    The following describes the possible ``healthStatus`` values based on the container health checker status of essential
    containers in the task with the following priority order (high to low):

    * ``UNHEALTHY``-One or more essential containers have failed their health check.
    * ``UNKNOWN``-Any essential container running within the task is in an ``UNKNOWN`` state and no other essential
      containers have an ``UNHEALTHY`` state.
    * ``HEALTHY``-All essential containers within the task have passed their health checks.

    Consider the following task health example with 2 containers.

    * If Container1 is ``UNHEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``UNKNOWN``, the task health is ``UNHEALTHY``.
    * If Container1 is ``UNHEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``HEALTHY``, the task health is ``UNHEALTHY``.
    * If Container1 is ``HEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``UNKNOWN``, the task health is ``UNKNOWN``.
    * If Container1 is ``HEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``HEALTHY``, the task health is ``HEALTHY``.

    Consider the following task health example with 3 containers.

    * If Container1 is ``UNHEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``UNKNOWN``, and Container3 is ``UNKNOWN``, the task health is
      ``UNHEALTHY``.
    * If Container1 is ``UNHEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``UNKNOWN``, and Container3 is ``HEALTHY``, the task health is
      ``UNHEALTHY``.
    * If Container1 is ``UNHEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``HEALTHY``, and Container3 is ``HEALTHY``, the task health is
      ``UNHEALTHY``.
    * If Container1 is ``HEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``UNKNOWN``, and Container3 is ``HEALTHY``, the task health is
      ``UNKNOWN``.
    * If Container1 is ``HEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``UNKNOWN``, and Container3 is ``UNKNOWN``, the task health is
      ``UNKNOWN``.
    * If Container1 is ``HEALTHY`` and Container2 is ``HEALTHY``, and Container3 is ``HEALTHY``, the task health is
      ``HEALTHY``.

    If a task is run manually, and not as part of a service, the task will continue its lifecycle regardless of its health
    status. For tasks that are part of a service, if the task reports as unhealthy then the task will be stopped and the
    service scheduler will replace it.

    When a container health check fails for a task that is part of a service, the following process occurs:

    1. The task is marked as ``UNHEALTHY``.
    2. The unhealthy task will be stopped, and during the stopping process, it will go through the following states:

    * ``DEACTIVATING`` - In this state, Amazon ECS performs additional steps before stopping the task. For example, for
      tasks that are part of services configured to use Elastic Load Balancing target groups, target groups will be
      deregistered in this state.
    * ``STOPPING`` - The task is in the process of being stopped.
    * ``DEPROVISIONING`` - Resources associated with the task are being cleaned up.
    * ``STOPPED`` - The task has been completely stopped.
    3. After the old task stops, a new task will be launched to ensure service operation, and the new task will go through
    the following lifecycle:

    * ``PROVISIONING`` - Resources required for the task are being provisioned.
    * ``PENDING`` - The task is waiting to be placed on a container instance.
    * ``ACTIVATING`` - In this state, Amazon ECS pulls container images, creates containers, configures task networking,
      registers load balancer target groups, and configures service discovery status.
    * ``RUNNING`` - The task is running and performing its work.

    For more detailed information about task lifecycle states, see `Task
    lifecycle <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-lifecycle-explanation.html>`_ in the *Amazon
    Elastic Container Service Developer Guide*.

    The following are notes about container health check support:

    * If the Amazon ECS container agent becomes disconnected from the Amazon ECS service, this won't cause a container to
      transition to an ``UNHEALTHY`` status. This is by design, to ensure that containers remain running during agent restarts
      or temporary unavailability. The health check status is the "last heard from" response from the Amazon ECS agent, so if
      the container was considered ``HEALTHY`` prior to the disconnect, that status will remain until the agent reconnects and
      another health check occurs. There are no assumptions made about the status of the container health checks.
    * Container health checks require version ``1.17.0`` or greater of the Amazon ECS container agent. For more information,
      see `Updating the Amazon ECS container agent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-
    update.html>`_.
    * Container health checks are supported for Fargate tasks if you're using platform version ``1.1.0`` or greater. For
      more information, see `Fargate platform
      versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html>`_.
    * Container health checks aren't supported for tasks that are part of a service that's configured to use a Classic Load
      Balancer.
