## 🚀 Proposed Extractions

### **Orchestrator.py Extractions**

#### 1. **Event Emission Module** (~110 lines)
**File:** `src/flock/orchestrator/event_emitter.py`

**Rationale:**
- Dashboard-specific logic (WebSocket events)
- Not core to orchestration logic
- Clean separation of concerns

**Methods to Extract:**
- `_emit_correlation_updated_event()` (~55 lines)
- `_emit_batch_item_added_event()` (~55 lines)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces orchestrator coupling to dashboard
- Makes orchestrator easier to test without dashboard
- Isolates WebSocket dependencies

---

#### 2. **Lifecycle Management Module** (~150 lines)
**File:** `src/flock/orchestrator/lifecycle_manager.py`

**Rationale:**
- Background task management (cleanup loops, timeout checkers)
- Self-contained async task coordination
- Batch/correlation lifecycle management

**Methods to Extract:**
- `_correlation_cleanup_loop()` (~20 lines)
- `_cleanup_expired_correlations()` (~10 lines)
- `_batch_timeout_checker_loop()` (~20 lines)
- `_check_batch_timeouts()` (~40 lines)
- `_flush_all_batches()` (~20 lines)

**Class Design:**
```python
class LifecycleManager:
    """Manages background tasks for batch/correlation cleanup."""

    def __init__(self, orchestrator: Flock):
        self._orchestrator = orchestrator
        self._correlation_cleanup_task: Task | None = None
        self._batch_timeout_task: Task | None = None
        self._cleanup_interval = 0.1

    async def start_correlation_cleanup(self) -> None:
        """Start background correlation cleanup loop."""

    async def start_batch_timeout_checker(self) -> None:
        """Start background batch timeout checker loop."""

    async def shutdown(self) -> None:
        """Cancel and cleanup all background tasks."""
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces orchestrator.py complexity
- Centralizes async task management
- Easier to test lifecycle logic in isolation

---

#### 3. **Execution Context Builder Module** (~100 lines)
**File:** `src/flock/orchestrator/context_builder.py`

**Rationale:**
- Pattern duplication: "evaluate context + create Context + execute" appears in 3 places
  - `direct_invoke()` (lines 557-627)
  - `invoke()` (lines 832-937)
  - `_run_agent_task()` (lines 1016-1088)
- Security-critical code (Phase 8 context provider pattern)
- Reduces C-rated complexity in `_run_agent_task`

**Methods to Extract:**
- Extract pattern into `build_execution_context()`

**Class Design:**
```python
class ContextBuilder:
    """Builds execution contexts with security boundary enforcement."""

    def __init__(self, orchestrator: Flock):
        self._orchestrator = orchestrator
        self._logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    async def build_execution_context(
        self,
        agent: Agent,
        artifacts: list[Artifact],
        *,
        is_batch: bool = False,
    ) -> Context:
        """Build Context with pre-filtered artifacts (Phase 8 security fix).

        Implements the security boundary pattern:
        1. Resolve provider (agent > global > default)
        2. Wrap with BoundContextProvider (prevent identity spoofing)
        3. Evaluate context artifacts (orchestrator controls READ)
        4. Create Context with data-only (no capabilities)

        Returns:
            Context with pre-filtered artifacts and agent identity
        """
```

**Benefits:**
- **DRY:** Eliminates code duplication across 3 methods
- **Security:** Centralizes security-critical context creation
- **Complexity:** Reduces `_run_agent_task` from C(11) to B or A
- **Testability:** Security boundary logic testable in isolation

---

#### 4. **Keep run_until_idle in orchestrator.py**

**Rationale:**
- C-rated (17 complexity), but it's orchestration coordination logic
- Breaking it apart would make it less readable
- Complexity is inherent to coordinating: pending tasks, batches, correlations, components, MCP
- Already well-documented with clear structure

**Recommendation:**
- Mark as "acceptable complexity" (architectural coordination)
- Consider extracting helper methods for readability if needed

---

### **Agent.py Extractions**

#### 5. **Builder Configuration Module** (~400 lines)
**File:** `src/flock/agent/builder_config.py`

**Rationale:**
- AgentBuilder is 500+ lines (50% of agent.py!)
- Fluent API methods are low complexity but high LOC
- Clean separation: building vs. runtime execution

**Methods to Extract:**
- ALL fluent API methods:
  - `description()`, `consumes()`, `publishes()`
  - `with_utilities()`, `with_engines()`, `with_tools()`, `with_context()`, `with_mcps()`
  - `best_of()`, `max_concurrency()`, `calls()`, `labels()`, `tenant()`, `prevent_self_trigger()`
  - `run()`, `then()`

**Class Design:**
```python
class AgentBuilderConfig:
    """Fluent API configuration for agent builders."""

    def __init__(self, agent: Agent, orchestrator: Flock):
        self._agent = agent
        self._orchestrator = orchestrator

    def description(self, text: str) -> AgentBuilderConfig:
        ...

    def consumes(self, *types, **kwargs) -> AgentBuilderConfig:
        ...

    # ... all other fluent API methods
```

**Updated AgentBuilder:**
```python
class AgentBuilder:
    """Thin wrapper delegating to AgentBuilderConfig."""

    def __init__(self, orchestrator: Flock, name: str):
        self._orchestrator = orchestrator
        self._agent = Agent(name, orchestrator=orchestrator)
        self._config = AgentBuilderConfig(self._agent, orchestrator)
        orchestrator.register_agent(self._agent)

    def __getattr__(self, item):
        """Delegate all fluent API calls to config."""
        return getattr(self._config, item)

    @property
    def agent(self) -> Agent:
        return self._agent
```

**Benefits:**
- **Size:** Reduces agent.py from 1,095 → ~700 lines (36% reduction)
- **Separation:** Clear split between building (config) vs. runtime (agent)
- **Testability:** Builder API testable independently

---

#### 6. **Builder Validation Module** (~100 lines)
**File:** `src/flock/agent/builder_validation.py`

**Rationale:**
- Validation logic is distinct from configuration
- Can be extracted with config module or standalone
- Low complexity but verbose (error messages)

**Methods to Extract:**
- `_validate_self_trigger_risk()` (~27 lines)
- `_validate_best_of()` (~11 lines)
- `_validate_concurrency()` (~11 lines)
- `_normalize_join()` (~21 lines)
- `_normalize_batch()` (~8 lines)

**Class Design:**
```python
class BuilderValidator:
    """Validation and normalization for agent builder configuration."""

    def __init__(self, agent: Agent):
        self._agent = agent

    def validate_self_trigger_risk(self) -> None:
        ...

    def validate_best_of(self, n: int) -> None:
        ...

    def normalize_join(self, value: dict | JoinSpec | None) -> JoinSpec | None:
        ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Groups related validation logic
- Easier to test validation rules
- Can be integrated with AgentBuilderConfig extraction

---

#### 7. **Helper Classes Module** (~100 lines)
**File:** `src/flock/agent/builder_helpers.py`

**Rationale:**
- PublishBuilder, RunHandle, Pipeline are helper classes
- Low complexity, but add LOC
- Can be extracted for cleaner agent.py

**Classes to Extract:**
- `PublishBuilder` (~20 lines)
- `RunHandle` (~20 lines)
- `Pipeline` (~15 lines)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces agent.py surface area
- Groups related "builder pattern" helpers
- Easier to maintain fluent API helpers

| **orchestrator.py** | 2 (run_until_idle, _run_agent_task) | 1 (run_until_idle) | **50%** |
| **agent.py** | 0 | 0 | Maintained |

---

## 🎯 Recommended Phasing

### **Phase 5A: Orchestrator Cleanup** (6-8 hours)
1. ✅ Extract EventEmitter (~2 hours)
2. ✅ Extract LifecycleManager (~2-3 hours)
3. ✅ Extract ContextBuilder (~2-3 hours)
4. ✅ Update tests + integration (~1 hour)

**Priority:** HIGH - Eliminates 1 C-rated method, reduces orchestrator to <1000 LOC

---

### **Phase 5B: Agent Builder Cleanup** (6-8 hours)
1. ✅ Extract BuilderConfig (~3 hours)
2. ✅ Extract BuilderValidator (~2 hours)
3. ✅ Extract BuilderHelpers (~1 hour)
4. ✅ Update tests + integration (~2 hours)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Agent already has good complexity, this is pure size optimization

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Orchestrator.py
- ✅ File size: 1,322 → <900 LOC (30%+ reduction)
- ✅ C-rated methods: 2 → 1 (50% improvement)
- ✅ All existing tests passing
- ✅ New unit tests for extracted modules
- ✅ Maintainability: A (maintained or improved)

### Agent.py
- ✅ File size: 1,095 → <650 LOC (40%+ reduction)
- ✅ C-rated methods: 0 → 0 (maintained)
- ✅ All existing tests passing
- ✅ New unit tests for extracted modules
- ✅ Maintainability: A (maintained or improved)

---

## 🚨 Risks & Considerations

### Low Risk
- ✅ EventEmitter: Dashboard-specific, clear boundaries
- ✅ LifecycleManager: Self-contained async task management
- ✅ BuilderHelpers: Independent helper classes

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ ContextBuilder: Security-critical code, requires careful testing
- ⚠️ BuilderConfig: Large API surface, integration testing needed

### Mitigation
1. **Comprehensive unit tests** for all extracted modules (following Phase 4 drift cleanup pattern)
2. **Integration tests** to ensure orchestrator <> modules work correctly
3. **Security review** for ContextBuilder extraction (critical boundary)

---

## 🔄 Alternative Approaches

### **Conservative Approach**
- Only extract EventEmitter + LifecycleManager (Phase 5A)
- Skip ContextBuilder (keep security code in orchestrator)
- Skip Agent extractions (already at A-rated maintainability)

**Pros:** Lower risk, faster execution
**Cons:** Misses 38% LOC reduction opportunity, leaves C-rated method

### **Aggressive Approach**
- Extract all 6 proposed modules
- Add additional extractions:
  - Orchestrator: Input normalization module
  - Agent: Engine resolution module

**Pros:** Maximum size reduction (45%+)
**Cons:** Higher risk, longer execution time, diminishing returns

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Proceed with Phase 5A (Orchestrator Cleanup) ONLY**

**Rationale:**
1. **Highest Impact:** Eliminates C-rated method, reduces orchestrator 30%
2. **Manageable Risk:** Clear module boundaries, security code stays centralized (ContextBuilder)
3. **Strategic Value:** Orchestrator is more critical than Agent for system architecture
4. **Agent is Fine:** agent.py already has excellent complexity (all A-rated), size is acceptable

**Defer Phase 5B** (Agent cleanup) unless:
- agent.py grows significantly in future phases
- Team feedback indicates builder API is hard to maintain
- We need to add extensive builder functionality

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Decision:** Review this proposal and decide on approach (5A, 5B, both, or alternative)
2. **Approval:** Get team sign-off on extraction strategy
3. **Implementation:** Execute chosen phase with test-first approach
4. **Validation:** Run full test suite, measure metrics, update progress.md

---

**Questions for Review:**
1. Should we prioritize orchestrator cleanup (5A) over agent cleanup (5B)?
2. Is ContextBuilder extraction worth the security review overhead?
3. Should we keep run_until_idle as "acceptable C-rated complexity"?
4. Any other modules you'd like to see extracted?
