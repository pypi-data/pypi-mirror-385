Audio System (aud)
******************

Audaspace (pronounced "outer space") is a high level audio library.


Basic Sound Playback
====================

This script shows how to use the classes: :class:`Device`, :class:`Sound` and
:class:`Handle`.

.. code::

  import aud

  device = aud.Device()
  # Load sound file (it can be a video file with audio).
  sound = aud.Sound('music.ogg')

  # Play the audio, this return a handle to control play/pause.
  handle = device.play(sound)
  # If the audio is not too big and will be used often you can buffer it.
  sound_buffered = aud.Sound.cache(sound)
  handle_buffered = device.play(sound_buffered)

  # Stop the sounds (otherwise they play until their ends).
  handle.stop()
  handle_buffered.stop()
