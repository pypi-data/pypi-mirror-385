File Path Foreach Flag Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:SKIP_LINKED:     
  Skip Linked.

  Skip paths of linked IDs.

:SKIP_PACKED:     
  Skip Packed.

  Skip paths when their matching data is packed.

:RESOLVE_TOKEN:   
  Resolve Token.

  Resolve tokens within a virtual filepath to a single, concrete, filepath. Currently only used for UDIM tiles.

:SKIP_WEAK_REFERENCES:
  Skip Weak References.

  Skip weak reference paths. Those paths are typically 'nice to have' extra information, but are not used as actual source of data by the current .blend file.

:SKIP_MULTIFILE:  
  Skip Multi-file.

  Skip paths where a single dir is used with an array of files, eg. sequence strip images or point-caches. In this case only the first file path is processed. This is needed for directory manipulation callbacks which might otherwise modify the same directory multiple times.

:RELOAD_EDITED:   
  Reload Edited.

  Reload data when the path is edited.
