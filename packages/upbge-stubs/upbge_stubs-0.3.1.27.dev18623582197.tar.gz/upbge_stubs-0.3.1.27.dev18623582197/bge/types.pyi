Game Types (bge.types)
**********************


Introduction
============

This module contains the classes that appear as instances in the Game Engine. A
script must interact with these classes if it is to affect the behaviour of
objects in a game.

The following example would move an object (i.e. an instance of
:class:`~bge.types.KX_GameObject`) one unit up.

.. code:: python

  # bge.types.SCA_PythonController
  cont = bge.logic.getCurrentController()

  # bge.types.KX_GameObject
  obj = cont.owner
  obj.worldPosition.z += 1

To run the code, it could be placed in a Blender text block and executed with
a :class:`~bge.types.SCA_PythonController` logic brick.

  joint_rotation: mathutils.Vector = ...

  """

  Control bone rotation in term of joint angle (for robotic applications), read-write.

  When writing to this attribute, you pass a [x, y, z] vector and an appropriate set of euler angles or quaternion is calculated according to the rotation_mode.

  When you read this attribute, the current pose matrix is converted into a [x, y, z] vector representing the joint angles.

  The value and the meaning of the x, y, z depends on the ik_dof_x/ik_dof_y/ik_dof_z attributes:

  * 1DoF joint X, Y or Z: the corresponding x, y, or z value is used an a joint angle in radiant

  * 2DoF joint X+Y or Z+Y: treated as 2 successive 1DoF joints: first X or Z, then Y. The x or z value is used as a joint angle in radiant along the X or Z axis, followed by a rotation along the new Y axis of y radiants.

  * 2DoF joint X+Z: treated as a 2DoF joint with rotation axis on the X/Z plane. The x and z values are used as the coordinates of the rotation vector in the X/Z plane.

  * 3DoF joint X+Y+Z: treated as a revolute joint. The [x, y, z] vector represents the equivalent rotation vector to bring the joint from the rest pose to the new pose.

  Note: The bone must be part of an IK chain if you want to set the ik_dof_x/ik_dof_y/ik_dof_z attributes via the UI, but this will interfere with this attribute since the IK solver will overwrite the pose. You can stay in control of the armature if you create an IK constraint but do not finalize it (e.g. don't set a target) the IK solver will not run but the IK panel will show up on the UI for each bone in the chain.

  Note: [0, 0, 0] always corresponds to the rest pose.

  Note: You must request the armature pose to update and wait for the next graphic frame to see the effect of setting this attribute (see :data:`BL_ArmatureObject.update <bge.types.BL_ArmatureObject.update>`).

  Note: You can read the result of the calculation in rotation or euler_rotation attributes after setting this attribute.

  You can only read the vertex properties of a mesh object. In upbge 0.3+, KX_MeshProxy,

when it was converted in BL_DataConversion.
Previously this kind of meshes were used both for render and physics, but since 0.3+,
it is only useful in limited cases. In most cases, bpy API should be used instead.

  Note:
The physics simulation doesn't currently update KX_Mesh/Poly/VertexProxy.

  1. Mesh Objects are converted from Blender at scene load.

  2. The Converter groups polygons by Material. A material holds:

     1. The texture.

     2. The Blender material.

     3. The Tile properties

     4. The face properties - (From the "Texture Face" panel)

     5. Transparency & z sorting

  3. Vertices will be split by face if necessary.  Vertices can only be shared between faces if:

     1. They are at the same position

     2. UV coordinates are the same

  Python component can be compared to python logic bricks with parameters.
The python component is a script loaded in the UI, this script defined a component class by inheriting from :class:`~bge.types.KX_PythonComponent`.
This class must contain a dictionary of properties: :attr:`args` and two default functions: :meth:`start` and :meth:`update`.

  The script must have .py extension.

  The component properties are loaded from the :attr:`args` attribute from the UI at loading time.
When the game start the function :meth:`start` is called with as arguments a dictionary of the properties' name and value.
The :meth:`update` function is called every frames during the logic stage before running logics bricks,
the goal of this function is to handle and process everything.

  The following component example moves and rotates the object when pressing the keys W, A, S and D.

  .. code:: python

    import bge
    from collections import OrderedDict

    class ThirdPerson(bge.types.KX_PythonComponent):
        \"\"\"Basic third person controls

        #

        args = OrderedDict([
            ("Move Speed", 0.1),
            ("Turn Speed", 0.04)
        ])

        def start(self, args):
            self.move_speed = args['Move Speed']
            self.turn_speed = args['Turn Speed']

        def update(self):
            keyboard = bge.logic.keyboard.events

            move = 0
            rotate = 0

            if keyboard[bge.events.WKEY]:
                move += self.move_speed

                move -= self.move_speed

                rotate += self.turn_speed
            if keyboard[bge.events.DKEY]:
                rotate -= self.turn_speed

            self.object.applyMovement((0, move, 0), True)
            self.object.applyRotation((0, 0, rotate), True)

  Since the components are loaded for the first time outside the bge, then :attr:`bge` is a fake module that contains only the class
:class:`~bge.types.KX_PythonComponent` to avoid importing all the bge modules.
This behavior is safer but creates some issues at loading when the user want to use functions or attributes from the bge modules other
than the :class:`~bge.types.KX_PythonComponent` class. The way is to not call these functions at loading outside the bge. To detect it, the bge
module contains the attribute :attr:`__component__` when it's imported outside the bge.

  The following component example add a "Cube" object at initialization and move it along x for each update. It shows that the user can
use functions from scene and load the component outside the bge by setting global attributes in a condition at the beginning of the
script.

  .. code:: python

    import bge

    if not hasattr(bge, "__component__"):
        global scene
        scene = bge.logic.getCurrentScene()

    class Component(bge.types.KX_PythonComponent):
        args = {}

        def start(self, args):
            scene.addObject("Cube")

        def update(self):
            scene.objects["Cube"].worldPosition.x += 0.1

  The property types supported are float, integer, boolean, string, set (for enumeration) and Vector 2D, 3D and 4D. The following example
show all of these property types.
