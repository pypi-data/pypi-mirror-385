.. _rna-enum-constraint-type-items:

**Motion Tracking**

:CAMERA_SOLVER:   
  Camera Solver.

:FOLLOW_TRACK:    
  Follow Track.

:OBJECT_SOLVER:   
  Object Solver.

**Transform**

:COPY_LOCATION:   
  Copy Location.

  Copy the location of a target (with an optional offset), so that they move together.

:COPY_ROTATION:   
  Copy Rotation.

  Copy the rotation of a target (with an optional offset), so that they rotate together.

:COPY_SCALE:      
  Copy Scale.

  Copy the scale factors of a target (with an optional offset), so that they are scaled by the same amount.

:COPY_TRANSFORMS: 
  Copy Transforms.

  Copy all the transformations of a target, so that they move together.

:LIMIT_DISTANCE:  
  Limit Distance.

  Restrict movements to within a certain distance of a target (at the time of constraint evaluation only).

:LIMIT_LOCATION:  
  Limit Location.

  Restrict movement along each axis within given ranges.

:LIMIT_ROTATION:  
  Limit Rotation.

  Restrict rotation along each axis within given ranges.

:LIMIT_SCALE:     
  Limit Scale.

  Restrict scaling along each axis with given ranges.

:MAINTAIN_VOLUME: 
  Maintain Volume.

  Compensate for scaling one axis by applying suitable scaling to the other two axes.

:TRANSFORM:       
  Transformation.

  Use one transform property from target to control another (or same) property on owner.

:TRANSFORM_CACHE: 
  Transform Cache.

  Look up the transformation matrix from an external file.

**Tracking**

:CLAMP_TO:        
  Clamp To.

  Restrict movements to lie along a curve by remapping location along curve's longest axis.

:DAMPED_TRACK:    
  Damped Track.

  Point towards a target by performing the smallest rotation necessary.

:IK:              
  Inverse Kinematics.

  Control a chain of bones by specifying the endpoint target (Bones only).

:LOCKED_TRACK:    
  Locked Track.

  Rotate around the specified ('locked') axis to point towards a target.

:SPLINE_IK:       
  Spline IK.

  Align chain of bones along a curve (Bones only).

:STRETCH_TO:      
  Stretch To.

  Stretch along Y-Axis to point towards a target.

:TRACK_TO:        
  Track To.

  Legacy tracking constraint prone to twisting artifacts.

**Relationship**

:ACTION:          
  Action.

  Use transform property of target to look up pose for owner from an Action.

:ARMATURE:        
  Armature.

  Apply weight-blended transformation from multiple bones like the Armature modifier.

:CHILD_OF:        
  Child Of.

  Make target the 'detachable' parent of owner.

:FLOOR:           
  Floor.

  Use position (and optionally rotation) of target to define a 'wall' or 'floor' that the owner cannot cross.

:FOLLOW_PATH:     
  Follow Path.

  Use to animate an object/bone following a path.

:GEOMETRY_ATTRIBUTE:
  Geometry Attribute.

  Retrieve transform from target geometry attribute data.

:PIVOT:           
  Pivot.

  Change pivot point for transforms (buggy).

:RIGID_BODY_JOINT:
  Rigid Body Joint.

  Use to define a Rigid Body Constraint (for Game Engine use only).

:SHRINKWRAP:      
  Shrinkwrap.

  Restrict movements to surface of target mesh.
