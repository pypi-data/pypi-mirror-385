        Warning:
            When mutli validators are initialized from URLs by this method, it is
            assumed that the auth server URL (used to perform OIDC discovery and
            locate all the other API endpoints) and the issuer (which is burned
            into the signed access tokens) are the same. This is normally
            true, but not universally required. For example, some network
            proxy configurations may make these different.

            This assumption is made in part to avoid the discovery lookup
            during construction. Since a network lookup could potentially fail,
            construction of the entire configuration could be rendered non-functional
            by a network or configuration problem impacting a single auth server.

            The multi-validator requires foreknowledge of all the issuers for
            proper initialization. So, without this assumption it would be unavoidable
            to introduce network risk into the constructor.  This assumption
            allows us to push all network errors to runtime, and avoids
            possible initialization time errors.
