# NMRCLUST algorithm implemented in python using numpy. Original algorithm DOI: 10.1093/protein/9.11.1063
# To use in your code, first compute rmsdMatrix
# Then 'communityAssignment = NRMCLUST(rmsdMatrix)'
# The file list corresponding to the axis of the rmsdMatrix will be assigned to clusters specified in communityAssignment
