# The Ward algorithm for conformational clustering is used in building Markov State Model (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b01238). To circumvent threshold selection, we will apply the dynamic tree cut method, used in conjunction to the Ward dendogram for automated conformational clustering (DOI: 10.1186/s13321-017-0208-0).
