Taguette
========

A spin on the phrase "tag it!", `Taguette <https://www.taguette.org/>`__ is a free and open source qualitative research tool that allows users to:

+ Import PDFs, Word Docs (``.docx``), Text files (``.txt``), HTML, EPUB, MOBI, Open Documents (``.odt``), and Rich Text Files (``.rtf``).
+ Highlight words, sentences, or paragraphs and tag them with the codes *you* create.
+ (not yet) Group imported documents together (e.g. as 'Interview' or 'Lit Review').
+ Export tagged documents, highlights for a specific tag, a list of tags with descriptions and colors, and whole projects.

Motivation and goal
-------------------

Qualitative methods generate rich, detailed research materials that leave individuals' perspectives intact as well as provide multiple contexts for understanding the phenomenon under study. Qualitative methods are used by a wide range of fields, such as anthropology, education, nursing, psychology, sociology, and marketing. Qualitative data has a similarly wide range: observations, interviews, documents, audiovisual materials, and more.

However - the software options for qualitative researchers are either **far too expensive**, don't allow for the seminal method of highlighting and tagging materials, *or actually perform quantitative analysis*, just on text.

**It's not right or fair that qualitative researchers without massive research funds cannot afford the basic software to do their research.**

So, to bolster a fair and equitable entry into qualitative methods, we've made Taguette!
