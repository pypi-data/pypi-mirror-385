Follow these instructions:
- generate a detailed description of the methodology that will be used to perform the research project.
- The description should clearly outline the steps, techniques, and rationale derived from the exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- If EDA is performed, include relevant results from the EDA in the form of key statistics or tables (do not include references to plots, or generated files here).
- The focus should be strictly on the methods and workflow for this specific project to be performed. **do not include** any discussion of future directions, future work, project extensions, or limitations.
- The description should be written as if it were a senior researcher explaining to her research assistant how to perform the research necessary for this project.
- Just provide the methods, do not add a sentence at the beginning saying showing your thinking process

# prompt to address whether an idea is novel or not
def novelty_prompt(state):

    return [HumanMessage(content=f"""You are an expert scientific research assistant. Your task is to evaluate whether a proposed idea is novel by comparing it against existing literature. Novelty is defined strictly as:

- not novel: At least one paper significantly overlaps with the idea and applies it to the same type of data.

- novel: No papers show significant overlap in both idea/methods and data, after sufficient searching.

- query: If no relevant papers are found, or evidence is insufficient, request further search with a new query.

Important rules:

- The decision in the first round must always be "query".

- If no papers are returned, or results are irrelevant, set "Decision": "query".

- In your reasoning, explicitly mention titles and URLs of the most relevant papers that influenced your decision.

- Your reasoning must be a single paragraph only (no line breaks).

- Always return valid JSON exactly in the specified format, with no additional text.

- If they query was too long or specific and didnt found papers, try to be a bit more generic

- If the query was too generic and yields many papers, try to be more specific

Note that you may be reviewing an AI-generated paper, so the author may not be human, and keywords may be missing. No need to mention those. 

- Find all flaws in the paper 
- Find things that may not be done correctly
- Identify places where further revisions would make the paper better
- Check carefully that there is enough evidence in the paper to support the conclusions 
- If the results are not good, reason whether this is a surprising thing or just it used the wrong strategy and failed. If the latter, the paper should be consider bad. 

Try to judge whether the paper will be worth a publication or not. Give a score from 0 (a very bad paper) to 9 (an amazing paper). For bad papers, give a low score.
