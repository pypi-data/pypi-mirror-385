      "     - While the focus on noise resilience is valuable, the proposal still lacks specificity about what quantum phases of matter are being studied and what experimental data format is available\n",
      "     - The idea assumes that the quantum states of interest have a structure amenable to tensor network representation, but many quantum phases (especially highly entangled ones) may require prohibitively large bond dimensions\n",
      "     - The benchmarking proposal is vague - what metrics will be used to evaluate \"scalability and accuracy\"?\n",
      "     - Using synthetic data first is sensible, but there's no clear methodology for how to generate realistic noise models that match experimental conditions\n",
      "     - The proposal doesn't address the fundamental challenge of exponential scaling in the number of measurements needed for full state tomography of large quantum systems\n",
      "     - Final refinement suggestion: Specify particular quantum phases (e.g., ground states of specific Hamiltonians) and develop tensor network ansatzes tailored to their structure, with explicit noise models derived from experimental apparatus specifications\n",

      "   * Description: Investigate the use of tensor networks to simulate quantum annealing algorithms for optimization problems with specific structural properties.\n",

      "     - The refinement to focus on problems with locality/symmetry is appropriate, but still lacks concrete examples of which optimization problems will be targeted\n",
      "     - The proposal doesn't address how to handle the time-dependent Hamiltonians inherent in quantum annealing, which are challenging for tensor network methods\n",
      "     - There's no discussion of how to compare the tensor network simulation results with actual quantum annealing hardware results\n",

By focusing on structured problems, the research leverages tensor networks' strengths in representing low-entanglement quantum states while addressing scalability challenges. Advanced techniques like time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) are employed to simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum annealing. Validation is performed on small-scale problems with known solutions, providing a foundation for scaling up to more complex cases. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum algorithm proposals and practical numerical simulations, offering insights into the feasibility and performance of quantum annealing in structured problem domains.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Abstract:** This study explores the use of tensor networks to simulate quantum annealing algorithms for optimization problems with specific structural properties, such as locality and symmetry. By focusing on structured problems, the research leverages tensor networks' strengths in representing low-entanglement quantum states while addressing scalability challenges. Advanced techniques like time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) are employed to simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum annealing. Validation is performed on small-scale problems with known solutions, providing a foundation for scaling up to more complex cases. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum algorithm proposals and practical numerical simulations, offering insights into the feasibility and performance of quantum annealing in structured problem domains.\n",
