    """Base actor class for agent-based models in ABSESpy.

    An Actor represents an autonomous agent in a social-ecological system. It combines
    geospatial capabilities (from mesa-geo), network functionality (links), and
    ABSESpy-specific features like perception and movement. Actors can be located
    on spatial cells, form networks with other actors, and interact with their
    environment through perceptions and actions.

    Actors maintain their own state including position, alive status, age, and custom
    attributes. They can move between cells, perceive their environment, form links
    with other actors, and execute custom behaviors through overridable methods.

    The Actor class serves as a base class for creating custom agent types. Users
    should inherit from Actor and override methods like `setup()` and `initialize()`
    to define agent-specific behaviors.

    Attributes:
        breed: The breed (type) of this actor, defaults to class name.
        layer: The spatial layer where the actor is located.
        indices: The grid indices of the cell where the actor is located.
        pos: The position of the cell where the actor is located.
        on_earth: Whether the actor is positioned on a spatial cell.
        at: The specific cell where the actor is located.
        link: Proxy for managing network links with other actors.
        move: Proxy for manipulating actor's spatial location.
        geometry: The shapely geometry representing the actor's spatial form.
        alive: Whether the actor is alive (not removed from the model).
        unique_id: Unique identifier automatically assigned by Mesa.
        crs: Coordinate reference system for the actor's geometry.

    Example:
        ```python
        class Farmer(Actor):
            def setup(self):
                self.wealth = 100
