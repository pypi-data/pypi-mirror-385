# Case Study 1 - Define (Part 1): PowerPoint MCP

## Problem Statement

PowerPoint presentations remain central to business and academic work, yet professionals face a critical automation gap. **The problem:** PowerPoint operates as a manual tool while AI assistants like Claude can generate content but cannot interact with PowerPoint files, forcing manual workflows. Updating 50 slides with quarterly data consumes hours, while valuable data remains trapped in charts with no extraction capability. **Who's affected:** Business analysts creating client presentations, educators formatting equations, data scientists extracting historical data, and training teams maintaining material libraries. **Where:** Reporting workflows (monthly reviews), client deliverables, educational content, and data pipelines where BI outputs need presentation format. **When:** Daily (sales customizing decks), weekly (marketing updates), quarterly (finance board presentations), and crisis moments—"10 customized versions by tomorrow." **Why:** PowerPoint's manual design philosophy plus skills gap (professionals lack programming, developers rarely do PowerPoint automation) creates fragmentation between data tools and presentations.

**Current approaches:** Manual creation doesn't scale. VBA macros are outdated and complex. Python-pptx library (https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/) enables generation but is write-only—cannot read existing presentations. Recent Office-PowerPoint-MCP-Server (GongRzhe, 2024, https://github.com/GongRzhe/Office-PowerPoint-MCP-Server) wraps python-pptx with 34 tools but inherits write-only limits, preventing data extraction. Anthropic's file creation (Anthropic, 2024, https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files) enables conversational generation but uses one-shot code regeneration rather than incremental tool-based modifications.

**Our solution:** PowerPoint MCP uses COM automation for bidirectional access—reading AND writing with full PowerPoint features. Our `slide_snapshot` extracts chart data, tables, and metadata. Unlike one-shot generation, discrete MCP tools enable incremental modifications with persistent context across conversational interactions.

**Problem Statement:** Existing PowerPoint automation lacks bidirectional capabilities and conversational granularity. Professionals waste 5-10 hours weekly on repetitive tasks while data remains inaccessible. We need an AI-native bridge enabling persistent, conversational manipulation through granular tools with full COM access.

## Storyboard

**Why:** The "last mile problem"—sophisticated data pipelines exist, but presentation assembly remains manual. **Who:** Analysts, educators, data scientists, training teams. **What:** Claude performs tool-based operations: (1) Reading—extract text, charts, tables via `slide_snapshot`, (2) Writing—populate LaTeX equations, matplotlib plots, HTML formatting, (3) Automation—batch operations via `powerpoint_evaluate`, (4) Management—file operations and navigation. **How:** Natural language conversation. Example: "Update revenue charts in 5 presentations with Q4 CSV data." Claude inspects structure, opens presentations, locates charts, applies data, verifies—maintaining context throughout. Key differentiators: persistent context, granular control, bidirectional verification, conversational error recovery.

**Visualizations:** Three 6-panel comic storyboards illustrate journeys: (1) Analyst updating 5 presentations in 47 minutes vs. 4 hours, (2) Professor generating LaTeX equations instantly vs. 30-minute struggles, (3) Scientist extracting 60 presentations in 3 hours vs. 2-week manual work.

## Usage Discrepancies

**Expected:** Legitimate automation with AI as assistant, humans maintaining oversight. **Actual Risks:**

**Security:** `powerpoint_evaluate` executes Python/COM code, risking malicious execution or data exfiltration. **Mitigation:** Sandboxing (block os, subprocess, socket), allowlist safe modules, user approval, audit logging. *(Privacy and Security)*

**Over-Reliance:** Users distributing unverified AI content, accepting hallucinated data, losing manual skills. **Mitigation:** Preview mechanisms, verification prompts, human-in-the-loop approval. *(Human Safety)*

**Misinformation:** WebSearch + professional formatting scales fabricated statistics. **Mitigation:** Source attribution, hallucination warnings, watermarking. *(Societal Risks)*

**Legal:** Automation violating IP, GDPR, or bypassing approvals. **Mitigation:** DLP integration, access controls, audit trails, clear terms. *(Legal and Governance Risks)*

**Financial:** Data corruption, unexpected costs, erroneous business outputs. **Mitigation:** Automated backups, cost monitoring, validation checks. *(Financial Risks)*

**Sustainability:** Inefficient code consuming excessive resources. **Mitigation:** Resource limits, caching, rate limiting. *(Sustainability)*

**Design Implications:** Powerful automation requires layered safeguards—sandboxing (technical), user consent (procedural), audit logging (accountability), role-based access (organizational). Operations must be transparent, reversible, and verifiable.

## Always-On Topics

All seven topics continuously inform design: **Privacy and Security** (sandboxing, local processing), **Human Safety** (preview mechanisms, preserving agency), **Societal Risks** (misinformation prevention, attribution), **Legal** (GDPR compliance, DLP), **Financial** (backups, validation), **Governance** (workflows, audit trails), **Sustainability** (resource limits, efficiency). These are interconnected design constraints ensuring responsible automation deployment.
