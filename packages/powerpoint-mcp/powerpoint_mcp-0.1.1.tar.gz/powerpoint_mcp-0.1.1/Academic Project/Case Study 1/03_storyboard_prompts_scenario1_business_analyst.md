## Panel 1: The Overwhelming Problem
**Visual Description:**
A stressed Asian woman in a navy blue blazer and white blouse sits at a sleek modern desk surrounded by THREE large computer monitors displaying PowerPoint presentations. The clock on the wall shows 9:47 PM (nighttime). Her desk is cluttered with coffee cups (at least two), sticky notes, and printed presentation slides scattered everywhere. On the monitors, we can see multiple PowerPoint windows open showing similar-looking quarterly business review slides with charts and graphs. Her hands are on her head in a gesture of frustration. The office behind her is dark—she's the only one still working, with other empty cubicles visible in the background. A prominent speech bubble from her says "FIVE client presentations due tomorrow... and the Q4 data just changed AGAIN!" The lighting is dramatic—her face illuminated by the blue glow of the monitors, creating shadows that emphasize her stress. Small visual details: an energy drink can, a half-eaten sandwich, her jacket draped over the chair, and a family photo on the desk she hasn't looked at in hours.

**Mood:** Overwhelming stress, time pressure, repetitive manual labor
**Key Elements:** Multiple monitors, PowerPoint screenshots visible, nighttime office, exhausted professional

## Panel 2: Discovery of the Solution
**Visual Description:**
The same woman is now leaning back in her chair, looking at her laptop screen with an expression of curiosity and hope. The laptop screen is clearly visible showing a web browser with the Anthropic Claude website featuring the headline "PowerPoint MCP: AI-Powered Presentation Automation." Her posture has changed from stressed to intrigued—one hand on her chin in a thinking pose, the other holding a mouse. On the screen, we can see bullet points mentioning "Bidirectional PowerPoint Control," "Batch Operations," and "Natural Language Commands." A small inset panel shows a close-up of her eyes widening with interest, reflecting the blue light of the screen. In the background, through the office window, we can see it's still dark outside but there are a few stars visible. A thought bubble above her head reads "Wait... AI can actually UPDATE my existing presentations?" The coffee cup near her is still steaming, suggesting renewed energy. The sticky notes on her monitor include one that says "Ask about automation tools" (suggesting a colleague recommendation).

**Mood:** Hope, curiosity, discovery moment, possibility
**Key Elements:** Computer screen with Claude/MCP information, woman's expression changing from stress to interest, visible webpage details

## Panel 3: Installation and Setup
**Visual Description:**
A close-up split panel showing both the woman's face (left side) and her computer terminal window (right side, taking up 60% of the panel). Her expression shows focused concentration with a slight smile—the stress is lifting. The terminal window displays in clear, readable text: `claude mcp add powerpoint npx @ayushmaniar/powerpoint-mcp@latest` with green success checkmarks and installation progress bars showing "Installing dependencies... ✓ Complete." Below the command, we see output text: "PowerPoint MCP Server initialized successfully" with a green checkmark icon. Her hand is visible at the bottom of the frame, fingers poised over a sleek wireless keyboard with RGB backlighting. In the background (slightly blurred), we can see one of her monitors still showing the old PowerPoint with the Q4 revenue chart that needs updating. The time is now 10:15 PM—only 28 minutes have passed. Small detail: a sticky note on her monitor edge that says "npx command" in her handwriting.

**Mood:** Technical competence, ease of setup, "this is actually happening" realization
**Key Elements:** Terminal window with clear command text, professional woman engaging with technology, contrast between old problem (PowerPoint in background) and new solution

## Panel 4: Natural Language Interaction with Claude
**Visual Description:**
The main focus is a large chat window (Claude AI interface) taking up the center of the image, with the woman visible from behind/side angle, hands typing on the keyboard. The chat conversation is clearly readable:

**Sarah (her message):** "I have 5 client presentations in the 'Q4_Reports' folder. Each has a slide titled 'Revenue Projections.' I need to update ALL the revenue charts with new data from Q4_Final_Data.csv. The first column has client names, second column has updated revenue values. Can you do this?"

**Claude (response with PowerPoint MCP icon):** "Absolutely! I'll use PowerPoint MCP to systematically update all 5 presentations. Let me:
1. Open each presentation
2. Find the Revenue Projections slide
3. Update the chart with matching data from your CSV
I'll work through them one by one and confirm each update."

Below the chat, we see a small activity indicator showing "PowerPoint MCP Server: Processing presentation 1 of 5..." with a progress bar at 20%. The woman's posture shows leaning forward with interest—she's engaged and hopeful. In the reflection of her glasses (visible in profile), we can see tiny PowerPoint slide thumbnails. The lighting has gotten warmer—a desk lamp is now on, creating a more comfortable working environment. Time shown: 10:23 PM.

**Mood:** Conversational ease, AI understanding complex request, professional collaboration between human and AI
**Key Elements:** Chat interface with detailed readable text, woman observing the interaction, progress indicator showing actual work happening

## Panel 5: The MCP Server at Work (Behind the Scenes)
**Visual Description:**
A stylized "cutaway" technical visualization showing what's happening behind the scenes. The top half shows the woman's monitor displaying PowerPoint with a presentation open—specifically a slide with the title "Revenue Projections - Acme Corp Q4" and a bar chart. Overlaid on the presentation are glowing blue "connection lines" and floating icons representing the MCP tools in action:

- A magnifying glass icon labeled "slide_snapshot" examining the chart
- A wrench icon labeled "populate_placeholder" hovering over the chart data
- A database icon showing the CSV file feeding data to the chart
- Arrows showing data flow from CSV → Claude → PowerPoint

The bottom half shows a simplified architectural diagram: the woman's computer with three connected components: "Claude AI" (brain icon), "MCP Server" (glowing server icon), and "PowerPoint COM" (PowerPoint logo). Bidirectional arrows labeled "Read" and "Write" connect them. Small code snippets float in the background (partially visible): "chart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = ..." and "slide_number=5, content_type='chart'..." The overall style is like a tech infographic—clean, modern, with glowing neon blue and purple accents against a dark background. A timer in the corner shows "2 min 14 sec elapsed" emphasizing the speed.

**Mood:** Technical sophistication, automation in action, "this is the magic happening" visualization
**Key Elements:** MCP architecture visualization, PowerPoint slide being modified, data flow arrows, technical but accessible representation

## Panel 6: Success and Resolution
**Visual Description:**
A bright, triumphant final panel split into two parts. The top portion (larger, 70%) shows the woman standing and stretching with both arms raised in victory, a genuine smile of relief on her face. The clock now shows 10:35 PM—only 47 minutes since she discovered PowerPoint MCP, and ALL five presentations are complete. Her three monitors display the SUCCESS state:

- **Monitor 1:** PowerPoint showing "Revenue Projections - Acme Corp" with updated chart, a green checkmark overlay
- **Monitor 2:** PowerPoint showing "Revenue Projections - GlobalTech Inc" with updated chart, green checkmark
- **Monitor 3:** Chat window with Claude's final message: "✓ All 5 presentations updated successfully! Revenue charts synchronized with Q4_Final_Data.csv. All files saved. Ready for tomorrow's client meetings."

The bottom portion (30%) shows a "before and after" comparison with small arrows:
- **BEFORE:** Stressed woman with multiple coffee cups, "Hours of manual work" text, clock showing late night
- **AFTER:** Smiling woman, clean desk, "47 minutes with PowerPoint MCP" text, time to go home

The office lighting is now normal—she's turned off the harsh desk lamp. She's packing her bag, and we can see she's picking up the family photo to put in her bag. Through the window, we see the night sky but it's not as desperately late. A speech bubble from her: "Tomorrow I'm recommending this to the entire team!" The overall color palette has shifted from the cold blue stress lighting to warm, satisfied orange/yellow tones.

**Mood:** Victory, relief, work-life balance restored, successful automation outcome
**Key Elements:** Visible success metrics (all 5 done), time saved emphasized, before/after contrast, human benefit highlighted (can go home at reasonable hour)
