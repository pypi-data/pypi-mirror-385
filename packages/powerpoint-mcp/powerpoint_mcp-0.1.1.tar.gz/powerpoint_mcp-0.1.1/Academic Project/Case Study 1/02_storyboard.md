# Storyboard: User Journey and System Interaction

## Storyboard Framework

The PowerPoint MCP solution addresses user needs through a structured interaction model that transforms presentation workflows from manual labor to AI-assisted automation. Our storyboard framework examines four critical dimensions: the underlying problem motivation (Why), the affected stakeholders (Who), the system's capabilities (What), and the interaction mechanics (How).

## Why: The Problem Statement Driving the Solution

The fundamental driver behind PowerPoint MCP is the productivity crisis created by PowerPoint's manual-centric design in an automated world. As established in our problem statement, professionals across business, academia, and data science waste 5-10 hours weekly on repetitive presentation tasks while valuable data remains trapped and inaccessible within slide decks. The "last mile problem" persists: organizations have sophisticated data pipelines and AI capabilities, yet the final presentation deliverable requires manual assembly, breaking the automation chain. This inefficiency compounds when professionals face crisis scenarios—"create 10 personalized decks by tomorrow morning"—where manual workflows cannot possibly scale to meet urgent demands. The problem is not merely about time waste; it represents a fundamental capability gap where AI assistants that excel at content generation cannot interact with one of business's most ubiquitous document formats.

## Who: Stakeholder Ecosystem

The stakeholder landscape for PowerPoint MCP spans multiple professional domains, each with distinct needs and pain points:

**Business Analysts and Consultants** serve as primary stakeholders, creating dozens of client presentations monthly. They face the recurring challenge of updating template-based reports with new data—quarterly business reviews with 30-50 slides requiring data refreshes, or personalized investor decks for 20 different clients with customized financial projections. Their workflow bottleneck occurs at the intersection of data analysis and presentation assembly.

**Educators and Academic Researchers** represent a critical stakeholder group requiring specialized content capabilities. Math and science professors spend excessive time formatting equations using PowerPoint's equation editor, creating inconsistent results across lecture slides. They need to generate course materials with professional LaTeX rendering, maintain consistency across semesters, and extract data from research presentations for meta-analysis. Their pain point centers on the gap between scientific notation tools and presentation software.

**Data Scientists and Analysts** encounter PowerPoint from two directions: generating automated report presentations from analytical pipelines, and extracting historical data from presentation archives for systematic analysis. They need bidirectional interaction—both writing new presentations with data visualizations and reading existing slides to mine chart values and table data. Their workflow requires programmatic access that current tools don't provide.

**Corporate Training Teams** manage large presentation libraries requiring consistent updates. When branding changes or content policies evolve, they face updating hundreds of slides manually. They need bulk operations with preview capabilities and consistent formatting enforcement across diverse materials.

**Secondary stakeholders** include IT administrators concerned with security and governance, compliance officers monitoring data handling, and executives who consume presentation outputs and care about accuracy and turnaround time.

## What: AI Capabilities and System Functions

PowerPoint MCP enables AI assistants (specifically Claude, but architecturally extensible to any MCP-compatible AI) to perform granular, tool-based operations on PowerPoint presentations through a persistent conversational interface.

**Reading and Analysis Capabilities:** The system can extract comprehensive slide content—text with HTML formatting preservation, chart data series with numerical values and axis labels, table contents in markdown format with hyperlinks, comments with author metadata and timestamps, and speaker notes. This enables data mining workflows previously impossible: extracting all revenue charts from historical presentations, analyzing table structures across presentation archives, or auditing presentation content for compliance.

**Writing and Creation Capabilities:** The AI can populate placeholders with diverse content types: plain text, HTML-formatted text with styling (bold, italic, colors, lists), LaTeX equations rendered professionally, matplotlib plots generated from Python code, and images with automatic aspect-ratio preservation. This enables automated generation of scientific presentations with equations, data-driven reports with visualizations, and template-based client deliverables with personalized content.

**Automation Capabilities:** Through the evaluate tool, the system executes Python code with PowerPoint COM access, enabling batch operations across slides, geometric calculations for complex layouts, and multi-step workflows combining multiple tools. This allows operations like "update all charts across 5 presentations," "generate 20 personalized decks from CSV data," or "create circular organizational chart with calculated positions."

**File Management Capabilities:** The AI can open, close, create, save, and navigate presentations, switch between slides, duplicate or delete slides, and manage multiple presentations simultaneously.

Critically, these capabilities operate through **discrete, composable tools** rather than monolithic code generation. The AI can inspect a slide, decide which element to modify, execute a targeted operation, verify the result, and iterate—all within a natural conversation maintaining context across interactions.

## How: User Interaction and Workflow

The interaction model fundamentally differs from both traditional scripting and one-shot code generation approaches. Users interact with PowerPoint MCP through natural language conversation with Claude, which orchestrates the appropriate MCP tools behind the scenes.

**Installation and Setup:** Users install PowerPoint MCP via a single command: `claude mcp add powerpoint npx @ayushmaniar/powerpoint-mcp@latest`. The hybrid npm+Python architecture automatically detects the appropriate Python environment (uv, python3, or python) and establishes the MCP server connection. No programming knowledge required—the complexity is abstracted behind the simple installation command.

**Conversational Workflow Pattern:** A typical interaction follows this pattern:

1. **Context Establishment:** User describes their goal in natural language: "I need to update the revenue charts in my Q4 presentation with new data from this CSV file."

2. **AI Analysis:** Claude uses the `slide_snapshot` tool to inspect existing presentation content, understanding current chart structure, data format, and slide layout.

3. **Incremental Execution:** Rather than generating complete code in one shot, Claude executes discrete operations: open the presentation, switch to the relevant slide, extract current chart data, read the CSV file, update the chart with new values, verify the update succeeded.

4. **Interactive Refinement:** User provides feedback: "The chart looks good, but can you change the colors to our corporate blue scheme?" Claude adjusts, maintaining context from previous operations.

5. **Verification and Iteration:** User can ask "Show me what's on slide 5 now" and Claude uses `slide_snapshot` to provide current state, enabling verification before moving forward.

**Use Case Examples:**

*Business Analyst:* "Claude, I have 5 client presentations in this folder. Update all the revenue projection charts with data from Q4_data.csv, using each client's name from the filename." Claude iterates through files, reads each presentation, locates revenue charts, applies appropriate data mappings, and confirms completion.

*Math Professor:* "Claude, create a slide explaining the quadratic formula, including the equation, its derivation, and a graph showing a parabola." Claude uses `populate_placeholder` with LaTeX for the equation, generates matplotlib code for the graph, and formats text with HTML styling—all composed conversationally.

*Data Scientist:* "Claude, extract all chart data from slides 10-25 in these 3 research presentations and save to a CSV file for analysis." Claude systematically reads slides, extracts numerical data series, structures it into tabular format, and exports—enabling meta-analysis of previously inaccessible presentation data.

**Key Interaction Differentiators:**

- **Persistent Context:** Unlike one-shot generation, the conversation maintains state. Claude remembers what slides were examined, what operations were performed, and can refer back to previous steps.

- **Granular Control:** Operations happen at tool level (snapshot this slide, populate that placeholder) rather than "write all the code to do everything." This enables targeted modifications without regenerating entire presentations.

- **Bidirectional Verification:** Claude can read back what was written, verify operations succeeded, and catch errors through inspection—impossible with write-only tools.

- **Natural Error Recovery:** If an operation fails, Claude can diagnose (by inspecting the presentation state), adjust the approach, and retry—conversational debugging rather than script rewriting.

This interaction model transforms PowerPoint from a manual application into a programmable substrate accessible through natural language, while maintaining the conversational flexibility and error correction that makes AI assistance powerful.
