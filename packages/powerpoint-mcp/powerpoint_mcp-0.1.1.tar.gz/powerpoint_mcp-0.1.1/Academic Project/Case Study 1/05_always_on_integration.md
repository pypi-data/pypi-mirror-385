# Integration of Always-On Topics

Throughout our case study development, we have continuously considered the seven "always-on" topics that must remain in every data scientist's mind when creating AI solutions. These topics are not afterthoughts but integral considerations that shape our design decisions, usage expectations, and risk mitigation strategies.

## Always-On Topics in PowerPoint MCP Design

**Privacy and Security:** The `powerpoint_evaluate` tool presents our most significant security challenge—arbitrary code execution in the user's local environment. We've identified sandboxing (blocking dangerous libraries like `os`, `subprocess`, `socket`) as Priority 1, coupled with user consent mechanisms, audit logging, and allowlist-based library access. All processing remains local via COM automation, avoiding cloud data exposure, but we must respect file permissions and prevent unauthorized access to system resources beyond PowerPoint's scope.

**Human Safety:** Our usage discrepancy analysis highlights over-reliance risks where users might distribute AI-generated content without adequate verification, potentially leading to errors in high-stakes presentations. We emphasize preview mechanisms, human-in-the-loop approval for destructive operations, and maintaining user agency through transparent, reversible operations. The goal is augmentation, not replacement—eliminating drudgery while preserving critical thinking.

**Societal Risks:** The combination of PowerPoint MCP with LLM WebSearch capabilities could enable misinformation at scale—fabricated statistics visualized professionally, hallucinated data in authoritative-looking charts. We've identified source attribution, hallucination warnings, fact-check prompts, and AI-generated content watermarking as essential mitigations. The professional appearance our tools enable must not lend false credibility to inaccurate content.

**Legal Risks:** Automation could inadvertently violate intellectual property (automated image insertion without license verification), data protection regulations (processing GDPR-protected personal data in presentations), or organizational governance (bypassing approval workflows). We must integrate with DLP systems, respect access controls, implement audit trails for compliance, and clearly define user responsibilities through terms of service.

**Financial Risks:** While PowerPoint MCP aims to reduce costs through productivity gains, we've identified financial risks from data corruption (destroying valuable presentation assets), unexpected API costs (excessive LLM calls), and erroneous outputs causing business damage (incorrect financial projections in investor decks). Automated backups, cost monitoring, validation checks for numerical data, and graceful degradation (failing safely without corruption) address these risks.

**Governance and Political Risks:** The evaluate tool's power to execute Python code could bypass organizational policies if not properly governed. Audit logging for all operations, integration with organizational approval workflows, centralized template management for brand compliance, and respect for Active Directory permissions ensure the tool operates within governance frameworks rather than circumventing them.

**Sustainability:** Inefficient automation could waste computational resources—poorly optimized evaluate tool code, redundant LLM API calls, runaway operations processing thousands of files. We've emphasized efficient operations through caching, resource limits (timeouts, memory caps), rate limiting for bulk operations, and code quality standards. The ease of natural language commands must not obscure the computational cost and energy footprint of operations.

## Continuous Consideration

These always-on topics are not isolated concerns but interconnected considerations that inform every design decision. Security sandboxing protects both privacy and governance. Human-in-the-loop workflows address both safety and societal risks. Audit logging serves legal, financial, and governance needs. Our development approach treats these topics as continuous constraints rather than post-hoc additions, ensuring responsible deployment of powerful automation capabilities.
