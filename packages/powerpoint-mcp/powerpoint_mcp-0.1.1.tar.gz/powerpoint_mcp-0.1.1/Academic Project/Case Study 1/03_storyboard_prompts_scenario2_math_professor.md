## Panel 1: The Equation Editor Struggle
**Visual Description:**
A middle-aged Hispanic man with salt-and-pepper hair and glasses sits hunched over his laptop in a cluttered university office. The office has floor-to-ceiling bookshelves packed with mathematics textbooks, a whiteboard in the background filled with partial equations, and a "Professor Rodriguez - Office Hours: MWF 2-4pm" nameplate on the desk. His laptop screen prominently shows Microsoft PowerPoint's equation editor interface—the old, clunky dropdown menus with tiny buttons for mathematical symbols. On the slide being edited, we see a partially completed quadratic formula that looks WRONG: the fraction bar is misaligned, the square root symbol is too small, and the ± symbol is in the wrong font. The professor's expression shows intense frustration—eyebrows furrowed, lips pursed, one hand gesturing at the screen in exasperation, the other clicking the mouse repeatedly. The clock on the wall shows 4:45 PM. On his desk: a printed textbook open to "Calculus II - Lecture 7: Integration by Parts," sticky notes with equation fragments, a "World's Best Prof" mug (ironic given his current mood), and a stack of unchecked student assignments. A thought bubble above his head: "Why does this NEVER look like it does in LaTeX?!"

**Mood:** Frustration with inadequate tools, tedious technical formatting work distracting from teaching content
**Key Elements:** PowerPoint equation editor visible and problematic, academic office setting, mathematics textbooks, misaligned equation on screen

## Panel 2: Colleague's Recommendation
**Visual Description:**
The scene shifts to the university hallway outside the mathematics department. Two professors are walking together—Dr. Rodriguez (our protagonist) on the left with his laptop bag over his shoulder, looking tired, and a younger female colleague, Dr. Patel (South Asian, wearing a blazer and jeans, energetic expression) on the right, gesturing animatedly as she talks. The hallway has typical academic features: bulletin boards with seminar announcements, student posters about math club, a water fountain, and numbered office doors. Dr. Patel is pointing to her smartphone screen, which shows a glimpse of a chat interface with Claude. Her speech bubble: "Marcus, you HAVE to try PowerPoint MCP with Claude! I generated my entire Linear Algebra lecture deck with perfect LaTeX equations in 20 minutes. No more equation editor torture!" Dr. Rodriguez's expression shows skeptical interest—one eyebrow raised, slight smile, but still looking doubtful. His speech bubble: "LaTeX? In PowerPoint? That actually works?" In the background, through a classroom window, we can see students waiting for the next class. Dr. Patel's laptop bag has a sticker that says "I ❤️ LaTeX."

**Mood:** Peer recommendation, academic collegiality, introduction of solution through trusted source
**Key Elements:** Two professors in conversation, smartphone showing Claude interface, academic hallway setting, skeptical but interested expression

## Panel 3: Setup and First Attempt
**Visual Description:**
Back in Dr. Rodriguez's office, now with warmer evening lighting (desk lamp on, window showing dusky sky). The professor sits at his desk with his laptop open, but his posture is more upright and engaged than Panel 1. His laptop screen is split into two windows: on the left, a terminal window showing the installation command `claude mcp add powerpoint npx @ayushmaniar/powerpoint-mcp@latest` with a green checkmark and "✓ Installation complete"; on the right, PowerPoint is open with a BLANK slide titled "Lecture 7: Integration by Parts." The professor is leaning forward, hands poised over the keyboard, with an expression of careful focus—he's trying something new and being deliberate about it. On the desk, his "World's Best Prof" mug is now full and steaming (fresh coffee for this new experiment). The textbook is still open next to him, but now he's also opened a notebook where he's handwritten LaTeX code: `\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du`. A small sticky note on his monitor reads "Ask for quadratic formula first - test case." The whiteboard behind him now shows a rough outline: "1. Quadratic Formula, 2. Completing the Square, 3. Application Examples."

**Mood:** Cautious optimism, learning something new, organized academic approaching technology methodically
**Key Elements:** Split screen showing terminal and PowerPoint, handwritten LaTeX notes, professor's deliberate/focused posture, academic workspace

## Panel 4: Natural Language Request for LaTeX
**Visual Description:**
A large, centered chat interface (Claude AI) dominates the panel, with Dr. Rodriguez visible in the bottom right corner from a three-quarter angle, typing with both hands on the keyboard. The chat conversation is crystal clear and occupies 70% of the panel:

**Dr. Rodriguez (his message):** "I'm creating a calculus lecture. Can you create a slide with the title 'The Quadratic Formula' and include the equation in proper mathematical notation? The formula is: x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all over 2a. Also add below it: 'Used to solve equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0'"

**Claude (response with PowerPoint MCP indicator):** "Absolutely! I'll create a professionally formatted slide with LaTeX rendering. The quadratic formula will be typeset beautifully:

Title: The Quadratic Formula

\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]

And I'll add the explanatory text below. Working on it now..."

Below the chat, a small status indicator shows: "PowerPoint MCP: Rendering LaTeX equation..." with a progress spinner. The professor's face shows amazement—eyes wide, mouth slightly open, glasses reflecting the screen light. His hand has paused mid-typing. A thought bubble: "It understood my natural language description of the formula!" The textbook on his desk is now closed—he doesn't need to reference the exact LaTeX syntax. The time is 5:12 PM.

**Mood:** Amazement at AI understanding, natural language bridging the gap between mathematical intention and technical implementation
**Key Elements:** Detailed chat transcript with natural language math description, Claude's LaTeX response visible, professor's surprised expression

## Panel 5: The Perfect Result
**Visual Description:**
A triumphant reveal panel showing Dr. Rodriguez's laptop screen at full size (90% of panel), with the professor's hands visible at the bottom edge of the frame (fingers raised in a "perfect!" gesture, thumb and forefinger touching in OK sign). The PowerPoint slide on screen is BEAUTIFUL and professional:

**Slide Title:** "The Quadratic Formula" (centered, professional font, dark blue text)

**Main Content:** A perfectly rendered LaTeX equation centered on the slide:
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
[The equation should be rendered in actual mathematical typesetting—not typed text, but proper fraction bar, square root symbol extending perfectly over the expression, ± symbol perfectly aligned, subscripts and superscripts properly sized]

**Below the equation:** Clean, formatted text: "Used to solve equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0"

The slide has subtle professional styling—a light gradient background, the university logo in the corner, and slide number "7" at the bottom. A green "✓ Successfully created" notification appears in the top-right corner of the screen. In the corner of the panel, we see a "BEFORE/AFTER" comparison in small inset images:
- BEFORE: The mangled equation from Panel 1 with misaligned symbols
- AFTER: This perfect LaTeX rendering

The professor's facial expression (visible in a small circular inset at the bottom right) shows pure joy and relief—a genuine smile, eyes crinkled. Time stamp: 5:14 PM (only 2 minutes from request to completion).

**Mood:** Perfection, professional result, dramatic before/after contrast, relief and satisfaction
**Key Elements:** Full-screen beautiful LaTeX equation in PowerPoint, clear before/after comparison, university branding, timestamp showing speed

## Panel 6: Teaching Success
**Visual Description:**
The final panel shifts to a CLASSROOM setting the next day, showing the payoff of the technology. Wide angle view of a university lecture hall with tiered seating. Dr. Rodriguez stands at the front near a large projection screen, holding a wireless presentation clicker, mid-lecture. The projection screen shows the beautiful quadratic formula slide from Panel 5, crisp and clear even at large scale. The professor's posture is confident and animated—one arm gesturing toward the equation, the other holding the clicker, face showing engagement and enthusiasm. The classroom is about 60% full with diverse college students (various ethnicities, ages 18-22) sitting at curved desks with laptops and notebooks. Several students are actively engaged:
- Front row: A student photographing the slide with her phone (it actually looks good enough to capture!)
- Middle row: A student nodding while taking notes, writing the equation in his notebook
- Back row: Two students leaning in to discuss the formula

Speech bubbles show engagement:
- Dr. Rodriguez: "Notice how elegant this formula is—it encodes all the information about parabolic solutions!"
- Student in front: "This is so much clearer than the textbook version!"

In the bottom right corner, a small "THREE WEEKS LATER" caption with a montage of additional slides: "Integration by Parts," "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus," "Taylor Series"—all showing perfect LaTeX equations, indicating he's now using PowerPoint MCP for all his lectures. The classroom windows show daylight, and there's a "Math 152 - Dr. Rodriguez" label on the door frame. The professor's "World's Best Prof" mug sits on the desk at the front of the classroom.

**Mood:** Success in actual teaching context, student engagement, technology enabling better education, full-circle resolution
**Key Elements:** Classroom setting with students, projected slide visible and impressive, professor actively teaching, student engagement indicators, time-jump showing continued use
