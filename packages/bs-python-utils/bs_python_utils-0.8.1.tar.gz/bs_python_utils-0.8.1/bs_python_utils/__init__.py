  $X \\simeq N(0,1)$
* `chebyshev` has Chebyshev interpolation and integration in dimensions 1 and 2
* `distance_covariances` has measures of nonlinear dependence between random variables
* `bivariate_quantiles` computes quantiles and ranks for 2-dimensional random
  variables Ã  la [Chernozhukov-Galichon-Hallin-Henry (*Ann. Stats.* 2017)](
