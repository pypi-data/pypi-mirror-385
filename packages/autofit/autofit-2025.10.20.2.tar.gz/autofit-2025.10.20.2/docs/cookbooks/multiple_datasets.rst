Multiple Datasets
=================

This cookbook illustrates how to fit multiple datasets simultaneously, where each dataset is fitted by a different
``Analysis`` class.

The ``Analysis`` classes are combined to give an overall log likelihood function that is the sum of the
individual log likelihood functions, which a single model is fitted to via non-linear search.

If one has multiple observations of the same signal, it is often desirable to fit them simultaneously. This ensures
that better constraints are placed on the model, as the full amount of information in the datasets is used.

In some scenarios, the signal may vary across the datasets in a way that requires that the model is updated
accordingly. **PyAutoFit** provides tools to customize the model composition such that specific parameters of the model
vary across the datasets.

This cookbook illustrates using observations of 3 1D Gaussians, which have the same ``centre`` (which is the same
for the model fitted to each dataset) but different ``normalization`` and ``sigma`` values (which vary for the model
fitted to each dataset).

It is common for each individual dataset to only constrain specific aspects of a model. The high level of model
customization provided by **PyAutoFit** ensures that composing a model that is appropriate for fitting large and diverse
datasets is straight forward. This is because different ``Analysis`` classes can be written for each dataset and combined.

**Contents:**

- **Model-Fit**: Setup a model-fit to 3 datasets to illustrate multi-dataset fitting.
- **Analysis List**: Create a list of ``Analysis`` objects, one for each dataset, which are fitted simultaneously.
- **Analysis Factor**: Wrap each ``Analysis`` object in an ``AnalysisFactor``, which pairs it with the model and prepares it for model fitting.
- **Factor Graph**: Combine all ``AnalysisFactor`` objects into a ``FactorGraphModel``, which represents a global model fit to multiple datasets.
- **Result List**: Use the output of fits to multiple datasets which are a list of ``Result`` objects.
- **Variable Model Across Datasets**: Fit a model where certain parameters vary across the datasets whereas others stay fixed.
- **Relational Model**: Fit models where certain parameters vary across the dataset as a user defined relation (e.g. ``y = mx + c``).
- **Different Analysis Classes**: Fit multiple datasets where each dataset is fitted by a different ``Analysis`` class, meaning that datasets with different formats can be fitted simultaneously.
- **Interpolation**: Fit multiple datasets with a model one-by-one and interpolation over a smoothly varying parameter (e.g. time) to infer the model between datasets.
- **Individual Sequential Searches**: Fit multiple datasets where each dataset is fitted one-by-one sequentially.
- **Hierarchical / Graphical Models**: Use hierarchical / graphical models to fit multiple datasets simultaneously, which fit for global trends in the model across the datasets.

Model Fit
---------

Load 3 1D Gaussian datasets from .json files in the directory ``autofit_workspace/dataset/``.

All three datasets contain an identical signal, therefore fitting the same model to all three datasets simultaneously
is appropriate.

Each dataset has a different noise realization, therefore fitting them simultaneously will offer improved constraints 
over individual fits.

.. code-block:: python

    dataset_size = 3

    data_list = []
    noise_map_list = []

    for dataset_index in range(dataset_size):
        dataset_path = path.join(
            "dataset", "example_1d", f"gaussian_x1_identical_{dataset_index}"
        )

        data = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.json"))
        data_list.append(data)

        noise_map = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(
            file_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.json")
        )
        noise_map_list.append(noise_map)

Plot all 3 datasets, including their error bars. 

.. code-block:: python

    for data, noise_map in zip(data_list, noise_map_list):
        xvalues = range(data.shape[0])

        plt.errorbar(
            x=xvalues,
            y=data,
            yerr=noise_map,
            color="k",
            ecolor="k",
            linestyle=" ",
            elinewidth=1,
            capsize=2,
        )
        plt.show()
        plt.close()

Here is what the plots look like:

Create our model corresponding to a single 1D Gaussian that is fitted to all 3 datasets simultaneously.

.. code-block:: python

    model = af.Model(af.ex.Gaussian)

    model.centre = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=100.0)
    model.normalization = af.LogUniformPrior(lower_limit=1e-2, upper_limit=1e2)
    model.sigma = af.GaussianPrior(
        mean=10.0, sigma=5.0, lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=np.inf
    )

Analysis List
-------------

Set up three instances of the ``Analysis`` class which fit 1D Gaussian.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis_list = []

    for data, noise_map in zip(data_list, noise_map_list):

        analysis = af.ex.Analysis(data=data, noise_map=noise_map)
        analysis_list.append(analysis)

Analysis Factor
---------------

Each analysis object is wrapped in an ``AnalysisFactor``, which pairs it with the model and prepares it for use in a 
factor graph. This step allows us to flexibly define how each dataset relates to the model.

The term "Factor" comes from factor graphs, a type of probabilistic graphical model. In this context, each factor 
represents the connection between one dataset and the shared model.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis_factor_list = []
    
    for analysis in analysis_list:
    
        analysis_factor = af.AnalysisFactor(prior_model=model, analysis=analysis)
    
        analysis_factor_list.append(analysis_factor)

Factor Graph
------------

All ``AnalysisFactor`` objects are combined into a ``FactorGraphModel``, which represents a global model fit to 
multiple datasets using a graphical model structure.

The key outcomes of this setup are:

 - The individual log likelihoods from each ``Analysis`` object are summed to form the total log likelihood 
   evaluated during the model-fitting process.
   
 - Results from all datasets are output to a unified directory, with subdirectories for visualizations 
   from each analysis object, as defined by their ``visualize`` methods.

This is a basic use of **PyAutoFit**'s graphical modeling capabilities, which support advanced hierarchical 
and probabilistic modeling for large, multi-dataset analyses.

.. code-block:: python

    factor_graph = af.FactorGraphModel(*analysis_factor_list)

To inspect the model, we print `factor_graph.global_prior_model.info`.

.. code-block:: python

    print(factor_graph.global_prior_model.info)

To fit multiple datasets, we pass the `FactorGraphModel` to a non-linear search.

Unlike single-dataset fitting, we now pass the `factor_graph.global_prior_model` as the model and 
the `factor_graph` itself as the analysis object.

This structure enables simultaneous fitting of multiple datasets in a consistent and scalable way.

.. code-block:: python

    search = af.DynestyStatic(
        path_prefix="features", sample="rwalk", name="multiple_datasets_simple"
    )
    
    result_list = search.fit(model=factor_graph.global_prior_model, analysis=factor_graph)

Result List
-----------

The result object returned by the fit is a list of the ``Result`` objects, which is described in the result cookbook.

Each ``Result`` in the list corresponds to each ``Analysis`` object in the ``analysis_list`` we passed to the fit.

The same model was fitted across all analyses, thus every ``Result`` in the ``result_list`` contains the same information 
on the samples and the same ``max_log_likelihood_instance``.

.. code-block:: python

    print(result_list[0].max_log_likelihood_instance.centre)
    print(result_list[0].max_log_likelihood_instance.normalization)
    print(result_list[0].max_log_likelihood_instance.sigma)

    print(result_list[1].max_log_likelihood_instance.centre)
    print(result_list[1].max_log_likelihood_instance.normalization)
    print(result_list[1].max_log_likelihood_instance.sigma)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    49.99110500540554
    24.793778321608457
    10.067848301502565
    49.99110500540554
    24.793778321608457
    10.067848301502565

We can plot the model-fit to each dataset by iterating over the results:

.. code-block:: python

    for data, result in zip(data_list, result_list):
        instance = result.max_log_likelihood_instance

        model_data = instance.model_data_from(
            xvalues=np.arange(data.shape[0])
        )

        plt.errorbar(
            x=xvalues,
            y=data,
            yerr=noise_map,
            color="k",
            ecolor="k",
            elinewidth=1,
            capsize=2,
        )
        plt.plot(xvalues, model_data, color="r")
        plt.title("Dynesty model fit to 1D Gaussian dataset.")
        plt.xlabel("x values of profile")
        plt.ylabel("Profile normalization")
        plt.show()
        plt.close()

Variable Model Across Datasets
------------------------------

The same model was fitted to every dataset simultaneously because all 3 datasets contained an identical signal with 
only the noise varying across the datasets.

If the signal varied across the datasets, we would instead want to fit a different model to each dataset. The model
composition can be updated by changing the model passed to each ``AnalysisFactor``.

We will use an example of 3 1D Gaussians which have the same ``centre`` but the ``normalization`` and ``sigma`` vary across 
datasets:

.. code-block:: python

    dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "example_1d", "gaussian_x1_variable")

    dataset_name_list = ["sigma_0", "sigma_1", "sigma_2"]

    data_list = []
    noise_map_list = []

    for dataset_name in dataset_name_list:
        dataset_time_path = path.join(dataset_path, dataset_name)

        data = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(
            file_path=path.join(dataset_time_path, "data.json")
        )
        noise_map = af.util.numpy_array_from_json(
            file_path=path.join(dataset_time_path, "noise_map.json")
        )

        data_list.append(data)
        noise_map_list.append(noise_map)

Plotting these datasets shows that the ``normalization`` and`` ``sigma`` of each Gaussian vary.

.. code-block:: python

    for data, noise_map in zip(data_list, noise_map_list):
        xvalues = range(data.shape[0])

        af.ex.plot_profile_1d(xvalues=xvalues, profile_1d=data)

The images appear as follows:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit/feature/docs_update/docs/images/multi_model_data_0.png
  :width: 300

The ``centre`` of all three 1D Gaussians are the same in each dataset, but their ``normalization`` and ``sigma`` values 
are decreasing.

We will therefore fit a model to all three datasets simultaneously, whose ``centre`` is the same for all 3 datasets but
the ``normalization`` and ``sigma`` vary.

To do that, we use a summed list of ``Analysis`` objects, where each ``Analysis`` object contains a different dataset.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis_list = []

    for data, noise_map in zip(data_list, noise_map_list):
        analysis = af.ex.Analysis(data=data, noise_map=noise_map)
        analysis_list.append(analysis)

We now update the model passed to each ``AnalysisFactor ``object to compose a model where: 

 - The ``centre`` values of the Gaussian fitted to every dataset in every ``Analysis`` object are identical. 

 - The``normalization`` and ``sigma`` value of the every Gaussian fitted to every dataset in every ``Analysis`` object 
   are different.

The model has 7 free parameters in total, x1 shared ``centre``, x3 unique ``normalization``'s and x3 unique ``sigma``'s.

We do this by overwriting the ``normalization`` and ``sigma`` variables of the model passed to each ``AnalysisFactor`` object
with new priors, that make them free parameters of the model.

.. code-block:: python

    analysis_factor_list = []
    
    for analysis in analysis_list:
    
        model_analysis = model.copy()
    
        model_analysis.normalization = af.LogUniformPrior(
            lower_limit=1e-2, upper_limit=1e2
        )
        model_analysis.sigma = af.GaussianPrior(
            mean=10.0, sigma=5.0, lower_limit=0.0, upper_limit=np.inf
        )
    
        analysis_factor = af.AnalysisFactor(prior_model=model_analysis, analysis=analysis)
    
        analysis_factor_list.append(analysis_factor)

To inspect this model, with extra parameters for each dataset created, we print `factor_graph.global_prior_model.info`.

.. code-block:: python
    
    factor_graph = af.FactorGraphModel(*analysis_factor_list)
    
    print(factor_graph.global_prior_model.info)

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

Fit this model to the data using dynesty.

.. code-block:: python

    search = af.DynestyStatic(
        path_prefix="features", sample="rwalk", name="multiple_datasets_free_sigma"
    )
    
    result_list = search.fit(model=factor_graph.global_prior_model, analysis=factor_graph)


The ``normalization`` and ``sigma`` values of the maximum log likelihood models fitted to each dataset are different, 
which is shown by printing the ``sigma`` values of the maximum log likelihood instances of each result.

The ``centre`` values of the maximum log likelihood models fitted to each dataset are the same.

.. code-block:: python

    for result in result_list:
        instance = result.max_log_likelihood_instance

        print("Max Log Likelihood Model:")
        print("Centre = ", instance.centre)
        print("Normalization = ", instance.normalization)
        print("Sigma = ", instance.sigma)
        print()

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Max Log Likelihood Model:
    Centre =  50.06514422642149
    Normalization =  50.25307503344711

    Centre =  50.06514422642149
    Normalization =  50.35148002406068
    Sigma =  30.49164712448904

Relational Model
----------------

In the model above, two extra free parameters (``normalization and ``sigma``) were added for every dataset. 

For just 3 datasets the model stays low dimensional and this is not a problem. However, for 30+ datasets the model
will become complex and difficult to fit.

In these circumstances, one can instead compose a model where the parameters vary smoothly across the datasets
via a user defined relation.

Below, we compose a model where the ``sigma`` value fitted to each dataset is computed according to:


.. code-block:: bash

    ``y = m * x + c`` : ``sigma`` = sigma_m * x + sigma_c``

Where x is an integer number specifying the index of the dataset (e.g. 1, 2 and 3).

By defining a relation of this form, ``sigma_m`` and ``sigma_c`` are the only free parameters of the model which vary
across the datasets. 

Of more datasets are added the number of model parameters therefore does not increase.

.. code-block:: python

    model = af.Collection(gaussian=af.Model(af.ex.Gaussian))

    sigma_m = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=-10.0, upper_limit=10.0)
    sigma_c = af.UniformPrior(lower_limit=-10.0, upper_limit=10.0)

    x_list = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

    analysis_factor_list = []

    for x, analysis in zip(x_list, analysis_list):
        sigma_relation = (sigma_m * x) + sigma_c

        model_analysis = model.copy()
        model_analysis.gaussian.sigma = sigma_relation

        analysis_factor = af.AnalysisFactor(prior_model=model_analysis, analysis=analysis)

        analysis_factor_list.append(analysis_factor)

The factor graph is created and its info can be printed after the relational model has been defined.

.. code-block:: python

    factor_graph = af.FactorGraphModel(*analysis_factor_list)

    print(factor_graph.global_prior_model.info)

This gives the following output:

We can fit the model as per usual.

.. code-block:: python

    search = af.DynestyStatic(
        path_prefix="features", sample="rwalk", name="multiple_datasets_relation"
    )
    
    result_list = search.fit(model=factor_graph.global_prior_model, analysis=factor_graph)

The ``centre`` and ``sigma`` values of the maximum log likelihood models fitted to each dataset are different, 
which is shown by printing the ``sigma`` values of the maximum log likelihood instances of each result.

They now follow the relation we defined above.

The ``centre`` normalization of the maximum log likelihood models fitted to each dataset are the same.

.. code-block:: python

    result_list = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

    for result in result_list:
        instance = result.max_log_likelihood_instance

        print("Max Log Likelihood Model:")
        print("Centre = ", instance.centre)
        print("Normalization = ", instance.normalization)
        print("Sigma = ", instance.sigma)
        print()

This gives the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Max Log Likelihood Model:
    Centre =  50.04124738060383
    Normalization =  50.330187946622246

Different Analysis Objects
--------------------------

For simplicity, this example used a single `Analysis` class which fitted 1D Gaussian's to 1D data.

For many problems one may have multiple datasets which are quite different in their format and structure. In this
situation, one can simply define unique `Analysis` objects for each type of dataset, which will contain a
unique `log_likelihood_function` and methods for visualization.

Hierarchical / Graphical Models
-------------------------------

The analysis factor API illustrated here can then be used to fit this large variety of datasets, noting that the
the model can also be customized as necessary for fitting models to multiple datasets that are different in their
format and structure.

This allows us to fit large heterogeneous datasets simultaneously, but also forms the basis of the graphical
modeling API which can be used to fit complex models, such as hierarchical models, to extract more information
from large datasets.

**PyAutoFit** has a dedicated feature set for fitting hierarchical and graphical models and interested readers should
checkout the hierarchical and graphical modeling
chapter of **HowToFit** (https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_graphical_models.html)

Interpolation
-------------

One may have many datasets which vary according to a smooth function, for example a dataset taken over time where
the signal varies smoothly as a function of time.

This could be fitted using the tools above, all at once. However, in many use cases this is not possible due to the
model complexity, number of datasets or computational time.

An alternative approach is to fit each dataset individually, and then interpolate the results over the smoothly
varying parameter (e.g. time) to estimate the model parameters at any point.

**PyAutoFit** has interpolation tools to do exactly this, which are described in the `features/interpolation.ipynb`
example.


Wrap Up
--------

We have shown how **PyAutoFit** can fit large datasets simultaneously, using custom models that vary specific
parameters across the dataset.
