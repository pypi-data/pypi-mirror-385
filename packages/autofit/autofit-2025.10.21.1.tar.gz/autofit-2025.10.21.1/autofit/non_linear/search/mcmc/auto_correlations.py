        Class for performing and customizing AutoCorrelation calculations, which are used:

         - After a model-fit is finished to investigate whether the resutls converged.

        Parameters
        ----------
        check_for_convergence
            Whether the auto-correlation lengths of the Emcee samples are checked to determine the stopping criteria.
            If `True`, this option may terminate the Emcee run before the input number of steps, nsteps, has
            been performed. If `False` nstep samples will be taken.
        check_size
            The length of the samples used to check the auto-correlation lengths (from the latest sample backwards).
            For convergence, the auto-correlations must not change over a certain range of samples. A longer check-size
            thus requires more samples meet the auto-correlation threshold, taking longer to terminate sampling.
            However, shorter chains risk stopping sampling early due to noise.
        required_length
            The length an auto_correlation chain must be for it to be used to evaluate whether its change threshold is
            sufficiently small to terminate sampling early.
        change_threshold
            The threshold value by which if the change in auto_correlations is below sampling will be terminated early.
