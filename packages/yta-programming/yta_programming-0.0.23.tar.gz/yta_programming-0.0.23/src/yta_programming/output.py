        This method handles the provided 'output_filename' and
        the also given 'extension' to obtain the correct
        filename if needed. This has been created to simplify
        the way we handle the 'output_filename' param when
        working with our different libraries.

        Providing a FileType instance as 'extension' parameter
        will check if the provided 'output_filename' has an
        extension of that file type and preserve it, or use
        the default one if filename extension doesn't fit the
        desired type (or even the filename doesn't have any
        extension). Providing a FileExtension instance as
        'extension' parameter will force that extension for
        the generated output filename.
