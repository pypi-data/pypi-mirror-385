**MDAnalysis** (`www.mdanalysis.org`_) is an object-oriented python
toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories generated by
CHARMM_, Gromacs_, Amber_, NAMD_, LAMMPS_, `DL_POLY`_ and other
packages; it also reads other formats (e.g., PDB_ files and `XYZ
format`_ trajectories; see :ref:`Supported coordinate formats` and
:ref:`Supported topology formats` for the full lists). It can write
most of these formats, too, together with atom selections for use in
Gromacs_, CHARMM_, VMD_ and PyMol_ (see :ref:`Selection exporters`).

It allows one to read molecular dynamics trajectories and access the
atomic coordinates through `NumPy`_ arrays. This provides a flexible and
relatively fast framework for complex analysis tasks. Fairly complete
atom :ref:`selection-commands-label` are implemented. Trajectories can
also be manipulated (for instance, fit to a reference structure) and
written out in a range of formats.

Installing and using MDAnalysis
===============================

The MDAnalysis `User Guide`_ provides comprehensive information on how to `install`_
and use the library. We would recommend that new users have a look at the
`Quick Start Guide`_. The User Guide also has a set of `examples`_ on how to
use the MDAnalysis library which may be of interest.
