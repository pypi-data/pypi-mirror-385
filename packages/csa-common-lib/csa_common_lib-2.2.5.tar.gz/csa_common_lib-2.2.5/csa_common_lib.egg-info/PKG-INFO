# Cambridge Sports Analytics Common Library

`csa_common_lib` is a shared library designed to provide utility modules, class definitions, enumerations, and helper functions for the CSA Prediction Engine Python client. It standardizes and simplifies complex operations across different parts of the system.

## Folder Structure

- **`classes/`**: Contains class definitions for prediction-related data structures.
  - `prediction_options.py`: Defines options and configurations for predictions.
  - `prediction_receipt.py`: Structures data related to prediction receipts.
  - `prediction_results.py`: Contains classes for handling prediction results.
  
- **`enum_types/`**: Contains enumerations that categorize various elements of the system.
  - `exit_flags.py`: Defines exit flag states used during execution.
  - `functions.py`: Enumerates available functions in the system.
  - `job_types.py`: Enumerates different job types for concurrency.

- **`helpers/`**: Provides helper functions for common low-level tasks.
  - `_arrays.py`: Array manipulation and utility functions.
  - `_conversions.py`: Data conversion utilities.
  - `_os.py`: Functions for interacting with the operating system.

- **`toolbox/`**: A general-purpose set of utilities.
  - **`classes/utilities.py`**: Utilities for class objects.
  - **`concurrency/`**: Tools for concurrent execution.
  - **`database/`**: Database related tools and utilities.
  - **`npz/`**: NPZ utility functions.

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the prediction class options from the common library:

```python
from csa_common_lib.classes.prediction_options import {
        PredictionOptions,
        MaxFitOptions,
        GridOptions
    }
```
