Ancestry analysis implementation.

This module implements functions for analyzing ancestry coefficients and migration
flux patterns over time based on discrete parsimony reconstructions.

Based on the C implementations in:
- src/treeseq_sankoff_discrete_ancestry.c 
- src/treeseq_sankoff_discrete_flux.c
