_DEFAULT_WRITE_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
A tool for writing initial plan — can only be used once, at the very beginning. 
Use update_plan for subsequent modifications.

Args:
    plan: The list of plan items to write. Each string in the list represents 
          the content of one plan item.

_DEFAULT_UPDATE_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = (
    WRITE_TODOS_TOOL_DESCRIPTION
) = """Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current work session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.

Only use this tool if you think it will be helpful in staying organized. If the user's request is trivial and takes less than 3 steps, it is better to NOT use this tool and just do the task directly.

## Tool Division
- **write_plan**: Used to create an initial plan framework for complex tasks
- **update_plan**: Used to dynamically update progress and adjust the plan during task execution

## Usage Scenarios
Use this tool in the following situations:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Project-level complex tasks - Work involving multiple phases, dependencies, or resource coordination
3. User explicitly requests a task list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. The plan may need dynamic adjustments based on execution results

## Plan Creation (write_plan)
**Usage Scenarios**:
- Need to create a complete execution framework at project initiation
- Complex tasks require phased approaches and clear dependencies
- Long-term work requires resource planning and milestone setting

**Important Specifications**:
- When creating the initial plan, the FIRST task should automatically be set to "in_progress" status
- No additional status updates are needed during plan creation - the initial state is properly configured

**Plan Elements**:
- Phase division: Divide work phases according to logical or chronological order
- Dependencies: Clarify sequential dependencies and relationships between tasks
- Milestones: Set key nodes and deliverable standards
- Resource planning: Estimate required time, tools, or external resources

## Plan Update (update_plan)
**Usage Scenarios**:
- Task status changes need real-time reflection
- Need to adjust execution path when encountering obstacles
- User proposes new requirements or modifies existing ones
- Discover more optimized execution methods

**Critical Update Principle**:
- **ONLY pass the specific tasks that require modification** - do not resend the entire plan
- The system will intelligently merge your partial updates with the existing plan
- This ensures efficient updates and prevents unnecessary data transfer

**Update Principles**:
- Real-time updates: Update the plan immediately after task status changes
- Partial updates: Only modify the tasks that actually changed status or content
- Transparent progress: Accurately reflect completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
- Flexible adjustments: Reasonably adjust subsequent arrangements based on actual situation

## Task States and Management Standards

1. **Available Task States**:
   - **"pending"**: Task not yet started (waiting to be processed)
   - **"in_progress"**: Currently actively working on this task
   - **"done"**: Task fully completed and verified
   - *Note: These three states are the ONLY available options - no other status values are accepted*

2. **Task Management**:
   - First task is automatically set to "in_progress" when plan is created via write_plan
   - Mark tasks as "done" immediately upon completion using update_plan
   - Update only the specific tasks that change status - no need to resend unchanged tasks
   - Always maintain at least one "in_progress" task while work is ongoing

3. **Completion Standards**:
   - ONLY mark a task as "done" when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - Maintain "in_progress" status when encountering obstacles or partial completion
   - Never mark a task as "done" if:
     * There are unresolved errors or issues
     * Work is partial or incomplete
     * Quality standards haven't been met

4. **Task Breakdown Principles**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

## Prohibited Scenarios
Avoid using this tool in the following cases:
1. When there is only a single simple task
2. When the task can be completed in less than 3 simple steps
3. For purely conversational or informational tasks
4. For temporary simple queries or operations

**Important Reminder**: 
- Use write_plan for initial plan creation - first task automatically becomes "in_progress"
- Use update_plan for subsequent changes - only pass the specific tasks that need modification
- Remember: Only three valid states exist - "pending", "in_progress", and "done"
- For simple tasks with clear execution paths, execute directly without planning
