Python Postgres
</h1>

---

Python Postgres aims to simplify PostgreSQL interaction in Python. It's a thin abstraction
over [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/index.html) that uses SQL directly, avoiding ORM-specific syntax
while offering ORM-like benefits like Pydantic model parsing for expanded editor support, and reduced boilerplate. It
retains full SQL flexibility and access to underlying psycopg features.
