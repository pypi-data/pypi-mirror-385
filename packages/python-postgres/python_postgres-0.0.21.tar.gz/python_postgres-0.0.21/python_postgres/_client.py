        Initialize the Postgres class to connect to a PostgreSQL database. This will create a
        connection Pool with the given parameters. The connection pool is not opened until the first
        query is executed. This has little performance impact, since you can use the first
        connection while the others are opened in the background and prevents prematurely acquiring
        connections that are not needed.

        :param user: The username to connect to the database.
        :param password: The password for the given user to connect to the database.
        :param host: The host of the database.
        :param port: The port of the database, default is 5432.
        :param database: The database name to connect to, default is `postgres`.
        :param pool_min_size: The minimum number of connections to keep in the pool.
        :param pool_max_size: The maximum number of connections to keep in the pool.
        :param patch: A list of functions to call on the connection after it is created. This is
               useful to set up the connection with custom settings, like enabling extensions.
        :param name: An optional name to give to the connection pool, to identify it in the logs.
                     Default to `python-postgres` to distinguish it from other pools that may be
                     active.
        :param timeout: The timeout in seconds to wait for a connection to be acquired from the
                        pool. Default is 30 seconds.
        :param max_waiting: The maximum number of waiting connections to allow. Default is 0, which
                            means no limit.
        :param max_lifetime: The maximum lifetime of a connection in seconds. Default is 60 minutes.
        :param max_idle: The maximum idle time of a connection in seconds. Default is 10 minutes.
        :param reconnect_timeout: The timeout in seconds to wait for a connection to be reconnected
                                    from the pool. Default is 5 minutes.
