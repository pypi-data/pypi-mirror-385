## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Simple Key Access
**Test:** `get("welcome")`

```
i18n_modern:   0.38µs (baseline - fastest)
python-i18n:   1.54µs (4.1x slower)
pyi18n-v2:     1.10µs (2.9x slower)
```

**Analysis:**
- i18n_modern maintains excellent performance with optimized tuple-based caching
- python-i18n performs extra file system checks and configuration lookups
- pyi18n-v2 provides good performance but still slower than i18n_modern
- All are acceptable for simple operations, but i18n_modern has a clear advantage

---

### 2. Nested Key Access ⭐ MOST SIGNIFICANT (432x faster!)
**Test:** `get("messages.success")`

```
i18n_modern:   0.37µs (baseline - FASTEST)
python-i18n:   159.64µs (432x slower) ❌
pyi18n-v2:     1.04µs (2.8x slower)
```

**Analysis:**
This is the most dramatic difference:

- **i18n_modern uses the Visitor pattern** (`TreePathVisitor`) for efficient nested traversal
- **Enhanced visitor pool** with pre-allocation eliminates allocation overhead
- **python-i18n creates a new file loading operation** for each nested access (major bottleneck)
- **pyi18n-v2 performs better than python-i18n** but still significantly slower than i18n_modern
- The 432x speedup demonstrates the effectiveness of:
  - Visitor pattern for structured tree traversal
  - Improved visitor pooling with pre-allocation
  - In-memory caching of resolved paths
  - Eliminating unnecessary file I/O

### 3. Parameter Substitution
**Test:** `get("greeting", values={"name": "Alice"})`

```
i18n_modern:   1.21µs (baseline - fastest)
python-i18n:   1.77µs (1.5x slower)
pyi18n-v2:     2.09µs (1.7x slower)
```

**Analysis:**
- i18n_modern's regex-based substitution is efficient
- Enhanced Cython directives provide better optimization in compiled code
- Expression caching improves performance for repeated patterns
- python-i18n also performs well on this operation
- Difference is less dramatic but still favorable to i18n_modern

---

### 4. Conditional Logic
**Test:** `get("age_group", values={"age": 25})` with complex conditions

```
i18n_modern:   1.80µs (with expression caching)
```

**Analysis:**
- i18n_modern successfully handles conditional expressions with AST parsing
- Expression parsing is now cached (512-entry LRU cache)
- Evaluation is cached (10,000 iterations test)
- Performance is excellent even with complex logic
- Neither python-i18n nor pyi18n-v2 support this feature

---

### 5. Cache Effectiveness
**Test:** Repeated calls with the same parameters (100 iterations)

```
i18n_modern:   1.24µs average
```

**Analysis:**
- The tuple-based caching mechanism provides excellent cache hit rates
- Visitor pool pre-allocation reduces allocation overhead
- Bounded cache with FIFO eviction prevents unbounded growth
- Repeated translations benefit from instant dictionary lookups
- Consistent performance across multiple runs
