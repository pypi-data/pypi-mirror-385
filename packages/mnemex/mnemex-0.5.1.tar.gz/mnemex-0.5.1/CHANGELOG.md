- Docs: CONTRIBUTING adds pre-commit instructions; SECURITY documents SBOM

### Fixed
- Security workflow SBOM flags corrected to use cyclonedx-py with `--output-format` and `--output-file`

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-09

üéâ **Production Release: Mnemex v1.0.0**

This is the first production-ready release of Mnemex (formerly STM Research/STM Server), a temporal memory management system for AI assistants with human-like memory dynamics.

### üöÄ Major Features

#### Complete Rebranding
- **Renamed from STM Research/STM Server to Mnemex**
  - Updated all references, paths, and documentation
  - Changed storage paths from `~/.stm/` to `~/.config/mnemex/` (XDG-compliant)
  - Updated command names from `stm-*` to `mnemex-*`
  - Updated environment variables from `STM_*` to `MNEMEX_*`
  - Repository moved to https://github.com/simplemindedbot/mnemex

#### Simplified Installation
- **UV Tool Install Support**
  - One-command installation: `uv tool install git+https://github.com/simplemindedbot/mnemex.git`
  - Simplified MCP configuration: `{"command": "mnemex"}` (no more complex paths)
  - All configuration moved to `~/.config/mnemex/.env` (not MCP config)
  - Automatic installation of all 7 CLI commands

#### Memory Consolidation
- **Algorithmic Memory Consolidation** (`consolidate_memories` tool)
  - Smart content merging with duplicate detection
  - Preview mode to see proposed merges before applying
  - Apply mode to execute consolidation
  - Auto-detection of high-cohesion clusters
  - Metadata merging: tags, entities, timestamps, strength
  - Relation tracking via `consolidated_from` links
  - Strength bonuses based on cluster cohesion (capped at 2.0)
  - 100% test coverage (15 tests)

#### Privacy & Local Storage
- **Emphasized Local-First Design**
  - All data stored locally (no cloud services, no tracking)
  - Human-readable JSONL format for short-term memory
  - Markdown files (Obsidian-compatible) for long-term memory
  - Git-friendly formats for version control
  - Complete user control and transparency

### üì¶ Added
