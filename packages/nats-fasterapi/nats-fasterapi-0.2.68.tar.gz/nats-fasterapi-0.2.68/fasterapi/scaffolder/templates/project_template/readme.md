# 🚀 FasterAPI Scaffold CLI

FasterAPI is a lightweight scaffolding tool that helps you quickly spin up FastAPI projects with predefined folder structures, schemas, and CRUD repository templates. It's built to save time and enforce consistency.

---

## 📦 Features

- Auto-generates a complete FastAPI project structure
- Creates `schemas/` with `Base`, `Create`, `Update`, and `Out` models
- Generates CRUD logic in `repository/`
- CLI-powered — just type and scaffold

## 🏗️ How the Project Was Created

This project was scaffolded using the `fasterapi` CLI tool:

```bash
fasterapi make_project my_project
cd my_project
````

To generate schema and repo files:

```bash
fasterapi make_repo user_profile
```

This will create:

```
schemas/user_profile.py
repository/user_profile.py
```

The schema includes:

* `UserProfileBase`
* `UserProfileCreate` (with `date_created` and `last_updated`)
* `UserProfileUpdate` (with `last_updated`)
* `UserProfileOut` (with `_id`, timestamps)
