# A generator of polynomial machine learning potentials

`pypolymlp` is a Python code designed for the development of polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) based on datasets generated from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The code provides functionalities for fitting polynomial models to energy, force, and stress data, enabling the construction of accurate and computationally efficient interatomic potentials.
In addition to potential development, `pypolymlp` allows users to compute various physical properties and perform atomistic simulations using the trained MLPs.

## Polynomial machine learning potentials
A polynomial MLP represents the potential energy as a polynomial function of linearly independent polynomial invariants of the O(3) group. Developed polynomial MLPs are available in [Polynomial Machine Learning Potential Repository](http://cms.mtl.kyoto-u.ac.jp/seko/mlp-repository/index.html).

### Calculations using polynomial MLP
In version 0.8.0 or earlier, polymlp files are generated in a plain text format as `polymlp.lammps`.
Starting from version 0.9.0, the files are generated in YAML format as `polymlp.yaml`.
Both formats are supported by the following command-line interface and the Python API.
