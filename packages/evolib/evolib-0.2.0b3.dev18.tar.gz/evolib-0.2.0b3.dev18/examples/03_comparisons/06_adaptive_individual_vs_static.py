"""
Example 04-06 â€“ Adaptive Individual Mutation vs. Static Mutation.

This example compares the effectiveness of adaptive mutation at the individual level
with a static mutation strength. Each individual has its own mutation strength and tau
value that adapts over time.

Note:
    Reproducibility is controlled via the `random_seed` field in the YAML config.
    Set it to an integer for deterministic runs or to null/omit it for stochastic runs.
