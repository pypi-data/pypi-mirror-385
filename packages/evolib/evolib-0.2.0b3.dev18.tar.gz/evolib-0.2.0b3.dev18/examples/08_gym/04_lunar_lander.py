"""
Example: LunarLander with EvoLib

This script demonstrates how to evolve a neural network controller
for the classic **LunarLander-v3** Gymnasium environment.
Each individualâ€™s network is evaluated by running a full episode
and using the negative cumulative reward as fitness (minimization).
At the end of selected generations, the best agent is visualized
and exported as an animated GIF for inspection.
