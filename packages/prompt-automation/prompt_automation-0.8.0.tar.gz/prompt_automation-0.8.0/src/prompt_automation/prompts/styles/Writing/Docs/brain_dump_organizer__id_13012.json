    "Reshape {{notes}} into an organized summary with themes, action items, insights, and a parking lot.",

    "- notes: {{notes}}",
    "",

    "Assumption: Preserve key user phrasing where it clarifies intent.",

    "## Constraints",
    "- Actions require owner/role, priority, and suggested timeline (or mark TBD).",

    "## Instructions",
    "1. Detect themes — topics, projects, questions, emotions; note grouping assumptions.",
    "2. Categorize — cluster into sections while retaining key phrasing.",
    "3. Extract insights — observations, decisions, concerns.",
    "4. Derive actions — convert into tasks with owner/role, priority, timeline.",
    "5. Parking lot — items needing incubation with revisit triggers.",

    "2) Categorize",
    "3) Insights",
    "4) Actions",
    "5) Parking lot",
    "",
    "## Output Format",
    "1. Overview — 2–3 sentences summarizing dominant themes and intent.",
    "2. Structured Themes — markdown headings with nested bullets (preserve key phrases).",
    "3. Action Items — table: Action | Owner/Role | Priority | Suggested Timeline | Notes.",
    "4. Insights & Reflections — bullets for aha moments, patterns, emotions, questions.",
    "5. Parking Lot — bullets with revisit triggers or dates.",
    "",
    "## Quality Checks",
    "- Key user phrasing retained where context matters.",
    "- Actions are specific, prioritized, and time-oriented (or marked TBD with follow-up).",

    "- Output structure is copy-friendly.",

    "- pass_if(count(themes) >= 2)",
