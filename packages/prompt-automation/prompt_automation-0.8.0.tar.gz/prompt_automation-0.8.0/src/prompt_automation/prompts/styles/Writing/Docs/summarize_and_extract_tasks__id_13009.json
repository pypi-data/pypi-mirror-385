    "1. Identify purpose, participants, outcomes; note assumptions if missing.",

    "1. Summary — 4–6 bullet sentences: objective, highlights, decisions, dependencies.",
    "2. Task Table — table: Task | Owner | Due Date | Status (Not Started/In Progress/Done/Blocked) | Context/Notes.",
    "3. Decisions & Rationale — bullets pairing each decision with reasoning and related tasks.",
    "4. Open Questions & Risks — bullets for unclear details, missing owners, or risks.",
    "",
    "## Quality Checks",
    "- Every task has owner or TBD with follow-up.",
