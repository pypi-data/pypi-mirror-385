    "Assumption: If scope is unclear, state assumptions about intent, expertise, timeframe.",

    "## Constraints",
    "- Cite reputable sources or label as informed inference with confidence.",
    "- Focus on leverage; avoid encyclopedic detail.",

    "## Instructions",
    "1. Intent decode — infer objective, context, urgency; log assumptions.",
    "2. Key questions — list 3–5 leverage questions and answer succinctly with citations.",
    "3. Core concepts — extract foundational models/components/workflows explaining practical function.",
    "4. Fast-track application — outline first experiments/checklists/practice reps yielding progress within days.",
    "5. Source curation — select 3–5 authoritative references with credibility notes and usage guidance.",
    "6. Watch-outs — note pitfalls, misconceptions, and deeper-research signals.",

    "1. Quick Primer — 3–5 bullets: definition, value, primary use cases, urgency triggers.",
    "2. High-Leverage Concepts — table: Concept | Why in 20% | Practical implication/decision aided.",
    "3. Fast-Track Actions — ordered steps or experiments with expected outcomes and effort.",
    "4. Sources & Signals — vetted resources with one-line credibility notes and when to go deeper.",
    "5. Watch-outs & Open Questions — bullets for risks, gaps, next investigation areas.",
    "",
    "## Quality Checks",
    "- Every fact is cited or labeled as inference with confidence.",
    "- Content focuses on leverage enabling action.",
    "- Actions are immediately doable with expected outcomes.",
    "- Assumptions and unresolved questions are flagged.",
    "- Tone is concise and confidence-weighted.",
