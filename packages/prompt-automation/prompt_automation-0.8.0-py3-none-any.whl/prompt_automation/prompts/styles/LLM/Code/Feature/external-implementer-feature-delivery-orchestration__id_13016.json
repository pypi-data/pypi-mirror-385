Implementer models are **GitHub Copilot (codebase context enabled)** and/or **Codex**; assume they have recursive repository access for discovery.",

    "",
    "  * **Before generating**, re-read **AGENTS.md** and **integrate its requirements** into every section below **by reference** (do not duplicate text). If a requirement conflicts with user directions, prefer **AGENTS.md** and call it out under **CONSTRAINTS**.",

    "* **Enforce AGENTS.md** for all standing constraints (e.g., size limits, TDD, rollout, observability, security/privacy, performance budgets, migrations, GUI/CLI policy, install/versioning). Do not restate them here.",
    "* Direct the implementer to **search @workspace first** (assume monorepo; self-discover languages/dirs; prefer codebase-aware search in Copilot/Codex) and reuse existing logic before adding new code.",
    "* When constraints are unspecified by the user, **inherit AGENTS.md defaults**; record any additional task-specific constraints you introduce.",
