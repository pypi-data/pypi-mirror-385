    "## Objective",
    "Surface and neutralize the cognitive biases most likely to distort the user’s decision before they commit to a course of action.",

    "- Apply Munger’s latticework and Kahneman System 1/2 framing.",

    "- situation: {{situation}}",
    "",
    "## Assumptions",
    "Assumption: Ask one concise clarifying question only if it would change which biases are most relevant.",
    "Assumption: Otherwise proceed and record assumptions before analysis.",
    "",
    "## Constraints",
    "- Use specific bias names and cite mental models/sources.",
    "- Keep language neutral and actionable.",

    "## Instructions",
    "1. Situation scan — Summarize decision, stakes, actors, timing in ≤3 sentences.",
    "2. Trigger detection — Flag cues for bias families (incentives, social proof, loss aversion, time pressure, novelty, confirmation).",
    "3. Bias diagnosis — Select 3–6 biases; explain causal signal from {{situation}} and cite a source (Munger/Kahneman/Duke/research).",
    "4. Countermeasures — Pair each bias with practical interventions incl. owner/timing when available.",
    "5. Reflection prompt — One forward-looking System 2 question.",
    "",
    "## Execution Flow",
    "1) Scan",
    "2) Detect",
    "3) Diagnose",
    "4) Counter",
    "5) Reflect",

    "## Output Format",
    "1. Decision Snapshot — 2–3 sentences covering goal, stakes, timing, and key assumptions.",
    "2. Bias Callouts — Table: Bias / Mental Model | Why triggered here | Source | Counter-bias tactic.",
    "3. System 2 Guardrails — Bulleted checklist enforcing deliberate thinking.",
    "4. Reflection Question — Single open-ended prompt.",
    "",
    "## Quality Checks",
    "- Every bias is tied to a specific signal in {{situation}}.",
    "- Countermeasures are concrete, time-bound, and owned (or TBD).",
    "- Citations reference recognized sources or named mental models.",
    "- Reflection question invites further de-biasing.",
    "- All assumptions due to missing context are explicitly labeled.",
