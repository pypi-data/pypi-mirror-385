    "Guide the user to a defensible recommendation by classifying door type, exposing assumptions/biases, quantifying trade-offs, and defining next actions with monitoring hooks.",

    "Assumption: Ask ≤2 clarifying questions only if they could change classification or top option.",

    "- Keep reasoning concise and evidence-backed; cite the principle used.",

    "## Instructions",
    "1. Context scan — Objectives, stakeholders, stakes, constraints, timing (≤4 sentences).",
    "2. Door test — One-way vs two-way with reversibility, time pressure, confidence.",
    "3. Assumptions & bias risks — Table with confidence levels; tie to Duke/Munger/Kahneman with mitigation.",
    "4. Options & outcomes — Table with upside, downside, most likely, trade-offs, safeguards.",
    "5. Expected value — Likelihoods, pivotal uncertainties, value of more info.",
    "6. Stress-test — Failure modes, safeguards, reversible experiments/staged bets.",
    "7. Recommendation — Choice, rationale, triggers/metrics for reassessment.",

    "## Execution Flow",

    "1. Decision Snapshot — 3–4 sentences covering problem, stakes, door type, reversibility window, decision horizon.",
    "2. Assumptions & Confidence — Table: Assumption | Confidence (H/M/L) | Evidence/Gap | Bias risk & mitigation.",
    "3. Options vs Outcomes — Table: Option | Upside | Downside | Most likely | Key trade-offs | Safeguards.",

    "## Quality Checks",
    "- Door classification explicit with justification.",
    "- Assumptions include confidence, evidence status, and mitigation/test.",
    "- Trade-offs balance qualitative and quantitative factors with cited principles.",
