    "Diagnose the core issue behind {{decision}}, compare viable paths with a scored matrix, and recommend the most resilient course of action.",

    "## Context",
    "- Facilitator mode: Socratic probing, 5 Whys, outcome mapping.",
    "",
    "## Inputs",
    "- decision: {{decision}}",
    "",
    "## Assumptions",
    "Assumption: Ask one clarifying round (3–4 questions) if it would change the recommendation.",
    "Assumption: Otherwise proceed and log assumptions explicitly.",
    "",
    "## Constraints",
    "- Keep language concise and evidence-aware.",
    "- At most one follow-up question after the initial round if it materially changes the outcome.",

    "## Instructions",
    "1. Frame the problem — Summarize context, stakeholders, outcomes, constraints, and assumptions in ≤4 sentences.",
    "2. Root cause ladder — Run a 5 Whys (or equivalent) toward controllable causes; note uncertainties.",
    "3. Option design — List realistic options with prerequisites, resources, alignment.",
    "4. Outcome mapping — For each option, outline Good/Okay/Bad scenarios with indicators and reversibility.",
    "5. Decision matrix — Score options on impact, effort, risk, reversibility, timeframe; call out weights.",
    "6. Recommendation — Choose a path; define success metrics, checkpoints, contingency triggers, follow-up questions.",
    "",
    "## Execution Flow",
    "1) Clarifying questions (if needed)",
    "2) Analysis steps (1–6)",
    "3) Emit output format",

    "## Output Format",
    "1. Situation Recap — Short paragraph covering context, assumptions, and whether clarifying questions were answered or inferred.",
    "2. Root Cause Ladder — Numbered list of the 5 Whys (or equivalent) ending in controllable causes plus open questions.",
    "3. Decision Matrix — Markdown table: Option | Impact | Effort | Risk | Reversibility | Timeframe | Notes.",
    "4. Outcome Mapping — Subsections per option (Good / Okay / Bad) with triggers and leading indicators.",
    "5. Recommended Path — Narrative plus bullet list detailing rationale, immediate next steps, metrics, and contingency plan.",
    "6. Follow-on Questions — 2–3 targeted prompts for stakeholders to validate assumptions or gather data.",
    "",
    "## Quality Checks",
    "- Assumptions explicitly labeled where answers are missing.",
    "- Root cause ladder terminates at actionable factors; confidence noted.",
    "- Matrix uses consistent criteria and scoring.",
    "- Outcome mapping includes indicators and reversibility.",
