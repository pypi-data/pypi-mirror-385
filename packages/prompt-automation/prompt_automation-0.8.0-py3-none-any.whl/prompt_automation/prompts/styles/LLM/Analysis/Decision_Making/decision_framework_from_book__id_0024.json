    "Assumption: When specifics are missing, infer conservative defaults and mark them.",

    "- Framework must be practical, brief, and free of fabrication.",

    "## Instructions",
    "- Extract core principles and translate them into a 5–7 step framework.",
    "- Define inputs, steps, and decision criteria tailored to {{decision_type}}.",
    "- Add safeguards: bias checks, reversibility, and monitoring hooks.",
    "",
    "## Execution Flow",
    "1) Summarize key principles.",
    "2) Draft step-by-step framework with inputs/outputs per step.",

    "4) Provide example application.",
    "5) Run quality checks and refine.",
