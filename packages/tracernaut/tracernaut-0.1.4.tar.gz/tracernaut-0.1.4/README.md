## ðŸš€ What is Tracernaut?

**Tracernaut** is a pedagogical tool that captures and **visually traces the execution** of Python code â€” including variable states, memory references, object relationships, and the call stack â€” using rich, annotated diagrams.

It turns abstract Python behavior into something **visible**, **intuitive**, and **beautifully structured**.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Example

```python
from tracernaut import tracernaut

@tracernaut
def example():
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = {'x': a, 'y': 4}
    a.append(5)
    return b

example()
```

This opens an interactive widget (in Jupyter) that lets you step through each line and visualize changes in memory, objects, variables, and control flow.
