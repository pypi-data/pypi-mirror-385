# Gene Research Template

Please provide a comprehensive research report on the gene {gene} in {organism}.

## Research Focus Areas

I need detailed information covering:

1. **Gene Function and Molecular Mechanisms**
   - Primary molecular function(s)
   - Biochemical activities and enzymatic properties
   - Protein domains and structural features
   - Molecular interactions and binding partners

2. **Cellular Localization and Components**
   - Subcellular localization
   - Cellular compartments where the gene product is active
   - Transport mechanisms and targeting signals

3. **Biological Processes**
   - Key biological pathways involved
   - Developmental processes
   - Physiological roles
   - Metabolic functions

4. **Disease Associations and Phenotypes**
   - Known disease associations
   - Mutation effects and pathology
   - Clinical relevance
   - Therapeutic targets

5. **Expression and Regulation**
   - Tissue-specific expression patterns
   - Developmental stage expression
   - Regulatory mechanisms (transcriptional, post-transcriptional)
   - Environmental responses

6. **Evolutionary Conservation**
   - Phylogenetic distribution
   - Orthologous genes in other species
   - Evolutionary significance

7. **Experimental Evidence**
   - Key experimental studies
   - Functional characterization methods
   - Recent research developments

## Output Requirements

- Provide specific citations for all major claims
- Include relevant Gene Ontology (GO) terms where applicable
- Focus on experimental evidence over computational predictions
- Highlight recent discoveries (last 5 years) where relevant
- Include protein identifiers (UniProt IDs) when available
