This module customizes the website shop page so that portal users only
see products that are explicitly included in their assigned pricelist.
It ensures personalized product visibility per customer without
affecting internal users or public visitors.

Usage

   restrict product visibility for all portal users by going to Website
   > Configuration > Settings and selecting the checkbox "Restrict
   Products For All Users".
4. Log in as that contact (portal user).
