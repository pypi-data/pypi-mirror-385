    """
    Several API fields are optional but do not accept blank or empty values.
    This function returns a dict to use with update() to construct an API payload.
    If the field value matches any value in drop_if[], it returns {}, so update() has no effect,
    and the field is not included.

    Parameters
    ----------
    field_name: name of the field. Snake case is OK; this function camelizes
    field_value: value of the field. Enums are converted to strings.
    if_matches: if value matches any in this list, exclude the field. Default is ["", {}, None].

    To intentionally include a null or blank value in the payload, modify drop_if.

    Returns
    -------
    a dict of the value (possibly empty) to update the payload with
