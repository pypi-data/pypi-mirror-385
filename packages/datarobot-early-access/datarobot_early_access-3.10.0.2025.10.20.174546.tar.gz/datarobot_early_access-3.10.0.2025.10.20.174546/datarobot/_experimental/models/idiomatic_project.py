    This class is an enhancement of the Project class. It has additional methods that are intended
    to work similarly to sklearn analogs, and bundle several existing smaller methods:
        - IdiomaticProject.fit : "fit" your project, by (re-)running Autopilot

        (yet to come in future PRs)
        - IdiomaticProject.predict : "predict" using your project's recommended model
        - IdiomaticProject.deploy : make a deployment from your project's recommended model

    This class is still in development and behavior may change! When it becomes GA, its methods will
    be moved to the regular Project class.

        Fit the existing project.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mode : Optional[str]
            You can use ``AUTOPILOT_MODE`` enum to choose between

            * ``AUTOPILOT_MODE.FULL_AUTO``
            * ``AUTOPILOT_MODE.MANUAL``
            * ``AUTOPILOT_MODE.QUICK``
            * ``AUTOPILOT_MODE.COMPREHENSIVE``: Runs all blueprints in the repository (warning:
              this may be extremely slow).

            If unspecified, ``QUICK`` is used. If the ``MANUAL`` value is used, the model
            creation process will need to be started by executing the ``start_autopilot``
            function with the desired featurelist. It will start immediately otherwise.
        metric : Optional[str]
            Name of the metric to use for evaluating models. You can query
            the metrics available for the target by way of
            ``Project.get_metrics``. If none is specified, then the default
            recommended by DataRobot is used.
        feature_list : str or list of Optional[str]
            Specifies which feature list to use. If type is str,
            can be either a feature list id or name.
            If a list of str, a dynamic feature list
            will be created with the features named in the list.
        partitioning_method : PartitioningMethod object, optional
            Instance of one of the :ref:`Partition Classes <partitions-api>` defined in
            ``datarobot.helpers.partitioning_methods``.
        advanced_options : AdvancedOptions object, optional
            Used to set advanced options of project creation.
        max_wait : Optional[int]
            Time in seconds after which fitting is considered unsuccessful.

        Returns
        -------
        project : Project
            The instance with updated attributes.

        Raises
        ------
        AsyncFailureError
            Polling for status of async process resulted in response
            with unsupported status code
        AsyncProcessUnsuccessfulError
            Raised if target setting was unsuccessful
        AsyncTimeoutError
            Raised if target setting took more time, than specified
            by ``max_wait`` parameter
        TypeError
            Raised if ``advanced_options`` or ``partitioning_method`` are
            provided and not the correct types.
