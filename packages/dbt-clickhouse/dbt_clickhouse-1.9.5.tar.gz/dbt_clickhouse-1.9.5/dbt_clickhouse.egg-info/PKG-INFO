# dbt-clickhouse

This plugin ports [dbt](https://getdbt.com) functionality to [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.tech/).

## Documentation

See the [ClickHouse website](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/dbt) for the full documentation entry.

## Installation

Use your favorite Python package manager to install the app from PyPI, e.g.

```bash
pip install dbt-core dbt-clickhouse
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Beginning in v1.8, dbt-core and adapters are decoupled. Therefore, the installation mentioned above
> explicitly includes both dbt-core and the desired adapter.If you use a version prior to 1.8.0 the pip installation
> command should look like this:

```bash
pip install dbt-clickhouse
```
