My journey away from violent extremism began 22 years ago, when I denounced racism and left the American white supremacist skinhead movement that I had helped build.
﻿我走出暴力极端主义的旅程 开始于 22 年前， 当我公然谴责了种族主义 并离开了我曾经协助建立的 美国白人至上光头党。
(Cheers and applause)
（欢呼与掌声）
I was just 22 years old at the time, but I had already spent eight years, from the time I was 14 years old, as one of the earliest and youngest members and an eventual leader within America's most violent hate movement.
当时我只有 22 岁， 但是我已经花了 8 年， 从我 14 岁开始， 成为了最早、最年轻的成员之一， 最后还成为了美国最暴力的 仇恨运动的领导人。
But I wasn't born into hate; in fact, it was quite the opposite. I had a relatively normal childhood. My parents are Italian immigrants who came to the United States in the mid-1960s and settled on the South Side of Chicago, where they eventually met, and opened a small beauty shop. Right after I was born, things got a little bit more difficult. They struggled to survive with raising a young family and a new business, often working seven days a week, 14 hours a day, taking on second and third jobs just to earn a meager living. And quality time with my parents was pretty nonexistent. Even though I knew they loved me very much, growing up, I felt abandoned. I was lonely, and I started to withdraw, and then I started to resent my parents and become very angry. And as I was growing up, through my teenage years, I started to act out to try and get attention from my parents.
但我并不是生于仇恨； 事实正好相反。 我的童年还算挺正常的。 我的父母是意大利移民， 在 1960 年代中期来到的美国， 在芝加哥的南城安顿了下来。 他们在那里相识， 并开了一家小型美容店。 我出生以后没多久， 生活就变得更困难一些。 他们艰难地生活着， 要养活一个年轻的家庭和生意， 常常一周要工作 7 天， 一天 14 个小时， 还要兼职多份工作 只为赚取一点微薄的生活费。 和父母相处的宝贵时光 基本是不存在的。 虽然我知道他们非常爱我， 但成长的过程中， 我觉得我被抛弃了。 我很孤独，我开始远离一切。 接着，我开始憎恨我的父母， 我变得很愤怒。 我慢慢长大，在青春期， 我开始做出格的事 以试图得到我父母的注意力。
And one day, when I was 14, I was standing in an alley, and I was smoking a joint, and a man who was twice my age, with a shaved head and tall black boots, came up to me, and he snatched the joint from my lips. Then he put his hand on my shoulder and he looked me in the eyes, and he said, "That's what the communists and the Jews want you to do to keep you docile." I was 14 years old, I'd been trading baseball cards and watching "Happy Days" -- I didn't really know what a Jew was.
有一天，我 14 岁时， 我正站在一个小巷里，吸着大麻， 一名光头男子，年纪有我的两倍， 穿着黑色长靴， 走到了我面前， 从我的唇边夺走了大麻。 然后他把手放到了我的肩上， 看着我的眼睛， 说到： “这正是共产党和犹太人想让你做的， 把你变得容易驯服。” 当时我 14 岁， 我还在交换棒球卡片， 看“欢乐时光”（电视剧）－－ 我并不太知道什么是犹太人。
(Laughter)
（笑）
It's true. And the only communist that I knew was the bad Russian guy in my favorite Rocky movie.
这是真的。 而我唯一知道的共产党员是 在我最喜欢的“洛奇”系列电影中的 俄罗斯反派。
(Laughter)
（笑）
And since I'm here baring my soul with you, I can reveal that I did not even know what the word "docile" meant.
既然我是在这里坦白， 我可以告诉你当时我也不知道 “驯服”这个词是什么意思。
(Laughter)
（笑）
Dead serious.
我是认真的。
But it was as if this man in this alley had offered me a lifeline. For 14 years, I'd felt marginalized and bullied. I had low self-esteem. And frankly, I didn't know who I was, where I belonged, or what my purpose was. I was lost. And overnight, because this man had pulled me in, and I had grabbed onto that lifeline with every fiber of my being. I had gone from "Joanie Loves Chachi" to full-blown Nazi. Overnight.
但那个巷子里的男人 像是给了我一条生命线。 14 年来，我曾感到 被边缘化，被欺负。 我的自尊心很低。 说实话，我并不知道我是谁， 我归属于哪里， 我的人生目的是什么。 我很迷茫。 一夜间，因为这个男人拽了我一把， 我用尽全身抓紧了那条生命线。 我已从“乔安妮爱恰奇“ （电视剧） 走向了彻头彻尾的纳粹。 一夜间。
I started to listen to the rhetoric and believe it. I started to watch very closely as the leaders of this organization would target vulnerable young people who felt marginalized and then draw them in with promises of paradise that were broken. And then I started to recruit myself. I started to do that by making white-power music. And soon, I became the leader of that infamous organization that was led by that man in that alley who recruited me that day, who was America's first neo-Nazi skinhead and who had radicalized me. For the next eight years, I believed the lies that I had been fed. And though I saw no evidence of it whatsoever, I didn't hesitate to blame every Jewish person in the world for what I thought was a white, European genocide being promoted by them through a multiculturalist agenda. I blamed people of color for the crime and violence and the drugs in the city, completely neglecting the fact that I was committing acts of violence on a daily basis, and that in many cases, it was white supremacists who were funneling drugs into the inner cities. And I blamed immigrants for taking jobs from white Americans, completely neglecting the fact that my parents were hardworking immigrants who struggled to survive, despite not getting help from anybody else.
我开始倾听他们的言论， 并相信它。 我开始密切的观察着 这个组织的领导者们， 他们会针对弱势的、 感到自己被边缘化的年轻人， 然后许下自己以后会违背的 天堂般的承诺 来吸引他们。 接着，我自己也开始招募新人。 为了招募人，我开始制作 宣传白人至上的音乐。 不久，我成为了 那个声名狼藉的组织的领导者， 之前的领导人就是那个巷子里 招募了我的男人， 他是美国第一个新纳粹光头党成员， 并极端化了我。 在接下来的八年中， 我相信了那些喂给我的谎言。 尽管我没有看到任何证据， 但我毫不犹豫的责怪了 世界上每一个犹太人， 因为我以为他们在用多文化的事程 推进欧洲白人的种族屠杀。 我怪罪了有色人种， 怪他们造成了城市里的 犯罪、暴力、和毒品， 完全忽视了事实上，我自己也 天天都在犯下暴力行为。 而且在很多时候， 是白人至上主义者 把毒品带到了城市内部。 我怪罪了移民， 怪他们抢走了美国白人的工作， 完全忽视了事实上， 我父母也是辛勤劳作的移民， 需要奋斗以生存， 即使没有任何他人的帮助。
For the next eight years, I saw friends die, I saw others go to prison and inflict untold pain on countless victims and their families' lives. I heard horrific stories from young women in the movement, who'd been brutally raped by the very men they were conditioned to trust, and I myself committed acts of violence against people, solely for the color of their skin, who they loved, or the god that they prayed to. I stockpiled weapons for what I thought was an upcoming race war. I went to six high schools; I was kicked out of four of them, one of them, twice. And 25 years ago, I wrote and performed racist music that found its way to the internet decades later and partially inspired a young white nationalist to walk into a sacred Charleston, South Carolina, church and senselessly massacre nine innocent people.
在接下来的八年里， 我看到了朋友死去， 看到了他人进入监狱 并施加无法形容的痛苦 到无数个受害者 和他们家人的生活。 我从参与运动中年轻的女性 听到过可怕的故事， 她们被自己习惯性信任的男人强奸， 而我自己也对他人犯下了暴力行为， 只因为他们的肤色， 他们爱的人， 或者他们祈祷的神。 我积攒了武器， 为了我以为会到来的种族战争。 我去了六所高中： 我被四所开除， 其中一所被开除了两次。 25 年前，我编写并表演了 种族歧视的音乐。 它十多年后传到了网上， 并部分的启发了 一个年轻的白人民族主义者 走进一个神圣的教堂， 在查尔斯顿，南卡罗来纳州 然后毫无感觉的 屠杀了九个无辜的人。
But then my life changed. At 19 years old, I met a girl who was not in the movement, who didn't have a racist bone in her body, and I fell in love with her. And at 19, we got married, and we had our first son. And when I held my son in my arms in the delivery room that day, not only did I reconnect with some of the innocence that I had lost at 14 years old, but it also began to challenge the very important things that drew me to the movement to begin with: identity, community and purpose -- things that I had been struggling with as a young boy. And now, I struggled with the concept of who I was again. Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger, or was I a caring father and husband? Was my community the one that I had manufactured around me to boost my own ego, because I felt self-hatred for myself and I wanted to project it onto others, or was it the one that I had physically given life to? Was my purpose to scorch the earth or was it to make it a better place for my family? And suddenly, like a ton of bricks hit me, I became very confused with who I'd been for the last eight years. And if only I'd been brave enough to walk away at that moment, to understand what the struggle was that was happening inside of me, then maybe tragedy could have been averted.
但接着，我的人生改变了。 19 岁时，我遇到了一个 不在这个运动中的女孩。 她身体里没有一根种族歧视的骨头。 然后我爱上了她。 19 岁时，我们结了婚， 然后有了我们第一个儿子。 当那天我在产房中 用双手抱起我儿子时， 我不只重新找回了一部分  我 14 岁时丢到的纯真， 我也开始质疑 最一开始把我吸引进 这个运动的重要因素： 身分，集体，和目的－－ 当我还是小男孩时 一直在挣扎的东西。 而现在，我再一次 挣扎于 “ 我是谁 ” 的概念。 我是个煽动仇恨的新纳粹， 还是一个有爱心的父亲和丈夫？ 我的集体是那个我自己捏造出来的、 为了膨胀自我的集体， 因为我曾经恨着自己 并想把这恨意投射到他人身上， 还是那个给了我生命的社会？ 我的目的是把一切变成焦土， 还是让我的家庭活得更好？ 突然间，就像一吨砖块 砸到了我身上， 我变的非常困惑， 不知道过去 8 年的我是谁。 如果当时的我能足够勇敢地走开， 能理解在我内心所发生的斗争， 那悲剧就可能会被避免。
Instead, I did compromise. I took myself off the streets for the benefit of my family, because I was nervous that maybe I could go to jail or end up dead, and they would have to fend for themselves. So I stepped back as a leader, and instead I opened a record store that I was going to sell white-power music in, of course, because I was importing it in from Europe. But I knew that if I was just a racist store selling racist music the community would not allow me to be there. So I decided I was going to also stock the shelves with other music, like punk rock and heavy metal and hip-hop. And while the white-power music that I was selling was 75 percent of my gross revenue, because people were driving in from all over the country to buy it from the only store that was selling it,
但是我选择了妥协。 为了家庭，我离开了街头， 因为担心我可能会进监狱或者死去， 导致我的家人会需要为自己谋生。 所以我从领导者的位置退了一步， 然后开了一家唱片店。 当然，我打算卖 宣传白人至上的音乐， 因为我在从欧洲进口这些唱片。 不过我知道如果只是一个 种族歧视的店家贩卖种族歧视的音乐 社区肯定不会容许我把店开在那里。 所以我决定也在架子上放些其它唱片， 像是朋克摇滚、重金属、 和嘻哈。 虽然我贩卖的白人至上音乐 占到了我总利润的 75 %， 因为人们会从全国各地开车到 这唯一一家卖这种音乐的店，
I also had customers come in to buy the other music. And eventually, they started to talk to me. One day, a young black teen came in, and he was visibly upset. And I decided to ask him what was wrong. And he told me that his mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And suddenly, this young black teenager, who I'd never had a meaningful conversation or interaction with, I was able to connect with, because my own mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and I could feel his pain. On another occasion, a gay couple came in with their son, and it was undeniable to me that they loved their son in the same profound ways that I loved mine. And suddenly, I couldn't rationalize or justify the prejudice that I had in my head.
但我也有顾客来买其它音乐。 久而久之，他们也开始和我交谈。 一天，一个年轻的 黑人青年走了进来， 他看起来就很不开心。 而我决定问问他出了什么事。 他告诉我他的母亲 被诊断为患有乳腺癌。 忽然间，这个黑人青年， 一个我之前从来没有过 任何有意义的交谈或互动的人， 和我产生了联系， 因为我自己的母亲 也被诊断患有乳腺癌， 而我能感受到他的痛苦。 还有一次，一个同性恋情侣 和他们的儿子走了进来， 而我无法否认他们爱着自己的儿子， 就像我深深地爱着我儿子一样。 突然间，我无法再解释或合理化 之前脑海中的偏见。
I decided to pull the white-power music from the inventory when I became too embarrassed to sell it in front of my new friends. And of course, the store couldn't sustain itself, so I had to close it. At that same time, I lost nearly everything in my life. I used it as an opportunity to walk away from the movement that I'd been a part of for eight years, the only identity, community and purpose that I'd really known for most of my life. So I had nobody. I lost my livelihood because I closed the store. I didn't have a great relationship with my parents, even though they tried. And my wife and children left me, because I hadn't left the movement and disengaged quickly enough. And suddenly, I didn't know who I was again, or where I fit in or what my purpose was supposed to be. I was miserable inside, and I often woke up in the morning wishing that I hadn't.
我决定把白人至上的音乐从库存抽走， 因为我觉得在新朋友面前 卖这些音乐太惭愧了。 当然，我的店无法经营下去， 所以我把它关了。 同时，我失去了 生命中几乎所有的东西。 我把它用作一个机会 来离开我曾参与了 8 年的运动： 我大半生唯一知道的 身分、集体、和目的。 我没有任何人。 我丢掉了生计，因为把店关了。 我和父母的关系并不好， 虽然他们有过尝试。 我的妻子和孩子离开了我， 因为我并没有及早离开运动。 突然， 我再一次不知道我是谁， 我归属于哪里， 或者我的目的应该是什么。 我的内心很痛苦， 每天早上醒来时， 我常常希望我没有醒来。
About five years in, one of the few friends that I had was concerned about my well-being, and she came to me and she said, "You need to do something, because I don't want to see you die." And she suggested that I go apply for a job where she worked, at a company called IBM. Yeah, I thought she was crazy, too.
大概五年后， 我少数几个朋友之一 很担忧我的身心健康， 所以她找到了我，然后说： “你必须做点什么， 因为我不想看你死去。” 她建议我去她工作的地方 申请一个职位， 一个叫 IBM 的公司。 是啊，我也以为她疯了。
(Laughter)
（笑）
Here I was, a closeted ex-Nazi covered in hate tattoos. I didn't go to college. I'd been kicked out of multiple high schools multiple times. I didn't even own a computer. But I went in, and somehow, miraculously, I got the job. I was thrilled.
看看我，一个私底下 满身都是关于仇恨的刺青的前纳粹。 我没上过大学。 我曾被不止一所高中 开除过不止一次。 我甚至都没有电脑。 但我走了进去， 不知道这样，奇迹般地， 我得到了一份工作。 我非常激动。
And then I became terrified to learn that they'd actually be putting me back at my old high school, the same one I got kicked out of twice, to install their computers. This was a high school where I had committed acts of violence against students, against faculty; where I had protested out in front of the school for equal rights for whites and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria to try and demand a white student union.
接着，我知道了一件让我惶恐的事： 他们安排我到 我原来的高中， 就是那个把我开除了两次的高中， 去安装他们的电脑。 在这所高中，我曾犯下暴力行为 对学生，对老师； 我曾在学校的门口抗议 来争取白人平权， 我甚至在食堂静坐抗议 来试图取得一个白人学生会。
And of course, as karma would have it, within the first couple of hours, who walks right by me but Mr. Johnny Holmes, the tough black security guard I had gotten in a fistfight with, that got me kicked out the second time and led out in handcuffs from the school. He didn't recognize me, but I saw him, and I didn't know what to do. I was frozen; I was this grown man now, years out of the movement, and I was sweating and I was trembling. But I decided I had to do something. And I decided I needed to suffer under the weight of my past, because for five years I had tried to outrun it. I'd tried to make new friends and cover my tattoos with long sleeves, and I wouldn't admit it because I was afraid of being judged the same way I had judged other people. Well, I decided I was going to chase Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot -- probably not the smartest decision that I made.
不出所料，按着命运的因果报应， 就在我进学校的前几个小时， 走过我身边的 是Johnny Holmes先生， 我曾经打过架的强悍黑人保安。 这事导致我第二次被开除， 我还戴着手铐离开了学校。 他没有认出来我， 但是我看见了他， 而我不知道该做什么。 我僵在了那里；我是一个成年人的， 离开了运动很多年了， 而我当时满身是汗，全身发抖。 但我决定必须做点什么。 我决定我需要背负过去的重量， 为它遭受痛苦， 因为五年来我一直试图避开它。 我曾尝试交新的朋友， 用长袖衣服遮住我的刺青， 而我不敢承认， 因为我害怕被评判， 就像我当初评判他人一样。 于是，我决定去追霍姆斯先生 一直到停车场－－ 大概不是我做过的最聪明的决定。
(Laughter)
（笑）
But when I found him, he was getting into his car, and I tapped him on the shoulder. And when he turned around and he recognized me, he took a step back because he was afraid. And I didn't know what to say. Finally, the words came out of my mouth, and all I could think to say was, "I'm sorry." And he embraced me, and he forgave me. And he encouraged me to forgive myself. He recognized that it wasn't the story of some broken go-nowhere kid who was going to just join a gang and go to prison. He knew that this was the story of every young person who was vulnerable, who was searching for identity, community and purpose, and then hit a wall and was unable to find it and went down a dark path. And he made me promise one thing, that I would tell my story to whoever would listen. That was 18 years ago, and I've been doing it ever since.
当我找到他的时候， 他正要上车， 于是我拍了下他的肩膀。 当他转过身来并认出我时， 他因为恐惧往后退了一步。 而我不知道该说什么。 终于，字句从我的嘴中脱出， 而所有我能想说的是： “我很抱歉。” 然后他拥抱了我， 并原谅了我。 他还鼓励我原谅自己。 他看出了这不只是一个破碎的、 一无所成的孩子的故事， 一个只会加入黑帮、蹲监狱的人。 他知道这是每一个 容易受伤的年轻人的故事， 他们在寻找自己的 身分、集体、和目标， 碰壁了， 找不回来了， 然后走上了黑暗的道路。 他让我承诺了一件事： 我要把我的故事 讲给任何一个想听的人。 这是 18 年前， 从那时起我就一直在做。
(Applause)
（掌声）
You might be asking yourself right now: How does a good kid from a hardworking immigrant family end up going down such a dark path? One word: potholes. That's right. Potholes. I had a lot of potholes when I was kid. We all had them -- you know, the things in life that we hit that invariably just kind of nudge us off our path, and if they remain unresolved or untreated or not dealt with, sometimes we can get dangerously lost down pretty dark corridors. Potholes can be things like trauma, abuse, unemployment, neglect, untreated mental health conditions, even privilege. And if we hit enough potholes on our journey in life, and we don't have the resources or the help to navigate around them or to pull us out, well, sometimes good people end up doing bad things.
你现在可能会问自己： 一个从勤劳工作的 移民家庭来的好孩子 是怎么走下了这么一条黑暗的道路？ 一个词：凹洞。 没错，凹洞。 我小时候有着很多凹洞。 我们都曾有过－－ 你知道的，我们人生中撞到的东西 无可避免的把我们 轻轻推离自己的道路， 而如果它们一直没被解决， 没被治愈， 没被处理， 我们有时会危险地 走丢到黑暗的角落。 凹洞可以是创伤、 虐待、失业、 忽视、 没被治疗的心理疾病、 甚至特权。 而如果我们在人生的旅途上 碰到了很多凹洞， 并且没有资源或者协助 来帮我们绕开它们 或把我们拉出来， 有的时候好人也会做出坏事。
One such person who had potholes is Darrell. Darrell is from upstate New York. He had read my memoir, and he was really upset about the ending. You see, I'd gotten out of the movement and he was still in. And he emailed me and he said, "I didn't really like the way that turned out." And I said, "Well, I'm sorry."
其中一个有凹洞的人是Darrell。 达雷尔来自纽约州北部。 他读过我的回忆录， 对结局感到非常失望。 你看，我已经离开了运动， 而他还在其中。 于是他发了封电子邮件给我，说： “我不是很喜欢最后结局的发展。” 然后我说，“喔，我很抱歉。”
(Laughter)
（笑）
"But if you want to talk about it, we could certainly do that."
“但是如果你想聊聊， 我们当然可以。”
And after a couple of weeks of going back and forth with Darrell, I learned he was a 31-year-old military veteran who had been injured and was really angry about not being able to go to Afghanistan to kill Muslims. And one day on the phone, he told me that he had seen a Muslim man in the park praying, and that all he wanted to do was kick him in the face. I flew to Buffalo the next day, and I sat down with Darrell, and I asked him, "Have you ever met a Muslim person before?" And he said, "No! Why the hell would I want to do that? They're evil. I don't want anything to do with them." I said, "OK." So I excused myself, and I went into the bathroom and I took my phone out in the bathroom, and I Googled the local mosque, and I called them very quietly from the bathroom, and I said, "Excuse me, imam, I need a favor. I have a Christian man who would really love to learn more about your religion."
和Darrell来往回信的几周中， 我了解到他是一个 31 岁的 因伤退役的军人， 他很气愤自己不能 去阿富汗杀穆斯林。 一天，在电话上， 他告诉我他看到了 一个穆斯林男子在公园祈祷， 而他唯一想做的 是一脚踢到他的脸上。 第二天，我飞到了水牛城， 和Darrell坐下来谈， 然后我问他： “你曾认识过任何一个穆斯林吗？” 他说，“没有！ 我为什么见鬼了要这么做？ 他们是邪恶的。 我不想和他们扯上任何关系。” 我说，“ 好吧。” 于是我走进了洗手间， 拿出了我的手机， 谷歌搜索了当地的清真寺， 然后我在从洗手间 很小声地打电话给他们， 我说：“不好意思， 伊玛目 ［领袖］，我需要帮忙。 我这有一个基督教徒 非常想了解你们的宗教。”
(Laughter)
（笑）
"Do you mind if we stop by?"
“你会介意我们去拜访吗？”
Well, it took some convincing for Darrell to go, but finally we got there, and when I knocked on the door, the imam said he only had 15 minutes left for us, because he was preparing for a prayer service. I said, "We'll take it." We went in, and two and a half hours later, we came out after hugging and crying and, very strangely, bonding over Chuck Norris for some reason.
我花了不少功夫来说服Darrell， 不过最终我们到了那里。 我敲了敲门， 伊玛目说他只有 15 分钟留给我们， 因为他需要准备祷告。 我说，“ 没问题。” 我们走了进去， 两个半小时后， 我们已经历了泪水和拥抱， 很奇怪的，我们还因为查克·诺里斯 拉近了距离。［动作片演员］
(Laughter)
我不知道那是怎么回事， 但它就是发生了。 现在我可以很开心的说， 你经常能看到 达雷尔和伊玛目在当地的 中东小吃摊一起吃午饭。
I don't know what it was about that, but that's what happened. And I'm happy to say now that Darrell and the imam, you can often find them at the local falafel stand, having lunch together.
（掌声）
(Applause)
你可以看出， 问题是人们缺乏联系。 仇恨来源于无知。 恐惧是其父，孤立是其母。 当我们不理解一个东西时， 我们常常会害怕它， 而如果我们让自己远离它， 这恐惧会加大，有时会变成仇恨。 自从离开运动，我已经 帮助了超过一百个人 脱离极端主义运动， 白人至上群体－－
You see, it's our disconnection from each other. Hatred is born of ignorance. Fear is its father, and isolation is its mother. When we don't understand something, we tend to be afraid of it, and if we keep ourselves from it, that fear grows, and sometimes, it turns into hatred. Since I've left the movement, I've helped over a hundred people disengage from extremist movements, from white supremacist groups --
（掌声）
(Applause)
甚至是伊斯兰圣战主义者。 我的做法并不是和他们争吵， 不是和他们辩论， 甚至不是跟他们说 他们哪里错了， 尽管有时，天哪，我真的很想。 但我不这么做。 相反，我不会把他们推开， 而是把他们拉近， 认真倾听他们的凹洞， 然后开始把他们填满。 我试着让人们变得更有韧性， 更自信， 更有能力学习技能以在市场竞争， 这样他们就不必责怪其他人， 他们自己从来没见过的其他人。
to even jihadist groups. And the way I do that is not by arguing with them, not by debating them, not by even telling them they're wrong, even though, boy, I want to sometimes. I don't do that. Instead, I don't push them away. I draw them in closer, and I listen very closely for their potholes, and then I begin to fill them in. I try to make people more resilient, more self-confident, more able to have skills to compete in the marketplace so that they don't have to blame the other, the other that they've never met.
在我走之前， 我想再留下最后一个想法。 所有我曾经帮助过的人 都会告诉你同样的东西。 第一，他们成为极端主义者的原因 是因为他们想有所归属， 而不是因为什么理论或教义。 第二，把他们带出困境的 是得到同情， 从最不该同情他们的人， 在他们最不配同情的时候。
I'd like to just leave you with one last thing before I go. Of all the people I've worked with, they will all tell you the same thing. One, they became extremists because they wanted to belong, not because of ideology or dogma. And second, what brought them out was receiving compassion from the people they least deserved it from, when they least deserved it.
（掌声）
(Applause)
所以我想留给各位一个挑战： 走出去， 今天、明天、最好每天 找到一个你认为不值得你同情的人 然后给他们同情。 因为我保证， 他们是最需要你的同情心的人。
So I would like to leave you with a challenge: go out there today, tomorrow -- hopefully every day -- find somebody that you think is undeserving of your compassion and give it to them, because I guarantee you, they're the ones who need it the most.
谢谢！
Thank you very much.
