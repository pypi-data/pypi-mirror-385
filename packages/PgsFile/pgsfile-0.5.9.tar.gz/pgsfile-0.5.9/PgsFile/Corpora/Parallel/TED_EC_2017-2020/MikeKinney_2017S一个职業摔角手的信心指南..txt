Picture it: a big, sweaty, tattooed man in a cowboy hat and chaps, is in the ring as the arena full of fans cheer him on. Their hero: "Cowboy" Gator Magraw. Gator bounces off the ropes and is quickly body-slammed to the mat. His wild opponent leaps into the air, crashing down onto Gator's rib cage. Gator struggles to breathe, wondering: "Is this really what my father wanted for me?"
﻿想象一下， 一个有刺青、满身大汗的壮汉， 戴着一顶牛仔帽，穿着一条皮裤， 站在擂台上， 赛场上充满了粉丝的欢呼。 他们的英雄： “牛仔”——鳄鱼麦格劳。 盖特从绳子上跳下， 然后快速地摔在垫子上。 他狂野的对手一跃而起， 撞向盖特的肋骨。 盖特挣扎着呼吸，然后想： “这真的是我父亲想要我做的吗？”
(Laughter)
（笑声）
That wild man in the chaps ... was me.
那个穿着皮裤的狂野男人…… 是我。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
(Applause)
（掌声）
(Cheers)
（欢呼）
And the answer to the question, surprisingly, is yes.
出乎意料地，刚刚那个答案， 是肯定的。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
I grew up watching professional wrestling with my dad. And like him, I loved everything about it: the showmanship, the athletic skill, the drama. I'd be this little boy, bouncing all over our living room, pretending to be my favorite wrestlers from TV. My dad actually reminded me a little bit of Hulk Hogan, but I was Hulk Hogan and he was Andre the Giant. I'd get all serious on him and say things like, "Dad ... someday I am going to be world heavyweight champion." And he would usually smile and very calmly say, "OK, then I guess I can count on you to be my retirement fund."
我是和我父亲一起看着职业摔跤比赛 长大的。 和他一样，我钟爱摔跤的一切： 表现力，运动技巧， 紧张刺激的比赛气氛。 我还是小男孩时，就喜欢 在客厅里蹦来蹦去， 假装我是自己最喜欢的摔跤手。
(Laughter)
我父亲有点儿像浩克霍根 但我是浩克霍根，他是巨人安德烈。
When I was 16, a small wrestling show came to my little town in Minnesota. I couldn't believe it. Nothing like that had ever come to my town before. So I got to the arena early in the morning the day of the show, waiting out in the parking lot to see if I could spot some wrestlers pulling up in their cars. It wasn't as creepy as it sounds. But I could definitely tell who the wrestlers were, just the way they walked. They were tall and confident and intimidating, with their tank tops and Zubaz and fanny packs. Why wouldn't I want to be them?
我会认真地对他说，
(Laughter)
“爸爸，总有一天 我会成为世界重量级冠军。” 他通常会微笑然后平静地说， “好啊，那我退休后 就靠你赚钱养我了。”
All I could think about was who are these people, and what are they like? How did they become wrestlers? So before the show started, I walked into this tiny arena -- more like a gymnasium -- and I asked them if I could help set up the wrestling ring. "Sure, kid. No problem." And then I pleaded with them to show me some wrestling moves. "Sure, kid. No problem." Man, they would just punch and kick me -- hard! But I never complained. They would come to my town for one night every couple of months that year, and then -- poof! -- next day, they were gone.
（笑声）
By the next year, they finally told me about an actual wrestling training camp that one of the wrestlers was running, and I begged my parents to sign me up. Next thing I knew, I was a high school senior by day and wrestling in front of live audiences by night. I had this giant poster of an alligator hanging on my bedroom wall. So when I needed to come up with a wrestling name at the last minute and Jesse "The Body" Ventura was already taken --
16岁那年， 在明尼苏达州，家乡小镇上 迎来了一场小型摔跤秀。 我简直不敢相信。 那样的事情在之前从未发生过。 表演当天的清晨我就到了竞技场， 在停车场外等着， 看能否发现一些摔跤手 来停车场停车。 实际上没有听起来的这么怪异。 但我可以认出谁是摔跤手， 看看他们走路的方式就知道了。 他们高大自信，气场强大， 穿着背心和花裤子，还戴着腰包。 我难道不想成为他们的一员吗？ （笑声） 我想，这些人是谁呢？
(Laughter)
他们是什么样的人？ 他们是如何成为摔跤手的？ 所以在表演开始前， 我走进这个小型竞技场—— 更像是一个体育馆—— 我问他们我可以帮忙搭建擂台吗。 “当然了孩子，没问题。” 然后我请求他们 向我展示一些摔跤动作， “当然了孩子，没问题。”
I went with "Gator." I also wrestled in a t-shirt and camouflage pants because that's what I had in my closet. I hadn't quite figured out how to develop my own persona yet, but I was learning. It was sort of like an apprenticeship. But I was a wrestler. And my dad would come to all my matches wearing a t-shirt that said, "Papa Gator" across the front.
他们用拳击打我然后猛踢我， 但我没有抱怨。
(Laughter)
那一年每隔几个月， 他们就会到我们小镇住一晚， 然后第二天就离开了。 第二年的时候， 他们终于告诉我， 一个真正的摔跤训练营 是其中一个摔跤手开的。 我求父母让我报名， 然后我就白天去读高三， 晚上在观众面前摔跤。 我卧室墙壁上贴了一张 短吻鳄的巨型海报， 所以当我急着 想出一个摔跤名时，
And he'd brag to his friends about how his son was going to pay for his retirement someday.
而“肌体”杰西·范图拉已经被占用了—— （笑声） 我选择了“鳄鱼”。 我穿着T恤和迷彩裤摔跤 因为我的衣橱里只有这些，
(Laughter)
我还没想好如何 发展自己的风格， 但我在学习。 我那时有点儿像学徒， 但我是一个摔跤手。 我的每场比赛父亲都会来， 穿着一件胸前印着 “鳄鱼爸爸”的T恤。 （笑声） 他会和他的朋友吹牛， 说我以后会为他养老。 （笑声） 我本可以的。 但我开始摔跤后的不久， 父亲意外去世了。 你们可以想象， 我当时还是个青涩少年， 丧父之痛击垮了我。 如果你们曾经失去过亲人， 就会知道那段时间有多难。 你的大脑无法正常运转， 整件事都是离奇的。 我想回归正常生活， 哪怕只有一秒钟， 所以我几乎是立刻重返擂台。 你们知道吗？ 摔跤属于我和我父亲。 所以我回到那里， 坐在更衣室里准备比赛， 而我父亲才去世没几天。 他过世了。 我一个人坐在那儿， 好像在逃避什么， 但我又感觉应该在那儿。 一个久经赛场的摔跤手 知道了我的遭遇， 便来看看我是否还好。 我说不出话， 只说“我不知道我在做什么。” 然后我们就静静地坐在那里， 相对无言。 在准备起身去比赛之前， 他给了我一条建议， 完全改变了我的人生方向： 他说最好的摔跤手展现真我。 成功的摔跤手能发掘自身 最强的特质， 并使他们成为擂台的焦点。 我坐在那儿， 一个彷徨的青年， 迷失了自我， 忘记了摔跤的意义。 我环顾着更衣室的其它摔跤手， 然后想， “我看上去像个异类 我怎么做才能像他们一样？” 然后我突然想到。 那一刻我意识到我没必要成为他们。 我只需要知道 做我自己意味着什么， 是什么使我与众不同， 我如何让我的特质成为我的优势。 我知道自己不像其他运动员 那样肌肉健硕， 但我也不在乎这个。 我想到的第一件事是， “我如何加强一些简单的事物 比如令我的身体舒适？” 我不知道。 然后我想到： 泳裤。
And I would've.
（笑声）
Not long after I started wrestling, my dad unexpectedly passed away. And as you can imagine, especially as a teenage boy, it destroyed me. If you've ever lost someone, you know what a difficult time that can be. Your mind -- it's not working right. The whole thing is just so surreal. I wanted to feel normal again, even if it was for just a second, so I went back to wrestling almost immediately. Wrestling belonged to me and my dad, you know? So there I was, sitting in the locker room, getting ready for a match within days of my dad passing away. He was gone. And sitting there alone -- it felt like I was hiding. But it also felt like I needed to be there.
（掌声）
One of the wrestlers who'd been on the scene a long time knew what I was going through, and he came over to see how I was holding up. I couldn't get the words out. I just said, "I don't know what I'm doing." And then we just sat there in silence -- just ... silence. Before he got up to get ready for his own match, he gave me this piece of advice that would change the entire direction of my life. He told me the best wrestlers are just themselves, but "turned up." He said successful wrestlers find the traits within themselves they're the strongest at and make those the focus of who they become in the ring.
或者“紧身短裤”， 我们在摔跤中这么称呼它们。 紧身短裤， 我可能是这个大家伙， 舒服地穿着这一小条紧身短裤 在一群陌生人面前。 所以我放弃了T恤和迷彩裤。 于是鳄鱼的新衣橱诞生了。
So there I sat -- a scared teenager who didn't know who he was or why he was even wrestling anymore. I looked around the locker room at some of the other wrestlers, and I thought, "I look so different. How can I ever be like them?" And then it hit me. That's the moment I realized I didn't have to be like them. What I did have to do was find out: What did it mean to be me? What made me unique, and how could I use it to my advantage? I knew I wasn't a chiseled athlete like some of these guys, but I really didn't care. So the first thing I thought was, "How can I amplify something as simple as: comfortable with my own body?" I didn't know. And then I thought: Speedo.
（笑声）
(Laughter)
我擅长画卡通画， 我想我能否把这点展现出来。 我可以设计自己的摔跤服， 这样每条短裤上 都会有独特的设计和颜色。 每条都不一样—— 同时非常舒适。
(Applause)
（笑声）
Or "trunks," as we call them in wrestling. Yeah, trunks. I could be this big guy who was comfortable wearing these little trunks in front of a bunch of strangers. So I ditched the t-shirt and camouflage pants, and Gator's new wardrobe was born.
我在学校也很有趣， 信不信由你们。 我想也许我可以把这一点展现出来。
(Laughter)
或许我能从一个令人发笑的男孩，
I was also pretty good at drawing cartoons, so I wondered if I could turn that up. I could design my own wrestling costumes, so each pair of trunks would have its own unique design and color, all of them completely different -- and extremely comfortable, by the way.
变成能振奋上万人的人。 所以我坚定了这个想法， 我没必要令人胆寒， 像某些选手那样。 我以搞笑的方式走入竞技场。 经历了更多的摔跤赛， 我更加了解自己。 我发现我可以自嘲， 在出场音乐响起时可以载歌载舞， 一路来到擂台， 顺便说一下，那是跳舞。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
And I was also the funny kid in school, believe it or not. So I thought maybe I could turn that up. Maybe I could go from the boy who made his buddies laugh to the man who could rally hundreds or thousands. So I committed to the idea that my character wasn't going to be as scary as some of the others. I'd be hilarious from the moment I walked into the arena. With every wrestling match, I dug deeper. I found out that I could laugh at myself. So this guy would dance and sing his entrance music all the way to the ring. That was dancing, by the way.
我发现我是一个还不错的摔跤手， 但更是一个搞笑的人。 展现自我使我的粉丝对我印象深刻。 我尝试着去发掘自我—— 那些简单的特质， 然后问自己， 我可以把它们展现出来吗？
(Laughter)
如今我明白 ，我想成为 像父亲一样的男中豪杰。 我想 ，“要做一个男中豪杰， 比牛仔更重要的是什么？”
I found out that I was an OK wrestler, but I was an even better entertainer. And turning myself up made me unforgettable to the fans. I was trying to find those things about me -- the simple things that were special, and then ask, "How can I turn them up?"
那是鳄鱼成为“牛仔”的时候。
Now, I knew I wanted my character to be a man's man like my dad was. I thought, "What's more of a man's man than a cowboy?" And that's when Gator became "Cowboy" ... Gator ... Yeah, I needed a last name. I thought about it until my head hurt. I couldn't come up with anything. I'm sitting there watching TV one night, flipping through the channels, and this commercial comes on about a country singer who had just won an Entertainer of the Year award. Tim McGraw. He's a cool cowboy with a great last name. And I liked his music. It was just all part of my process. But I just kept turning myself up until I became Cowboy Gator Magraw!
是的，我需要一个姓。 我想到头疼也想不出结果。 有一天晚上我坐着 看电视，切换着频道， 看到了一则广告， 关于一个刚刚赢得 年度最佳艺人奖的乡村歌手。 蒂姆·麦格罗。 他是一个有着 很棒姓氏的帅气牛仔， 我喜欢他的歌。
(Laughter)
这是我经历的所有内容。 我不断展现自我， 直到我成为了牛仔“鳄鱼”麦格劳。 （笑声） （掌声）
(Applause)
我知道如果我不断展现自我， 不断自我鞭策， 机会自会降临， 结果确实如此。 一天午夜， 我接到一个电话。 一个我希望父亲能听到的电话。 WWE， 世界上最大的摔跤组织， 邀请我周一晚上出演。 是的——我的所有努力终于有所回报。
And I knew that if I kept turning myself up and pushing myself harder, the opportunities would come. And then it finally happened. In the middle of the night, I got a phone call. It was the call I wish my dad was around to hear. The WWE, the biggest wrestling organization in the world, wanted me to come and be a part of Monday Night Raw. Yes -- all of my hard work and miles on the road were finally paying off. I got to walk down the WWE Raw entrance ramp on live television --
我从 WWE 的入口匝道 走到电视直播的舞台上—— （笑声） 装扮成一名保安—— （笑声） 护送另一位摔跤手到擂台上。 （笑声） 当然 ，我为自己没能登台感到失望， 但是鲜有摔跤手得到 WWE 的邀请， 大概几百人中才有一个。 而我来到 WWE， 就是因为 牛仔“鳄鱼”麦格劳。 所以那天我没有选择离开， 而是选择展现自我， 尽最大的努力 当好一个安保人员。 事实上我做到了， 我是那天唯一一个 获得特写镜头的保安。 那也很了不起了，好吗？ （笑声） 那一整天我坐在后台， 身边是一些世界顶级摔跤手， 有的是我童年的偶像， 我有机会听取他们的建议并学习。 那天， 我和他们打成一片。 也许我的 WWE 经历不是那么美好， 我的意思是我没有登上擂台， 但那使我更努力地工作。 年复一年，我愈发强大， 我在擂台上的表现胜过以往， 而且其他人注意到了。
(Laughter)
在我意识到之前， 我从明尼苏达每月一次的摔跤， 进展到在全美范围内每周四次 在独立摔跤巡回中比赛。 我在实现我的梦想。 在经历了几年的摔跤生涯之后， 我肩膀受了很严重的伤。 那时我和妻子， 正好迎来了我们第一个孩子。 我知道你们在想什么， 但是这两件事没有关联。 （笑声） 我需要进行肩部手术， 我想回家和家人待在一起。 现在轮到我当父亲了。 于是2007年7月27日， 我最后一次比赛， 然后退役， 开启了人生的下一个篇章。 随着时光的流逝， 最奇异的事情发生了。 我发现人的开关一旦被打开后， 就很难再被关上。 虽然我离开了擂台， 但是“鳄鱼”与我同在， 我将自我展现运用到日常生活中去。 这个过程中我的娇妻一直陪伴着我， 尽管她不喜欢职业摔跤手， （笑声） 一点也不。
dressed up as a fake security guard --
但她是我的头号粉丝， 现在也是。 她知道鳄鱼麦格劳不会消失， 她希望我们的女儿和双胞胎儿子 也能发现自我， 就像我一样， 但是少挨几次泰山压顶 或者钢椅砸头。 你们知道有多少次 她不得不提醒我 不要在孩子的足球比赛上 对裁判动粗？ （笑声） 其实只有过一次， 但那是有人对我女儿恶意犯规！ （笑声）
(Laughter)
如今作为一位父亲， 我逐渐明白我父亲想要的 远不是退休金。 就像大部分的父母一样， 他只希望我能发挥最大的潜能。 我想告诉我的孩子们，
to escort another wrestler to the ring.
展现自我不仅是 成就伟大的秘诀， 更是一种生活方式。 时刻发掘你的特质， 并发扬光大，让世人看到。 顺便提一句，我的孩子们 也不喜欢摔跤。 （笑声） 但我觉得没什么问题， 因为他们有自己的特质， 就像我们所有人一样。 我的一个儿子热爱电子元件， 也许帮助他展现自我， 可以成就下一个史蒂夫·乔布斯。 另一个儿子还有我的女儿 他们擅长艺术， 也许帮助他们提升才能， 可以成就下一个毕加索。 你永远不知道自己的潜力， 直到你去挖掘。 不要害怕那么做， 看看四周， 有人说如果你在观众面前感到紧张， 就想象他们只穿着内衣。 但我转念一想，“嘿， 我摔跤的时候穿的更少。” （笑声）
(Laughter)
（掌声）
Sure, I was disappointed I didn't get to wrestle, but very few wrestlers get any kind of call from the WWE. Maybe one in a few hundred. And becoming Cowboy Gator Magraw is what got me there. So instead of walking away that day, I decided to turn myself up again and become the best security guard I could. In fact, I did it so well, I was the only guard to get a close-up on TV that night. That's a big deal, you know?
你看，你不需要等到 摔跤巡回来到你家镇上 就能得到展现真我的机会。 成为一个更强大，更耀眼的自己。 它未必来自我们的父母。 发掘自我意味着你要找到真我，
(Laughter)
然后对自己说， “或许，仅是或许， 我比自己想象得更强大。”
And I got to sit backstage that entire day with some of the most famous pro wrestlers in the world, some of which were heroes of mine as a kid. And I got to listen to them and learn from them, and for that day, I was accepted as one of them.
谢谢。
Maybe my experience with the WWE wasn't ideal. I mean, I didn't get to wrestle. But it made me work harder, turning myself up louder year after year. I was becoming the biggest version of myself in the ring, and other people took notice. Before I knew it, I'd gone from wrestling maybe once a month in Minnesota to as often as four times a week all over the United States on the independent wrestling circuit. I was literally living my dream.
（掌声）
