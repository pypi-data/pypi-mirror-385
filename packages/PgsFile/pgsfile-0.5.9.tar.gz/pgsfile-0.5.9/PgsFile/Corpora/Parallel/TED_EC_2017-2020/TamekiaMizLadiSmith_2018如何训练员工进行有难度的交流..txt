We live in a world where the collection of data is happening 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. This data is usually collected by what we call a front-desk specialist now. These are the retail clerks at your favorite department stores, the cashiers at the grocery stores, the registration specialists at the hospital and even the person that sold you your last movie ticket. They ask discreet questions, like: "May I please have your zip code?" Or, "Would you like to use your savings card today?" All of which gives us data. However, the conversation becomes a little bit more complex when the more difficult questions need to be asked.
﻿数据收集无时无刻不在我们生活的世界里发生 一天24小时、一周7天、 一年365天从不不断。 这些数据通常由 现在所谓的“前台专员”收集。 他们中有你最爱光顾的 百货公司的零售店员、 杂货店的收银员、 医院的登记专员， 甚至还有 卖给你上一张电影票的售票员。 他们问一些简单的问题，像是： “请问您的邮编是多少？“ 或是， “您今天要用储蓄卡吗？” 这些问题都会为我们提供数据。 但是，当需要问更难的问题时， 这类谈话也会变得稍复杂些。
Let me tell you a story, see. Once upon a time, there was a woman named Miss Margaret. Miss Margaret had been a front-desk specialist for almost 20 years. And in all that time, she has never, and I do mean never, had to ask a patient their gender, race or ethnicity. Because, see, now Miss Margaret has the ability to just look at you. Uh-huh. And she can tell if you are a boy or a girl, black or white, American or non-American. And in her mind, those were the only categories.
让我给你们讲个故事。 从前，有一位女士， 名叫玛格丽特小姐。 玛格丽特小姐当前台专员 已经快有20年了。 她工作时从不，我是说从不， 需要问患者性别、人种或民族。 因为，玛格丽特小姐有 “一眼辨人”的能力。 啊哈。 只要看你一眼， 就知道你是男孩还是女孩， 黑人还是白人， 美国人还是非美国人。 她头脑中的分类只有这些。
So imagine that grave day, when her sassy supervisor invited her to this "change everything" meeting and told her that would have to ask each and every last one of her patients to self-identify. She gave her six genders, eight races and over 100 ethnicities.
所以想象下那个沉重的日子， 那天她的粗鲁主管 请她参加一个“改变一切”会议， 并告诉她以后必须要求每个患者 进行自我分类识别。 主管给她6种性别、8种人种、 超过100种种族的分类。
Well, now, Miss Margaret was appalled. I mean, highly offended. So much so that she marched down to that human-resource department to see if she was eligible for an early retirement. And she ended her rant by saying that her sassy supervisor invited her to this "change everything" meeting and didn't, didn't, even, even bring, bring food, food, food, food.
好吧， 这下玛格丽特小姐目瞪口呆。 我是说，她火冒三丈， 气得她一头冲进人力资源部 询问自己是否有资格早点退休。 她叫嚷着抱怨着， 最后，她说了一句， 她的粗鲁主管邀请她参加 这个“改变一切”会议， 却、却没、没有 带、带食、食物。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
(Applause) (Cheers)
（鼓掌）（欢呼）
You know you've got to bring food to these meetings.
你们知道，这些会议能不带食物嘛。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
Anyway.
不管怎么说都得带。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
Now, that was an example of a healthcare setting, but of course, all businesses collect some form of data. True story: I was going to wire some money. And the customer service representative asked me if I was born in the United States. Now, I hesitated to answer her question, and before she even realized why I hesitated, she began to throw the company she worked for under the bus. She said, "Girl, I know it's stupid, but they makin' us ask this question."
刚说的是一个医疗背景下的例子， 不过很显然，所有行业 都会收集一些类型的数据。 一次真实经历：我曾经想汇些钱。 然后客服代表就问我 是否在美国出生。 我正犹豫着要不要回答， 在她甚至还没搞懂我为何犹豫之前， 她又开始拉自己的公司来背黑锅。 她说，“姑娘，我知道这问题很傻， 但是他们非叫我们问。“
(Laughter)
（笑声）
Because of the way she presented it to me, I was like, "Girl, why? Why they makin' you ask this question? Is they deportin' people?"
正因为她的反应， 于是我反问她， “姑娘，为什么？ 为什么他们让你问这个问题？ 他们要赶人出境吗？“
(Laughter)
（笑声）
But then I had to turn on the other side of me, the more professional speaker-poet side of me. The one that understood that there were little Miss Margarets all over the place. People who were good people, maybe even good employees, but lacked the ability to ask their questions properly and unfortunately, that made her look bad, but the worst, that made the business look even worse than how she was looking. Because she had no idea who I was. I mean, I literally could have been a woman who was scheduled to do a TED Talk and would use her as an example. Imagine that.
但是接下来我得表现出 自己的另一面， 更专业的演说家-诗人的一面。 我知道哪里都有玛格丽特小姐。 他们是好人，甚至也可能是好员工， 但是不会得体地向别人 提问自己的问题， 不幸的是， 那让她看起来很不专业， 最坏的是， 那让她的公司看起来 比她的“不专业”还糟糕。 因为她不知道我是谁。 我的意思是， 我可能是一个被指定做TED演讲、 并且会拿她当例子的女人。 想象一下。
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
And unfortunately, what happens is people would decline to answer the questions, because they feel like you would use the information to discriminate against them, all because of how you presented the information. And at that point, we get bad data. And everybody knows what bad data does. Bad data costs you time, it costs you money and it costs you resources.
不幸的是， 人们可能会拒绝回答这些问题， 因为他们觉得你会利用这些信息 歧视他们， 都是因为你表达信息的方式不当。 在那一点上，我们得到了坏数据。 人人都知道坏数据有哪些危害。 坏数据浪费你的时间、金钱， 浪费你的资源。
Unfortunately, when you have bad data, it also costs you a lot more, because we have health disparities, and we have social determinants of health, and we have the infant mortality, all of which depends on the data that we collect, and if we have bad data, than we have those issues still. And we have underprivileged populations that remain unfortunate and underprivileged, because the data that we're using is either outdated, or is not good at all or we don't have anything at all.
不幸的是，如果你有坏数据， 你还会因此损失更多。 因为我们有健康差距、 健康的社会决定因素、 婴儿死亡率， 所有这些都取决于我们收集的数据， 如果我们有坏数据， 那么这些问题仍会存在。 那些弱势群体 仍然在不幸和贫困中挣扎。 因为我们正在用的数据 要么就是过时， 要么就是不够优质， 要么就是手头没有任何数据。
Now, wouldn't it be amazing if people like Miss Margaret and the customer-service representative at the wiring place were graced to collect data with compassionate care? Can I explain to you what I mean by "graced?" I wrote an acrostic poem.
现在，如果那些像玛格丽特小姐  或者电汇处的客服代表一样的人 能带着爱心得体的收据数据， 这样不是很棒吗？ 请允许我给大家解释下 什么叫“得体” （graced）。 我写了一首藏头诗。
G: Getting the front desk specialist involved and letting them know
G：让前台专员参与并知晓
R: the Relevance of their role as they become
R：他们扮演的角色的重要性
A: Accountable for the accuracy of data while implementing
A: 为数据的准确性负责
C: Compassionate care within all encounters by becoming
C: 每次与人接触都施以爱心
E: Equipped with the education needed to inform people of why data collection is so important.
E: 具备所需知识以告知人们 D: 为何数据收集如此重要。
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
Now, I'm an artist. And so what happens with me is that when I create something artistically, the trainer in me is awakened as well. So what I did was, I began to develop that acrostic poem into a full training entitled "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D." Because I remember, being the front-desk specialist, and when I went to the office of equity to start working, I was like, "Is that why they asked us to ask that question?" It all became a bright light to me, and I realized that I asked people and I told people about -- I called them by the wrong gender, I called them by the wrong race, I called them by the wrong ethnicity, and the environment became hostile, people was offended and I was frustrated because I was not graced.
我是一名艺术家。 所以在我身上发生的 就是当我进行艺术创作时， 内心中隐藏的培训师也被唤醒。 所以我做的就是， 把藏头诗发展为一项全面的培训， 名叫 “我很得体”（G.R.A.C.E.D.） 因为我还记得自己做前台专员时， 当时我去一家股票公司开始上班。 我心想，“那就是为什么 他们叫我们去问那个问题吗？” 我忽然豁然开朗， 我意识到我询问客户、 我跟客户交谈时—— 我弄错了他们的性别、人种， 弄错了他们的民族， 于是谈话氛围变得不友好， 客户被惹恼，而我也很沮丧， 因为我没有表现出得体。
I remember my computerized training, and unfortunately, that training did not prepare me to deescalate a situation. It did not prepare me to have teachable moments when I had questions about asking the questions. I would look at the computer and say, "So, what do I do when this happens?" And the computer would say ... nothing, because a computer cannot talk back to you.
我还记得我参加的电脑化培训， 不幸的是， 那次培训并没教会我缓和紧张场面。 也没能在我对提问存在疑惑时， 提供我值得学习的内容。 我会对着电脑提问， “那么，这种情况下我怎么做？” 电脑会…… 沉默，因为电脑没法回你话。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
So that's the importance of having someone there who was trained to teach you and tell you what you do in situations like that. So, when I created the "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D" training, I created it with that experience that I had in mind, but also that conviction that I had in mind. Because I wanted the instructional design of it to be a safe space for open dialogue for people. I wanted to talk about biases, the unconscious ones and the conscious ones, and what we do.
所以这是由某个受训过的人来教你、 告诉你在类似情况下该做什么的 重要性所在。 所以， 当我设计“我很得体”培训时， 我结合了自己的经历， 也融入了自己的信念。 因为我希望它的教学设计 是创造一个 人们可以坦诚对话的安全场所。 我想谈一下偏见， 无意识的和有意识的偏见， 还想谈下我们所做的。
Because now I know that when you engage people in the why, it challenges their perspective, and it changes their attitudes. Now I know that data that we have at the front desk translates into research that eliminates disparities and finds cures. Now I know that teaching people transitional change instead of shocking them into change is always a better way of implementing change. See, now I know people are more likely to share information when they are treated with respect by knowledgeable staff members. Now I know that you don't have to be a statistician to understand the power and the purpose of data, but you do have to treat people with respect and have compassionate care. Now I know that when you've been graced, it is your responsibility to empower somebody else. But most importantly, now I know that when teaching human beings to communicate with other human beings, it should be delivered by a human being.
因为现在我知道， 当你问别人为什么时， 是在挑战他们的观点、态度。 现在我知道， 前台收集到的数据 会转变成研究数据， 用以消除差异、找到解决方法。 现在我知道， 教人循序渐进的改变， 而不是毫无征兆的 强迫他们突然改变 始终是实施变革的一种上策。 看吧，现在我知道， 人们更愿意分享信息 只要当他们受到尊重， 被训练有素的工作人员以礼相待 现在我知道， 你不必成为统计学家， 也能了解数据的力量和作用， 但是你得用尊重和爱心来对待他人。 现在我知道， 如果你已经很得体， 你有责任去教会别人也这样得体。 但是最重要的是， 现在我知道， 教导人与人之间 互相沟通交流， 应该是由一个“人”来完成。
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
So when y'all go to work and y'all schedule that "change everything" meeting --
所以如果你们去上班时， 也被安排了一个 “改变一切”会议——
(Laughter)
（笑声）
remember Miss Margaret. And don't forget the food, the food, the food, the food.
别忘了玛格丽特小姐。 别忘了食物、食物、食物。
Thank you.
谢谢。
(Applause) (Cheers)
（鼓掌）（欢呼）
Thank you.
谢谢。
