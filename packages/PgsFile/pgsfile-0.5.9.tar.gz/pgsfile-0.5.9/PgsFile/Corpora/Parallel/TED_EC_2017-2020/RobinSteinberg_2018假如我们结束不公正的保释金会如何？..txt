I will never forget the first time I visited a client in jail. The heavy, metal door slammed behind me, and I heard the key turn in the lock. The cement floor underneath me had a sticky film on it that made a ripping sound, like tape being pulled off a box, every time I moved my foot. The only connection to the outside world was a small window placed too high to see. There was a small, square table bolted to the floor and two metal chairs, one on either side. That was the first time I understood viscerally -- just for a fleeting moment -- what incarceration might feel like. And I promised myself all those years ago as a young, public defender that I would never, ever forget that feeling. And I never have. It inspired me to fight for each and every one of my clients' freedom as if it was my own.
﻿我永远不会忘记第一次 去监狱拜访当事人的情景。 沉重的铁门在我身后猛地关上， 钥匙在锁孔里转动的声音是那么清晰。 我脚下的水泥地上 是一层粘脚的薄膜， 会发出撕裂般的声响， 就像从纸盒上撕下胶带时 发出的那种声响， 它伴随着我迈出的每一步。 这里与外界的唯一联系就是 一个高得根本看不见的小窗。 房间里有一个被钉在地上、小小的方桌， 桌子两边 各有一张金属的椅子。 就在那一瞬间， 我第一次切身地体会到了 一个人被监禁的感觉。 身为一名年轻的公设辩护律师， 那时候的我就向自己保证， 我永远永远都不会忘记那种感觉。 我的确从来没有忘记。 那种感觉激励着我 为每一个当事人的自由而抗争， 就如为我自己的自由抗争一样。
Freedom. A concept so fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution. And yet, America is addicted to imprisonment. From slavery through mass incarceration, it always has been. Look, we all know the shocking numbers. The United States incarcerates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet. But what you may not know is that on any given night in America, almost half a million people go to sleep in those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything. These mothers and fathers and sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only: they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom. And that price is called bail.
自由—— 这个理念对于美国精神是如此重要， 我们把它永远写在了宪法中。 然而，美国却对囚禁犯人情有独钟。 从奴隶制到大规模监禁， 一直都是这样。 我们都知道这些可怕的数据。 美国的人均被监禁率 居世界之首。 但你可能并不知道， 在美国，每个晚上， 都有将近50万人 不得不在水泥牢房中入睡， 尽管他们还未被定罪。 这些母亲、父亲、儿子、女儿， 被囚禁的原因只有一个： 他们无法为他们的自由买单。 而这个价格，就是保释金。
Now, bail was actually created as a form of conditional release. The theory was simple: set bail at an amount that somebody could afford to pay -- they would pay it -- it would give them an incentive to come back to court; it would give them some skin in the game. Bail was never intended to be used as punishment. Bail was never intended to hold people in jail cells. And bail was never, ever intended to create a two-tier system of justice: one for the rich and one for everybody else. But that is precisely what it has done.
保释金的本意是一种有条件的释放。 初衷很简单： 把保释金定在一个人们 可以负担的价格—— 当事人便会支付， 同时这也是 他们回到法庭的动机， 毕竟他们投入了金钱。 保释金的本意从来不是惩罚， 也不是为了囚禁人们， 更不是要打造两层的司法系统： 一层给富人， 一层给其他所有人。 然而，这恰恰却是 保释金带来的后果。
75 percent of people in American local jails are there because they cannot pay bail. People like Ramel. On a chilly October afternoon, Ramel was riding his bicycle in his South Bronx neighborhood on his way to a market to pick up a quart of milk. He was stopped by the police. And when he demanded to know why he was being stopped, an argument ensued, and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground in handcuffs, being charged with "riding your bicycle on the sidewalk and resisting arrest." He was taken to court, where a judge set 500 dollars bail. But Ramel -- he didn't have 500 dollars. So this 32-year-old father was sent to "The Boat" -- a floating jail barge that sits on the East River between a sewage plant and a fish market. That's right, you heard me. In New York City, in 2018, we have a floating prison barge that sits out there and houses primarily black and brown men who cannot pay their bail.
在美国的地方看守所里，75%的人 都是因为交不起保释金， 才被囚禁在那里的。 比如拉米尔。 一个寒冷的10月下午， 拉米尔正在南布朗克斯的 小区骑着自行车， 他要去超市买牛奶。 他被警察拦了下来， 当他质问警察为什么要拦他时， 两人便争吵起来。 接着，没等他反应过来， 他已经被按到地上，手带镣铐， 罪名是“在人行道上骑自行车 并且抗捕”。 他被带上法庭， 法官判决他要交500美元的保释金， 可是拉米尔没有那么多钱。 于是，这位32岁的父亲 被送到了“那艘船”上。 “那艘船”是东河上的一个漂浮监狱， 处于一个污水处理厂和一个鱼市之间。 是的，你没听错。 在2018年的纽约， 我们还有一个漂浮监狱， 里面关押着的几乎都是 交不起保释金的 黑人和棕色皮肤得人群。
Let's talk for a moment about what it means to be in jail even for a few days. Well, it can mean losing your job, losing your home, jeopardizing your immigration status. It may even mean losing custody of your children. A third of sexual victimization by jail staff happens in the first three days in jail, and almost half of all jail deaths, including suicides, happen in that first week. What's more, if you're held in jail on bail, you're four times more likely to get a jail sentence than if you had been free, and that jail sentence will be three times longer. And if you are black or Latino and cash bail has been set, you are two times more likely to remain stuck in that jail cell than if you were white.
让我们来谈一谈， 在监狱里哪怕只是呆上几天 意味着什么。 它意味着你可能会丢掉工作， 丢掉房子， 危及你的移民身份， 甚至失去对你孩子的监护权。 三分之一的 监狱员工性侵囚犯案件 是在入狱三天内发生的。 将近一半的狱内死亡，包括自杀， 在入狱一周内发生。 而且，如果你是因 无法支付保释金而入狱， 你被判刑的几率是支付了保释金 而不用入狱的人的四倍； 而你的刑期 也将是那些人的三倍。 如果你是黑人或者拉丁裔， 并被要求支付保释金， 你被困在牢房的几率 是一个白人的两倍。
Jail in America is a terrifying, dehumanizing and violent experience. Now imagine for just one moment that it's you stuck in that jail cell, and you don't have the 500 dollars to get out. And someone comes along and offers you a way out. "Just plead guilty," they say. "You can go home back to your job. Just plead guilty. You can kiss your kids goodnight tonight." So you do what anybody would do in that situation. You plead guilty whether you did it or not. But now you have a criminal record that's going to follow you for the rest of your life.
在美国，坐牢是一个可怕、 毫无人性，而又充满暴力的经历。 现在，想象一下， 你被困在一个牢房里， 你没有500美元，无法获得自由。 这时有人过来，说可以帮你出狱。 “只要承认你有罪就行了，”他们说， “你可以回家，回去工作， 只要你承认自己有罪， 你今晚就可以亲吻你的孩子， 和他们道晚安。“ 于是你像所有 处在这个情境中的人一样， 承认自己有罪，无论真相如何。 但现在，你的记录上有了一个 将追随你终身的犯罪记录。
Jailing people because they don't have enough money to pay bail is one of the most unfair, immoral things we do as a society. But it is also expensive and counterproductive. American taxpayers -- they spend 14 billion dollars annually holding people in jail cells who haven't been convicted of anything. That's 40 million dollars a day. What's perhaps more confounding is it doesn't make us any safer. Research is clear that holding somebody in jail makes you significantly more likely to commit a crime when you get out than if you had been free all along.
仅仅因为人们无法支付保释金 而把他们关进监狱， 是这个社会极不公平和 极不道德的一件事。 同时，它还昂贵且无效。 美国的纳税人 每年要花掉140亿美元来关押那些 还尚未被定罪的人。 也就是，每天要花4000万美元！ 更让人不解的是， 这并不能让我们更加安全。 研究清楚地显示，坐过牢的人， 出来后犯罪的几率比从来没坐过牢的人 要高得多。 自由和不自由，结果有着天壤之别！ 低收入人群，以及有色人群， 一直都知道这一点。 只要保释制和监狱依然存在，  他们就不得不倾家荡产， 以交换他们亲人的自由。 然而刑事法律制度的触角 已经无处不在， 被囚禁的人实在太多了。 过去20年，美国99%的 监禁增长率—— 便是预审监禁的结果。
Freedom makes all the difference. Low-income communities and communities of color have known that for generations. Together, they have pooled their resources to buy their loved ones freedom for as long as bondage and jail cells existed. But the reach of the criminal legal system has grown too enormous, and the numbers have just too large. 99 percent of jail growth in America has been the result -- over the last 20 years -- of pre-trial incarceration.
我大半生都是一个公设辩护律师， 我曾眼睁睁地看着无数的当事人 被拖进监狱里， 仅仅是因为他们 无法支付保释金。 我眼睁睁地看着正义越来越关乎金钱， 这让人不禁怀疑 整个美国法律制度的合法性。 我来到这里， 只为说一句简单的话—— 它显而易见， 却又迫在眉睫。 自由和不自由，结果大不相同， 并且自由不应该被标价。
I have been a public defender for over half my life, and I have stood by and watched thousands of clients as they were dragged into those jail cells because they didn't have enough money to pay bail. I have watched as questions of justice were subsumed by questions of money, calling into question the legitimacy of the entire American legal system. I am here to say something simple -- something obvious, but something urgent. Freedom makes all the difference, and freedom should be free.
（掌声）
(Applause)
那我们应该怎么做呢？ 这是一个我已经思考了十年的问题。 有一天，我和丈夫大卫坐在餐桌旁， 他也是一个公共辩护律师。 我们一边吃中餐外卖， 一边抱怨保释金的不公平。 这时大卫抬起头，说： “为什么我们不建立一个保释金基金， 然后把我们的当事人都保释出来呢？“ 就在那意外的一瞬间， 布朗克斯自由基金会的想法诞生了。
But how are we going to make that happen? Well, that's the question I was wrestling with over a decade ago when I was sitting at a kitchen table with my husband, David, who is also a public defender. We were eating our Chinese takeout and venting about the injustice of it all when David looked up and said, "Why don't we just start a bail fund, and just start bailing our clients out of jail?" And in that unexpected moment, the idea for the Bronx Freedom Fund was born.
其实我们不知道会发生什么。 很多人都说我们疯了， 说我们会失去所有这些钱的。 当事人不会回来， 失去的保释金又不是他们的钱。 可是，如果当事人回来了呢？ 我们知道，保释金 会在刑事诉讼结束之后被退回， 因此它会返回到基金会， 而我们可以一遍遍地 用这个钱支付保释金。 这就是我们下的豪赌， 并且我们赢了。
Look, we didn't know what to expect. There were plenty of people that told us we were crazy and we were going to lose all of the money. People wouldn't come back because they didn't have any stake in it. But what if clients did come back? We knew that bail money comes back at the end of a criminal case, so it could come back into the fund, and we could use it over and over again for more and more bail. That was our big bet, and that bet paid off.
在过去十年里， 我们一直在为纽约的 低收入人群支付保释金。 我们从中学到的东西，颠覆了我们 对于为什么人们会回到法庭、 对于刑事法律制度本身 如何运作的认知。 原来，保释金并不是 让当事人回到法庭的动机。 因为当布朗克斯自由基金会 代付了保释金时， 96%的当事人 出席了所有的庭审， 完全摧毁了他们是 因为保释金才回来的谎言。 这可以有力地证明我们不需要钱， 或者脚镣， 或者多余的监督、监控系统。 我们只需要简单的出庭提醒， 提醒当事人 什么时候应该出席法庭。
Over the past 10 years, we have been paying bails for low-income residents of New York City, and what we have learned has exploded our ideas of why people come back to court and how the criminal legal system itself is operated. Turns out money isn't what makes people come back to court. We know this because when the Bronx Freedom Fund pays bail, 96 percent of clients return for every court appearance, laying waste to the myth that it's money that mattered. It's powerful evidence that we don't need cash or ankle bracelets or unnecessary systems of surveillance and supervision. We simply need court reminders -- simple court reminders about when to come back to court.
接着，我们发现因轻罪而坐牢的人， 90%都会承认有罪。 而如果有了基金会的保释金， 超过一半的案件都会被撤销。 从布朗克斯自由基金会成立至今， 我们只有不到2%的当事人 获刑。
Next, we learned that if you're held in jail on a misdemeanor, 90 percent of people will plead guilty. But when the fund pays bail, over half the cases are dismissed. And in the entire history of the Bronx Freedom Fund, fewer than two percent of our clients have ever received a jail sentence of any kind.
（掌声）
(Applause)
一周之后，拉米尔 依然在漂浮监狱的牢房里， 眼看就要失去一切， 他已做好承认有罪的准备。 这时布朗克斯自由基金会插手了， 为他支付了保释金。 现在他得以和他的女儿重聚， 并能够在监狱之外争取自己的利益。 没错，这花了一点时间—— 准确的说，是两年—— 但是最终， 针对他的诉讼完全撤销了。 对拉米尔——
Ramel, a week later -- he was still on the boat, locked in that jail cell. He was on the cusp of losing everything, and he was about to plead guilty, and the Bronx Freedom Fund intervened and paid his bail. Now, reunited with his daughter, he was able to fight his case from outside. Look, it took some time -- two years, to be exact -- but at the end of that, his case was dismissed in its entirety. For Ramel --
（掌声）
(Applause)
对拉米尔来说，布朗克斯 自由基金是他的救命稻草， 但对其他无数 被关在监狱的美国人来说， 却没有自由基金来解救他们。 是时候我们为此做点什么了。 是时候做件大事了， 是时候挺身而出了， 也许是时候我们大胆地冒个险了？
For Ramel, the Bronx Freedom Fund was a lifeline, but for countless other Americans locked in jail cells, there is no freedom fund coming. It's time to do something about that. It's time to do something big. It's time to do something bold. It's time to do something, maybe, audacious?
（笑声）
(Laughter)
我们想要把我们 从布朗克斯发展起来的、 被证实有效的、循环的 保释金-基金模式 扩张到整个美国。 在人们被囚禁之前， 和法制体系对抗。
We want to take our proven, revolving bail-fund model that we built in the Bronx and spread it across America, attacking the front end of the legal system before incarceration begins.
（掌声）
(Applause)
（欢呼）
(Cheers)
（掌声）
(Applause)
我们的计划是这样的。
Here's the plan.
（掌声）
(Applause)
我们将为尽可能多的人 支付保释金， 越快越好。 在接下来的五年里， 与公共辩护律师 还有当地社区组织合作， 我们将在高需求地区 设立40个站点。 我们的目标是把16万人保释出来。 我们的战略是建立在 保释金最终会回到 我们手中的基础上。 布朗克斯的数据显示， 每一美元每年 都可以被用上两三次， 这让我们的力量放大了数倍。 也就是说，今天捐赠的一美元 将在未来的五年内， 帮助15个人支付保释金。 我们的战略同时也要依靠  那些曾亲身经历过这种不公的 人的智慧和领导力。
We're going to bail out as many people as we can as quickly as we can. Over the next five years, partnering with public defenders and local community organizations, we're going to set up 40 sites in high-need jurisdictions. The goal is to bail out 160,000 people. Our strategy leverages the fact that bail money comes back at the end of a case. Data from the Bronx shows that a dollar can be used two or three times a year, creating a massive force multiplier. So a dollar donated today can be used to pay bail for up to 15 people over the next five years. Our strategy also relies on the experience and the wisdom and the leadership of those who have experienced this injustice firsthand.
（掌声）
(Applause)
每个保释金项目站点 都会有一个保释金“破坏者”团队。 他们是充满热情和献身精神的、 来自当地社区的支持者， 其中很多人都曾有过 被监禁的经历。 团队会为当事人支付保释金， 在他们的案件被审理时支持他们， 为他们提供一切 他们所需要的资源和支持。 我们已经有两个投入运营的站点。 一个在奥克拉荷马州的塔尔萨， 一个在密苏里州的圣路易斯。 拉米尔呢？ 他正在纽约昆斯县接受训练， 马上就会成为一个保释金“破坏者”。
Each bail project site will be staffed by a team of bail disrupters. These are passionate, dedicated advocates from local communities, many of whom were formerly incarcerated themselves, who will pay bails and support clients while their cases are going through the legal system, providing them with whatever resources and support they may need. Our first two sites are up and running. One in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and one in St. Louis, Missouri. And Ramel? He's training right now to be a bail disrupter in Queens County, New York.
（掌声）
(Applause)
我们接下来的三个站点将在 达拉斯、底特律和肯塔基州的 路易斯维尔展开。 这个保释金项目 将对金钱保释的制度 发起前所未有的攻击。 同时，我们也会倾听、收集、 宣传并尊重我们当事人的故事， 以改变人们的感受和想法。 我们还要收集我们需要的、 国家层面的关键数据， 以开创一条更好的道路， 以避免创建另一种形式的压迫系统。 这个保释金项目， 通过在5年内保释出16万人， 将成为美国历史上 最大的非政府反监禁项目之一。
Our next three sites are ready to launch in Dallas, Detroit and Louisville, Kentucky. The Bail Project will attack the money bail system on an unprecedented scale. We will also listen, collect and elevate and honor the stories of our clients so that we can change hearts and minds, and we will collect critical, national data that we need so we can chart a better path forward so that we do not recreate this system of oppression in just another form. The Bail Project, by bailing out 160,000 people over the next five years, will become one of the largest non-governmental decarcerations of Americans in history.
事实上——
So look --
（掌声）
(Applause)
现有的刑事法律制度 需要被废除。 但从我多年在这个系统里 工作的经验来看， 真正的、系统的改变需要时间， 需要实施不同的策略。 所以它需要我们大家一起努力。 它需要民事权利诉讼律师、 社区组织者、学术界人士、 媒体、慈善家、 学生、歌手、诗人， 当然还包括那些被系统迫害的 人的声音和努力。 但我也知道： 团结一致，我相信我们 可以终结大规模监禁。
the criminal legal system, as it exists -- it needs to be dismantled. But here's the thing I know from decades in the system: real, systemic change takes time, and it takes a variety of strategies. So it's going to take all of us. It's going to take the civil rights litigators, the community organizers, the academics, the media, the philanthropists, the students, the singers, the poets, and, of course, the voices and efforts of those who are impacted by this system. But here's what I also know: together, I believe we can end mass incarceration.
但最后还有一件事： 那些被关在美国各地的 监狱里的人， 那些支付不了保释金而被囚禁的人， 他们现在就需要 一条拯救他们的生命线。 这时，我们的保释金项目 就有了用武之地。 我们有可行的模型，有行动计划， 还有一群正在发展壮大的 保释金“破坏者”们。 他们有足够的勇气 梦想未来，为之奋斗。 一次一份保释金， 直到真正自由平等的正义 在美国成为现实。 谢谢大家。
But one last thing: those people, sitting in America, in those jail cells, in every corner of the country, who are held in jail on bail bondage, right now -- they need a lifeline today. That's where The Bail Project comes in. We have a proven model, a plan of action, and a growing network of bail disrupters who are audacious enough to dream big and fight hard, one bail at a time, for as long it takes, until true freedom and equal justice are a reality in America.
（掌声）
