Namaskar. I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age, and I don't use Botox as yet. 
大家好。 

(Laughter) 
我是一位电影明星， 今年51岁了。 但我还不到要打肉毒杆菌的地步。 

So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw like a 21-year-old in my movies. Yeah, I do that. I sell dreams and I peddle love to millions of people back home in India who assume that I'm the best lover in the world. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
尽管如此， 我戏里戏外都当自己21岁， 对，没错 我贩卖梦想， 也向数百万的印度人传递着爱 他们都相信我是 这个世界上最棒的梦中情人。 

If you don't tell anyone, I'm going to tell you I'm not, but I never let that assumption go away. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
偷偷告诉你，其实我不是 但是我宁可大家 一直相信这个误会 

I've also been made to understand there are lots of you here who haven't seen my work, and I feel really sad for you. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
我也听说， 今天在座的很多人， 从来没看过我的电影， 我真为你们感到遗憾。 

(Applause) 
（笑声） 

That doesn't take away from the fact that I'm completely self-obsessed, as a movie star should be. 
（掌声） 

(Laughter) 
好吧 我承认我是有些自恋， 搞得好像电影明星 本来都这么自以为是似的。 

That's when my friends, Chris and Juliet called me here to speak about the future "you." Naturally, it follows I'm going to speak about the present me. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
这就是为什么我的朋友 克里斯和朱莉叶找我来这里 来聊聊未来的“你们" 自然而然地， 我就要先聊聊现在的“我" 

Because I truly believe that humanity is a lot like me. 
(笑声） 

(Laughter) 
因为我真的相信， 人性和我很像。 

It is. It is. It's an aging movie star, grappling with all the newness around itself, wondering whether it got it right in the first place, and still trying to find a way to keep on shining regardless. 
（笑声） 

I was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of India, New Delhi. And my father was a freedom fighter. My mother was, well, just a fighter like mothers are. And much like the original homo sapiens, we struggled to survive. When I was in my early 20s, I lost both my parents, which I must admit seems a bit careless of me now, but — 
它就是，就像是， 一个正在老去的电影明星， 一边要想着与周围的新生事物抗争， 一边又要考虑自己 从一开始到底学得对不对， 还要想办法， 保持我表面的光鲜亮丽。 

(Laughter) 
我出生在印度首都 新德里的一个难民营里， 而我的父亲是一位自由战士， 我的母亲呢，就像所有的母亲一样 也活得像个战士 听起来有点像是原始人， 我们为了生存而苦苦挣扎。 在我20岁出头的时候， 我爸妈就过世了， 对于现在的我来说， 不得不承认我有点忘了。 但是 - 

I do remember the night my father died, and I remember the driver of a neighbor who was driving us to the hospital. He mumbled something about "dead people don't tip so well" and walked away into the dark. And I was only 14 then, and I put my father's dead body in the back seat of the car, and my mother besides me, I started driving back from the hospital to the house. And in the middle of her quiet crying, my mother looked at me and she said, "Son, when did you learn to drive?" And I thought about it and realized, and I said to my mom, "Just now, Mom." 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
我依稀记得的是我爸过世那晚， 我记得是一位邻居载我们到医院的。 他一个人喃喃着， “人死了就收不到小费了。” 然后一个人消失在了黑夜中 那时我才14岁， 我把我爸的尸体放在后座， 我的妈妈坐在副驾驶上， 我就准备开车要从医院回家， 我妈哭到一半， 忽然转头问我， “儿子，你怎么会开车的?” 然后我想了一下， 告诉我妈妈说， “刚刚学会的，妈妈。” 

So from that night onwards, much akin to humanity in its adolescence, I learned the crude tools of survival. And the framework of life was very, very simple then, to be honest. You know, you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do. I thought celiac was a vegetable, and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's lost comrade in "Star Trek." 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
自从那天晚上之后， 就好像是人性 步入了青春期一样， 我学会了最基本的生存方式， 老实说，其实这些 生活的条条框框不难学。 反正你有什么吃什么， 人家叫你做什么就做什么。 我曾以为 ”腹腔 (Celiac)“ 是一种蔬菜， “素食主义者(Vegan)" 是电影 星际迷航里的“瓦肯族 (Vulcan)”。 

You married the first girl that you dated, and you were a techie if you could fix the carburetor in your car. I really thought that gay was a sophisticated English word for happy. And Lesbian, of course, was the capital of Portugal, as you all know. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
我还相信你们都会和 自己第一个约会的女孩结婚； 相信会修汽车化油器， 就算是个汽车专家了； 天真地以为英文单词 "gay"  （同性恋）就只是开心的意思； 理所当然地以为"Lesbian"  （女同性恋）就是葡萄牙首都里斯本（Lisbon）。 

Where was I? We relied on systems created through the toil and sacrifice of generations before to protect us, and we felt that governments actually worked for our betterment. Science was simple and logical, Apple was still then just a fruit owned by Eve first and then Newton, not by Steve Jobs, until then. And "Eureka!" was what you screamed when you wanted to run naked on the streets. You went wherever life took you for work, and people were mostly welcoming of you. Migration was a term then still reserved for Siberian trains, not human beings. Most importantly, you were who you were and you said what you thought. 
（笑声） 

Then in my late 20s, I shifted to the sprawling metropolis of Mumbai, and my framework, like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity, began to alter. In the urban rush for a new, more embellished survival, things started to look a little different. I met people who had descended from all over the world, faces, races, genders, money-lenders. Definitions became more and more fluid. Work began to define you at that time in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner, and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me, almost too thick to hold on to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow. Ideas were flowing with more freedom and speed. And I experienced the miracle of human innovation and cooperation, and my own creativity, when supported by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor, catapulted me into superstardom. 
好吧，我扯远了。 我们依赖着的体制生活， 是祖祖辈辈们 用血汗创造出来的成果， 为了来庇护我们的； 我们相信政府一定在 为人民的美好未来而努力； 科学是简单而富有逻辑， 苹果也还只是一种水果， 先被夏娃咬了一口， 之后又砸到了牛顿， 还不是现在斯蒂芬乔布斯的品牌。 而阿基米德大喊着：“我知道了！”， 其实只是想在街上裸奔的借口。 你为了工作随遇而安， 大家大多都对你很友善。 迁徙也只是一个词语 用来形容西伯利亚 白鹤飞越国界，而非难民。 更重要的是， 你可以做你自己， 你可以说你想要说的。 

I started to feel that I had arrived, and generally, by the time I was 40, I was really, really flying. I was all over the place. You know? I'd done 50 films by then and 200 songs, and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians. I had been given the highest civil honor by the French government, the title of which for the life of me I can't pronounce even until now. 
然后在我将近30岁时， 我搬到了热闹而繁华的孟买都市区， 我的人生， 就像人性进入了工业革命， 发生了翻天覆地的变化， 要在千变万化的城市中寻求生存， 一切都变得不一样了。 我遇见了来自世界各地的人， 来自不同的种族， 拥有不同的面孔，性别，财富 我的价值观开始改变， 你的职业成了定义你的标准， 这一切变得无比客观， 所有的体制对于 我来说都变得不再可靠， 变得很难去 去解释人的多样性， 而且人类也是需要 不断进步、成长的。 许多想法变得更加自由， 传播速度也越来越快。 我经历了人类创新与合作的奇迹， 还有我自己创造的奇迹， 当我得到所有的支持和资源， 是它们把我推上了巨星的位置。 

(Laughter) 
我开始意识到我成功了， 在我40岁左右， 我感觉自己真的就像是身处云端 我变得无所不在， 无所不能。 你知道，到目前为止 我拍了50部电影， 和超过200首歌舞插曲。 马来西亚授予我勋爵， 法国政府给我颁发 最高的平民荣誉， 虽然我至今还念不出 那个头衔的名字。 

I'm sorry, France, and thank you, France, for doing that. But much bigger than that, I got to meet Angelina Jolie — 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
抱歉，法国，还是非常 感激你们颁奖给我。 但是比那个更大的荣幸是 我见到了安吉丽娜朱莉(Angelina Jolie) - 

for two and a half seconds. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
虽然就只有两秒半 

And I'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere. OK, maybe not. And I sat next to Hannah Montana on a round dinner table with her back towards me most of the time. Like I said, I was flying, from Miley to Jolie, and humanity was soaring with me. We were both pretty much flying off the handle, actually. 
（笑声） 

And then you all know what happened. The internet happened. I was in my late 40s, and I started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage and assuming that, you know, people who peered into my world would admire it for the miracle I believed it to be. But something else awaited me and humanity. You know, we had expected an expansion of ideas and dreams with the enhanced connectivity of the world. We had not bargained for the village-like enclosure of thought, of judgment, of definition that flowed from the same place that freedom and revolution was taking place in. Everything I said took a new meaning. Everything I did — good, bad, ugly — was there for the world to comment upon and judge. As a matter of fact, everything I didn't say or do also met with the same fate. 
但是我觉得她一定 记得我们在哪里见过， 好吧 也许没有， 我也曾和孟汉娜 (Hannah Montana) 同桌共进晚餐， 虽然她几乎都是背对着我的。 就像我说的，我身处云端， 从麦莉到朱莉，我的事业到达了巅峰， 人性也随之驰骋 在这黄金的岁月里， 可以说我和人性的发展 几乎是都到达了巅峰， 

Four years ago, my lovely wife Gauri and me decided to have a third child. It was claimed on the net that he was the love child of our first child who was 15 years old. Apparently, he had sown his wild oats with a girl while driving her car in Romania. And yeah, there was a fake video to go with it. And we were so disturbed as a family. My son, who is 19 now, even now when you say "hello" to him, he just turns around and says, "But bro, I didn't even have a European driving license." 
之后发生的变化各位都知道， 网络出现了。 在我快要50岁的时候， 我默默地玩起了推特， 然后期待圈外人也能 有兴趣窥探我的内在世界， 或者欣赏 我所相信的那些奇迹。 但是事情并没有 如我和人们所预料的， 我们以为想法和梦想 会随着网络扩散出去。 没想到的是， 那些故步自封的成见、断论和解读， 也随着自由与思想的革命， 一同产生。 我说的每一句话都会 以不同的方式被解读， 我做的每一件事 -  不论好坏还是美丑 - 就在那里让全世界去评论和判断。 事实上我没做过的事或说过的话， 也要面临着同样的命运。 

(Laughter) 
四年前， 我和我太太高丽决定要第三个孩子。 结果网上居然说， 那是我的大儿子(Aryan Khan)的小孩， 我的大儿子， 他四年前只有15岁， 网上居然说， 是他在罗马尼亚 和他的女友搞车震， 播下的野种。 而且啊 还流出一段假视频， 我们全家都不堪其扰， 我的儿子，现在19岁了， 现在就算你只是 跟他打个招呼说“你好", 他都会马上说， “嘿伙计，我根本没有欧洲驾照。” 

Yeah. In this new world, slowly, reality became virtual and virtual became real, and I started to feel that I could not be who I wanted to be or say what I actually thought, and humanity at this time completely identified with me. I think both of us were going through our midlife crisis, and humanity, like me, was becoming an overexposed prima donna. I started to sell everything, from hair oil to diesel generators. Humanity was buying everything from crude oil to nuclear reactors. You know, I even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit to reinvent myself. I must admit I failed miserably. And just an aside I want to say on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men and Supermen of the world, you have to commend them, because it really hurts in the crotch, that superhero suit. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
是啊 在这个崭新的世界里， 慢慢地真假变得难以区分。 我开始觉得， 我不能做我自己， 我不能随便发表我的想法， 而此时的人性 就跟我一模一样。 和我一起步入了中年危机， 人性就像我，变成了一个 整天被狗仔队追赶的主角 我开始贩卖一切， 从发油到柴油发电机。 而人性开始收买一切， 从原油到核反应堆。 你知道 我甚至 还想过穿超人紧身衣 为了重新塑身。 我必须承认我彻底失败了， 在此打个岔， 代表蝙蝠侠，蜘蛛人， 还有这个世界的超人们， 请各位把掌声送给他们， 因为穿超人装，胯下超疼。 

Yeah, I'm being honest. I need to tell you this here. Really. And accidentally, I happened to even invent a new dance form which I didn't realize, and it became a rage. So if it's all right, and you've seen a bit of me, so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you. It was called the Lungi dance. So if it's all right, I'll just show you. I'm talented otherwise. 
（笑声） 

(Cheers) 
我忍不住要提一下， 真的很痛。 于是一不小心， 我就发明了我的新舞步， 无意间成了一股新的潮流。 不介意的话， 反正你们也知道我脸皮比较厚， 我要跳一下。 这叫做腰布舞 (Lungi dance《钦奈快车》歌舞） 不介意的话，我在这里 给你们秀两招，虽然没有很厉害。 

So it went something like this. 
（欢呼） 

Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi. 
所以跳起来就是这样子的。 

That's it. It became a rage. 
（腰布舞）隆基丹斯 隆基丹斯 ... 隆基丹斯 隆基丹斯 ... ... 隆基丹斯 隆基丹斯 隆基。 

(Cheers) 
就是这舞步，风靡一时。 

It really did. Like you notice, nobody could make any sense of what was happening except me, and I didn't give a damn, really, because the whole world, and whole humanity, seemed as confused and lost as I was. I didn't give up then. I even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media like everyone else does. I thought if I put on philosophical tweets out there people will think I'm with it, but some of the responses I got from those tweets were extremely confusing acronyms which I didn't understand. You know? ROFL, LOL. "Adidas," somebody wrote back to one of my more thought-provoking tweets and I was wondering why would you name a sneaker, I mean, why would you write back the name of a sneaker to me? And I asked my 16-year-old daughter, and she enlightened me. "Adidas" now means "All day I dream about sex." 
（欢呼） 

(Laughter) 
真的很火。 除了我之外， 真的没人知道为什么会这样， 不过我也不在乎，真的。 因为整个世界，所有的人 其实都和我一样茫然失措。 但我没有放弃， 我试图在社交媒体上 重新塑造自己的形象， 就像其他人一样。 我认为如果我常发 一些有哲理的推文， 人们也许会觉得我很有内涵， 但我也收到一些回复， 我真的完全看不懂，你知道吗? 像那类缩写或网络新词  ROFL（笑死我了）, LOL（笑出声）等 还有“Adidas”，有人在我 非常有哲理的推文下回复这 我还想我发的和运动品牌 阿迪达斯有什么关系？ 我的意思是为什么你要 给我留言阿迪达斯？ 然后我去问我16岁的女儿， 她一下子点拨了我。 “Adidas”的意思是 "我整天想着做爱"的英文缩写 

Really. I didn't know if you know that. So I wrote back, "WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas, thanking secretly that some acronyms and things won't change at all. WTF. 
（笑声） 

But here we are. I am 51 years old, like I told you, and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding, I just want to tell you if there has been a momentous time for humanity to exist, it is now, because the present you is brave. The present you is hopeful. The present you is innovative and resourceful, and of course, the present you is annoyingly indefinable. And in this spell-binding, imperfect moment of existence, feeling a little brave just before I came here, I decided to take a good, hard look at my face. And I realized that I'm beginning to look more and more like the wax statue of me at Madame Tussaud's. 
真的。 你们知道这个吗。 所以我就回复阿迪达斯先生， “WTF”（搞什么鬼啊）的缩写 好险我居然还是知道一些缩写的。 WTF (What The F*)  搞什么鬼啊 

(Laughter) 
然后来到了现在， 我之前告诉你， 我今年51岁， 而我却还在研究 那些荒谬的缩写含义， 我只是想告诉你， 如果人性真的有 那么一刻是存在的， 那么就是现在， 因为现在的你是勇敢的， 现在的你是充满希望的， 现在的你是拥有着创意和智慧的， 当然现在的你也充满着无限的可能。 此刻在这个迷幻 却又不完美的存在， 让我在上台前更有勇气， 我决定好好凝视着我的面容， 然后我越看越仔细， 就像在看我自己在 杜莎夫人蜡像馆的蜡像一样。 

Yeah, and in that moment of realization, I asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me: Do I need to fix my face? Really. I'm an actor, like I told you, a modern expression of human creativity. The land I come from is the source of inexplicable but very simple spirituality. In its immense generosity, India decided somehow that I, the Muslim son of a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams, should become its king of romance, the "Badhshah of Bollywood," the greatest lover the country has ever seen ... with this face. Yeah. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
是的，就在那一刻 我灵光一闪， 我问了人性和我自己 最关键的问题： 我需要整容吗？ 真的，就像我所告诉你的， 作为一个演员， 是人类创意现代化的展示。 我的家乡， 印度是一个神秘又单纯的灵性之地。 因为它的慷慨和包容， 印度不知怎么地， 让一个穷困潦倒的、穆斯林的儿子 意外地做起了贩卖梦想的生意， 成了浪漫之王的代名词， 成了宝莱坞之王， 成了这国家前所未有的梦中情人... 用这样一张脸。 是的 就是这样 

Which has alternately been described as ugly, unconventional, and strangely, not chocolatey enough. 
（笑声） 

(Laughter) 
甚至可以被描述为有点丑的， 有点标新立异的， 有点奇怪的脸， 但还好不算太黑。 

The people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love, and I've learned from these people that neither power nor poverty can make your life more magical or less tortuous. I've learned from the people of my country that the dignity of a life, a human being, a culture, a religion, a country actually resides in its ability for grace and compassion. I've learned that whatever moves you, whatever urges you to create, to build, whatever keeps you from failing, whatever helps you survive, is perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known to mankind, and that is love. A mystic poet from my land famously wrote, (Recites poem in Hindi) (Poem ends) Which loosely translates into that whatever — yeah, if you know Hindi, please clap, yeah. 
（笑声） 

(Applause) 
来自这片古老土地的人们， 用他们无尽的爱拥抱着我， 我从他们身上学到了， 有权有势也好，落魄潦倒也好， 都不能使你的生活变得更加精彩 或是少些波折。 我从我的同胞们那里学到了， 作为一个生命， 一个人，一种文化， 一种宗教，一个国家的自豪 其实真真切切地渗透在 人们对包容之心与怜悯之情的追求。 我学到了无论是什么感动了你， 无论是什么激励着你， 驱使着你去创造，去塑造， 是什么让你从跌倒中爬起， 是什么让你从绝境中重生， 都可能是我们所人类知晓的 最简单的、最古老的感情， 那就是爱。 一位来自我故乡的 神秘主义诗人曾写道， 

It's very difficult to remember. Which loosely translates into actually saying that all the books of knowledge that you might read and then go ahead and impart your knowledge through innovation, through creativity, through technology, but mankind will never be the wiser about its future unless it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings. The two and a half alphabets which form the word "प्रेम," which means "love," if you are able to understand that and practice it, that itself is enough to enlighten mankind. So I truly believe the future "you" has to be a you that loves. Otherwise it will cease to flourish. It will perish in its own self-absorption. 
（朗诵印地语诗句...） 

So you may use your power to build walls and keep people outside, or you may use it to break barriers and welcome them in. You may use your faith to make people afraid and terrify them into submission, or you can use it to give courage to people so they rise to the greatest heights of enlightenment. You can use your energy to build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness of destruction, or you can use it to spread the joy of light to millions. You may filthy up the oceans callously and cut down all the forests. You can destroy the ecology, or turn to them with love and regenerate life from the waters and trees. You may land on Mars and build armed citadels, or you may look for life-forms and species to learn from and respect. And you can use all the moneys we all have earned to wage futile wars and give guns in the hands of little children to kill each other with, or you can use it to make more food to fill their stomachs with. 
（...诗结束） 

My country has taught me the capacity for a human being to love is akin to godliness. It shines forth in a world which civilization, I think, already has tampered too much with. In the last few days, the talks here, the wonderful people coming and showing their talent, talking about individual achievements, the innovation, the technology, the sciences, the knowledge we are gaining by being here in the presence of TED Talks and all of you are reasons enough for us to celebrate the future "us." But within that celebration the quest to cultivate our capacity for love and compassion has to assert itself, has to assert itself, just as equally. 
大致翻译一下的意思是 - 对啊，如果你听得懂印地语， 可以先鼓掌。 

So I believe the future "you" is an infinite you. It's called a chakra in India, like a circle. It ends where it begins from to complete itself. A you that perceives time and space differently understands both your unimaginable and fantastic importance and your complete unimportance in the larger context of the universe. A you that returns back to the original innocence of humanity, which loves from the purity of heart, which sees from the eyes of truth, which dreams from the clarity of an untampered mind. 
（掌声） 

The future "you" has to be like an aging movie star who has been made to believe that there is a possibility of a world which is completely, wholly, self-obsessively in love with itself. A world — really, it has to be a you to create a world which is its own best lover. That I believe, ladies and gentlemen, should be the future "you." 
有点难记得， 大致翻译一下，意思是说 你从书里汲取知识之精华， 然后把知识传递下去， 用在发明，创造，还有科技， 但这样依旧无法使人类的 未来走向更深切的智慧， 除非他们能对同胞们 怀揣着爱与关怀之心， 这两个半的字母 构成了印地语里的“प्रेम”， 那意味着“爱”。 如果你能真正理解它， 并把它记在心中， 并身体力行。 所以我真的相信未来的“你们", 必须是一个愿意 “去爱”和“接受爱”的你 否则这个世界的未来将黯淡失色， 一切都会在自我的沉醉中消失殆尽。 

Thank you very much. Shukriya. 
所以你可以用你的力量 去筑起心中高高的围墙， 把他人都拒之门外， 或者你可以用它 来打破壁垒，欢迎他们； 你可以用你的信念， 让人心生畏惧， 把他们吓到无奈地屈从于你， 或者你可以用信念去鼓舞他人， 让他们也能获得深刻的启迪； 你可以用你的能源， 去制造核导弹， 散播毁灭性的黑暗， 或者你可以把喜悦之光 传递给成千上万的人们； 你可以去污染海洋， 无情地砍下所有的森林， 你可以破坏生态的平衡， 或者用爱去浇灌这一切 让所有的树木和水源获得新生； 你可以登陆火星 去建立军事的堡垒， 或是怀着求知和尊敬 去寻找新生命和物种； 你还可以用赚来的所有钱 去发动百害而无一利的战争 把枪支交在年幼的孩童手中 教他们互相残杀， 或者你可以用那些钱 去提供更多的食物， 去帮助饥肠辘辘的人们。 

(Applause) 
我的国家教给我， 一个人拥有爱的能力， 就像是对神灵万物的敬畏， 爱的荣光足以普照大地， 照亮这个已经没有文明可言的世界。 在过去的几天里， 无数才华横溢的演讲者在这里 带来了他们各种精彩的分享。 有他们的个人成就、创新、技术、 科学和知识。 光是坐在台下就收获无数， 这归功于TED Talk平台 还有所有的你们。 这让我们都有足够的理由 去庆祝未来的“你我”。 但是在欢庆的同时， 不要忘了去培养爱和怜悯的能力， 这是我们需要珍惜的能力， 让它们得以展现， 缺一不可。 

Thank you. 
所以我相信未来的“你们”， 是一个充满着无限可能的“你”。 在印度我把称之为 “心之轮回”(Chakra)，就像是圆， 周而复始，生生不息， 一个用全新的角度 去感受时空奥妙的“你"， 同时明白， 你也拥有无法想象的潜能， 和无与伦比的重要性， 但在整个浩瀚的宇宙中， 又显得那么的微不足道。 我还相信那是一个能回首的“你” 去寻回人性本身的天真无邪， 用孩童般的初心去热爱世界， 用新生般的眼睛去看透真相， 用最澄澈的心灵去追寻梦想， 

(Applause) 
我相信未来的“你们"一定会 像是我这个正在老去的电影明星， 他相信这个世界拥有的可能， 拥有的机会， 它能让全世界毫无保留地、 完完全全地、痴迷般地 去热爱自己。 这个世界 - 真的， 必须是一个由你 去创造的世界， 而唯有你才是它最好的爱人。 所以我相信， 女士们先生们， 这才是大家未来的目标。 

Thank you. 
谢谢大家。 谢谢。 

(Applause) 
（掌声）
