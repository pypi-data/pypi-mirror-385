Most people think that new technology or advanced technology can never start in Africa. Instead, they think that the best way to help the continent advance is by providing aid or services that the continent can't provide for itself. So while we see advanced technology like robotics and artificial intelligence growing exponentially in the developed world, those same people are worried that a technologically backward Africa is falling behind. That attitude couldn't be more wrong.
﻿大多数人认为 新科技或先进技术不可能始于非洲 而且他们认为帮助非洲大陆发展的最好方法 是为大陆提供它自身无法自给自足的 帮助或服务 那么当我们看到高科技技术如机器人技术 人工智能技术 在发达国家突飞猛进时 这类人群会开始担忧 科技发展缓慢的非洲会更加落后 这种认知错得离谱
I'm a robotics entrepreneur who's spent a lot of time here in Africa. And in 2014 we created Zipline, which is a company that uses electric autonomous aircraft to deliver medicine to hospitals and health centers on demand. Last year, we launched the world's first automated delivery system operating at national scale. And guess what? We did not do that in the US, we didn't do it in Japan, and we didn't do it in Europe. It was actually President Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Ministry of Health that made a big bet on the potential of this technology and signed a commercial contract to deliver a majority of the country's blood on demand.
我就是一位在非洲从事 机器人技术研发的企业家 在2014年时我们创立Zipline 这是一家使用无人机 来为医院和健康中心运送他们 所需医疗物资的公司 去年我们发启了全球第一支自动运输系统 可在全国范围内运行 猜猜怎么着？ 我们这些科技设施都不是在美国 不是在日本 也不是在欧洲创建完成的 事实上是卢旺达的总理保罗·卡加梅 和卫生部 决定支持这项具有潜力的科技技术 并签署了一份使用这项技术来输送 大部分全国所需血液的商业合同
(Applause)
（掌声）
Yeah, they deserve the applause.
没错，他们值得你们的鼓掌
So why is blood important? Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000 units of blood a year. So this is a product that when you need it, you really, really need it. But blood is also challenging, because it has a very short shelf life, there are lots of different storage requirements, and it's really hard to predict the demand for all of these different blood groups before a patient actually needs something. But the cool thing is that using this technology, Rwanda has been able to keep more blood centralized and then provide it when a patient needs something to any hospital or health center in an average of just 20 or 30 minutes. Do you guys want to see how it works?
那么为什么血液这么重要？ 卢旺达每年都会采集6万至8万单位血液 所以血液是一种当你需要的时候 真的非常需要的一种产品 但血液的保存却并非易事 因为它的活性时效非常短 有许多不同的贮藏要求 而且很难在病人诊断出 实际需要多少血液前 预计出不同血型的血液需求量 而这项技术却能轻松解决这个问题 卢旺达已经能够集中采集更多的血液 并将它送往需要该型血液的任意医院及健康中心 平均送达时间只需要25至30分钟 你们想看看这个系统是怎么操作的吗？
(Audience) Yes.
（观众）想看
All right. Nobody believes me, so ... better to show.
好吧，反正没人相信，还是...直接展示出来更好
This is our distribution center, which is about 20 kilometers outside of Kigali. This actually used to be a cornfield nine months ago, and with the Rwandan government, we leveled it and built this center in a couple weeks. So when a patient is having an emergency, a doctor or a nurse at that hospital can send us a WhatsApp, telling us what they need. And then our team will immediately spring into action. We pull the blood from our stock, which is delivered from the National Center for Blood Transfusion; we scan the blood into our system so the Ministry of Health knows where the blood is going; and then we'll basically pack it into a Zip, which is what we call these little autonomous airplanes that run on batteries. And then once that Zip is ready to go, we accelerate it from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in about half of a second.
这就是我们的分配中心 距离基加利20千米左右 九个月前那里曾是一片玉米田 在与卢旺达政府的共同努力下 几个月内我们就将它改造升级成了现在这个分配中心 所以当病人发生紧急情况时 在那家医院任职的医生或护士可以发WhatsApp短信给我们 告知我们他们需要什么 然后我们的工作人员会立马投入运输作业 我们的工作人员将从库存中找出该型血液 这些血液是由国家输血中心送来的 我们会将找出的血液扫描到我们的系统中 这样卢旺达卫生部就能知道这些血液的去向 然后我们会把该血液打包装进Zip里 也就是我们所叫的小型无人机 这些无人机使用电池供电 一旦Zip准备好出发 我们就会在半秒内 将它从静止加速至时速100千米每小时
(Audience) Whoa!
（观众）哇喔！
And from the moment it leaves the end of the launcher, it's completely autonomous.
从它离开发射器的瞬间开始 这种小型飞行器就是全自动的了
(Video: Air traffic controller directs traffic)
（视频：航空管制员指挥交通运行）
This is our air traffic controller calling it in to Kigali International Airport. And when the Zip arrives at the hospital, it descends to about 30 feet and drops the package. We use a really simple paper parachute -- simple things are best -- that allows the package to come to the ground gently and reliably in the same place every time. So it's just like ride sharing; the doctors get a text message one minute before we arrive, saying, "Walk outside and receive your delivery."
这就是我们的航空管制员 正向基加利国际机场做汇报 当Zip到达提出请求的医院时 它会降落至30英尺的地方并投下血液包 我们用的是很简易的纸质降落伞， 简洁至上 这样才能使得每次血液包着地时 都轻柔无损坏 这个系统类似于共乘形式； 医生们会在我们抵达前一分钟收到短信 “请出来接收包裹”
(Laughter)
（笑声）
And then --
然后 --
(Applause)
（掌声）
and then the doctors have what they need to save a patient's life.
然后医生们就拿到了救助病人所需的物资
This is actually watching a delivery happen from our distribution center; this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away. We're able to watch the vehicle as it makes a delivery at a hospital in real time. You may have noticed there are pings that are coming off of that vehicle on the screen. Those pings are actually data packets that we're getting over the cell phone networks. So these planes have SIM cards just like your cell phone does, and they're communicating over the cell network to tell us where they are and how they're doing at all times. Believe it or not, we actually buy family plans --
这是我们分配中心的实况跟踪 这辆车在大概50千米远处 我们可以看到这辆车在一家医院进行运输作业的 实际情况 或许你们已经注意到了 有一些 实际上那些砰砰声是我们的数据包 我们通过手机网络获得的数据包 所以这些无人机和手机一样都装有SIM卡 通过电话通信网络来接收发送信息 告知我们它们目前在哪里，作业情况如何 不管你们信不信，我们买的是家庭电话套餐
(Laughter)
（笑声）
for this fleet of vehicles, because that's how we get the best rates.
-- 为这只无人机运输队 因为那样我们能得到最实惠的价格
(Laughter)
（笑声）
It's actually not a joke.
我说真的 不是笑话哦
(Laughter)
（笑声）
So today, we're delivering about 20 percent of the national blood supply of Rwanda outside of Kigali. We serve about 12 hospitals, and we're adding hospitals to that network at an accelerating rate. All of those hospitals only receive blood in this way, and most of those hospitals actually place multiple orders every day.
那么目前， 除了基加利 我们还承担了运输卢旺达全国血液供给总量20%的任务 我们现为12家医院提供这项服务 并且加入我们运输系统的医院数量正不断增加 这些医院只能通过这个渠道获得血液供给 而且事实上它们中的大部分每天都会多次要求血液补给
So the reason -- in all of health care logistics, you're always trading off waste against access. So if you want to solve waste, you keep everything centralized. As a result, when patients are having emergencies, sometimes they don't have the medical product they need. If you want to solve access, you stock a lot of medicine at the last mile, at hospitals or health centers, and then patients have the medicine they need. But you end up throwing a lot of medicine out, which is very expensive. What's so amazing is that the Rwandan government has been able to break this cycle permanently. Because doctors can get what they need instantly, they actually stock less blood at the hospitals. So although use of blood products has increased substantially at all the hospitals we serve, in the last nine months, zero units of blood have expired at any of these hospitals.
至于原因嘛 -- 在所有的医疗后勤中 大家总是宁愿浪费资源来换取获取资源的途径 那么若想解决浪费的问题，就需要把所有资源都收集集中起来 这样做的结果就是，当病人遇到紧急情况时 有时病人得不到他们所需要的医疗物资 若想解决资源途径的问题，就需要在最后阶段才把所有物资都收拢 集中到医院或医疗中心 这样病人们就能得到他们所需要的医疗物资 但是这样的结果就是最后会扔掉很大一部分的物资 这是非常昂贵的代价 令人惊喜的是卢旺达政府已经能够 彻底告别这样陈旧不完善的循环链了 因为医生们可以及时地得到他们需求的医疗物资 实际上他们只在医院里存贮了少量血液 所以尽管血液物资的耗用量在不断增长 我们服务的所有医院都有此现象 在前九个月里，这些医院 没有浪费掉一滴血液资源
(Applause)
（掌声）
That's an amazing result. That's actually not been achieved by any other health care system on the planet, and it happened here. But obviously, when we're talking about delivering medical products instantly, the most important thing is patients.
这是个了不起的结果 而这是全球其它任何医疗健康系统 都无法企及的 但在这里却实现了 当然当我们谈论及时运送医疗产品时 最重要的对象还是病患
Let me give you an example. A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother came into one of the hospitals that we serve, and she gave birth via C-section. But that led to complications, and she started to bleed. Luckily, the doctors had some blood of her blood type on hand that had been delivered via Zipline's routine service, and so they transfused her with a couple units of blood. But she bled out of those units in about 10 minutes. In this case, that mother's life is in grave danger -- in any hospital in the world. But luckily, the doctors who were taking care of her immediately called our distribution center, they placed an emergency order, and our team actually did emergency delivery after emergency delivery after emergency delivery. They ended up sending seven units of red blood cells, four units of plasma and two units of platelets. That's more blood than you have in your entire body. All of it was transfused into her, the doctors were able to stabilize her, and she is healthy today.
举个例子来说吧 几个月前，一位24岁的母亲来到了 一家我们服务的医院 她是来做剖腹产的 但是手术过程中发生了并发症，她开始大出血 幸运的是，医生们手上有一些符合这位母亲的血型的血液 这些血液就是之前通过Zipline运输服务运送过去的 医生们就给她输了几个单位的血液 但是这母亲在10分钟左右后就输完了这些血液 在这案例中，那位母亲的生命受到了极大的威胁 -- 在全世界任何一家医院都是这样的 然后非常幸运的是，这些治疗她的医生们 立即联系了我们的分配中心 要求了紧急运输服务 我们的团队进行了一次又一次 一次又一次的紧急运输 他们最终发送了7个单位的红细胞 4个单位的血浆 2个单位的血小板 这比你全身的血液都要多 这些血浆、红细胞、血小板被输给她 医生稳定了她的病情 她现在已经恢复健康了
(Applause)
（掌声）
Since we launched, we've done about 400 emergency deliveries like that, and there's a story like that one behind most of those emergencies. Here are just a couple of the moms who have received transfusions in this way in the last couple months. We're always reminded: when we can help a doctor save a mom's life, it's not just her life that you're saving. That's also a baby boy or a baby girl who has a mother while they're growing up.
从我们开工以来，我们已经进行了大约400次这样的紧急运输 大部分紧急运输背后都有一个这样的故事 这里是通过这样的方式接受输血的 母亲中的一部分 在过去的几个月里 我们一直在被提醒：在我们帮助医生拯救一位母亲的生命的时候 我们拯救的不仅仅是她一个人的生命 同时我们也救了一个男宝宝或女宝宝 他们成长的过程中有妈妈陪伴
(Applause)
（掌声）
But I want to be clear: postpartum hemorrhaging -- it's not a Rwanda problem, it's not a developing-world problem -- this is a global problem. Maternal health is a challenge everywhere. The main difference is that Rwanda was the first country to use radical technology to do something about it. And that's the reason this attitude of Africa being disrupted or advanced technology not working here or needing aid is so totally wrong. Africa can be the disrupter. These small, agile, developing economies can out-innovate large, rich ones. And they can totally leapfrog over the absence of legacy infrastructure to go straight to newer and better systems.
但是我想强调的一点是： 产后出血--这不仅仅是卢旺达有的问题 也不是发展中国家才有的问题 这是一个全球都要面临的问题 （如何确保）产妇的健康在哪都是一个挑战 最主要的不同是，卢旺达是第一个 运用颠覆性科技来解决这个问题的国家 这就是为什么“非洲很混乱” “先进科技在这里没有用” “这里需要援助” 这些观点都是错的 非洲也可以是颠覆者 这些小而灵活、发展中的经济体，能超越庞大而富有的经济体 而且他们完全可以跳过基础设施缺乏的问题 直接发展更好、更新的系统
In 2000, if you had said that high-quality cellular networks were about to roll out across all of Africa, people would have told you that you were crazy. And yet, no one anticipated how fast those networks were going to connect and empower people. Today, 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya flows through M-Pesa, their mobile payment platform. And not only that, but our autonomous fleet of vehicles relies on that cellular network. Over the next few years as we start serving private health care facilities, we'll also use that mobile payment platform to collect fees for deliveries. So innovation leads to more innovation leads to more innovation. And meanwhile, most people who live in developed economies think that drone delivery is technologically impossible, let alone happening at national scale in East Africa. And I do mean East Africa, not just Rwanda.
在2000年 如果你说蜂窝网将会在 非洲大陆全面铺开 人们会说你疯了 然而，没有人预料到 这些网络连接人们的速度会有多快 今天，肯尼亚GDP的44%流经M-Pesa 一种移动支付软件 不止于此 我们的无人机队也依赖于蜂窝网 在将来的几年里，当我们开始提供私人医疗服务时 我们也将使用移动支付平台 来收取运输费用 所以创新将引领更多的创新 同时 在发达国家生活的大多数人 认为无人机运输在技术上是不可能实现的 更不用说是在东非的一个国家范围内进行了 我说的是东非，不仅仅是卢旺达
On Thursday, just a couple days ago, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced that they are going to use this same technology to provide instant delivery of a wide range of medical products to 10 million of the hardest to reach people in the country.
在周四，几天之前 坦桑尼亚卫生部宣布 他们也将使用这种技术 为全国范围内最难获得医疗物资的1000万人民 提供大量医疗物资的运输服务
(Applause)
（掌声）
It's actually going to be the largest autonomous system anywhere in the world.
这将是全世界最大的无人机网络
To give you a sense of what this looks like, this is one of the first distribution centers. You can see a 75-kilometer service radius around the distribution center, and that allows us to serve hundreds of health facilities and hospitals, all of which are rural, from that single distribution center. But to serve over 20 percent of the population of Tanzania, we're going to need multiple distribution centers. We'll actually need four. And from these distribution centers, we expect to be doing several hundred lifesaving deliveries every day, and this system will ultimately serve over 1,000 health facilities and hospitals in the country. So yeah, East Africa is moving really fast.
这是什么概念呢 这是其中一个配送中心 你可以看到配送中心半径75千米内的一个圆 这让我们能够为数百家健康中心和医院提供服务 所有的这些都在乡村里 从这一个配送中心 能够服务超过20%的坦桑尼亚人口 我们需要更多的配送中心 事实上我们需要4个 从这些配送中心 我们希望每天进行数百次拯救生命的配送 这个系统最终将支持在乡村的超过1000家 医疗中心和医院 所以，东非正在飞快的行动
One thing that people, I think, often miss is that these kinds of leaps generate compounding gains. For example, Rwanda, by investing in this infrastructure for health care, now has an aerial logistics network that they can use to catalyze other parts of their economy, like agriculture or e-commerce. Even more importantly, 100 percent of the teams we hire at these distribution centers are local. So here's our Rwandan team, which is a group of extraordinary engineers and operators. They run the world's only automated delivery system operating at national scale. They have been able to master something that the largest technology companies in the world have not yet been able to figure out. So they are total heroes.
我想，人们常常忽略的一点是 这种进步产生了复合的增益 例如，卢旺达在发展了这项医疗基础设施后 他们现在有了可以使用的空中物流网络 可借此促进其他方面的发展 例如农业或电子商业的发展 更重要的是 在这些配送中心里工作的所有人都是本地人 这就是我们卢旺达的队伍 队伍里全是出色的工程师和接线员 他们运行着世界上唯一一个 在全国范围内运行的自动配送系统 他们已经能够操纵 世界上最大的科技公司 都没能做出来的东西 所以他们绝对是英雄
(Applause)
（掌声）
They're total heroes.
他们绝对是英雄
Our team's mission is to deliver basic access to medicine to all seven billion people on the planet, no matter how hard it is to reach them. We often tell people about that mission, and they say, "That's so generous of you, it's so philanthropic." No! Philanthropy has nothing to do with it. Because of the commercial contracts that we sign with ministries of health, these networks are 100 percent sustainable and scalable. And the reason we feel so strongly about correcting that misperception is that entrepreneurship is the only force in human history that has lifted millions of people out of poverty.
我们团队的目标是把医疗物资传送给 地球上的70亿人民 不管有多困难 我们经常跟人们说起这个目标 他们说：“你们真慷慨，这相当慈善。” 不！ 这跟慈善根本没有关系 因为我们和卫生部签订的商业合同 这些网络是100%可持续和可拓展的 而我们之所以如此强烈的更正这个误解 是因为企业家的职能是人类历史上 让成千上万的人民摆脱贫穷的唯一推动力
(Applause)
（掌声）
No amount of foreign aid is going to sustainably employ 250 million African youth. And the jobs that these kids may have gotten 10 years ago are largely being automated or are being changed dramatically by technology. So they are looking for new skill sets, new competitive advantages. They're looking for start-ups. So why aren't there more start-ups that are tackling these global problems that are faced by billions of people in developing economies? The reason is that investors and entrepreneurs are totally blind to the opportunity. We think these problems are the domain of NGOs or governments, not private companies. That's what we have to change.
没有多少外国援助能一直雇佣 2500万的非洲年轻人 而这些年轻人在十年前可能获得的工作 现在已经大部分自动化了 或者被科技急剧的改变了 所以他们在寻找新的技能 新的竞争优势 他们在寻找新兴公司 所以为什么我们不创立更多的新兴公司 来处理发展中国家成千上万的人民面对的国际问题呢？ 原因是投资者和企业家完全忽视了 这些机会 我们认为这些问题是非政府组织或政府需要考虑的 不是私人公司 这就是我们需要改变的地方
You may have noticed I left something out of the video that I showed you. I didn't show you how the planes land when they get back to the distribution center. So, it might be obvious to you: none of our planes have landing gear. We also don't have runways where we operate. So we have to be able to decelerate the plane from about 100 kilometers an hour to zero in half of a second. And the way we do that is we actually use a wire that tracks that plane as it comes in, with centimeter-level accuracy. We snag the plane out of the sky, and then we gently plop it onto an actively inflated cushion. This is basically a combination of an aircraft carrier and a bouncy castle.
你也许注意到了我在视频中 略去了一些东西 我没有展示当飞机回到配送中心的时候 他们是怎么降落的 所以，这可能很显然了： 我们的飞机没有降落装置 在我们操作的地方也没有跑道 所以我们要能使飞机在半秒的时间内 从约100km每小时的速度减速到0 我们的方法是： 我们用一根线在飞机到达的时候绊住它 在厘米量级的精度内 我们在空中绊住飞机 然后轻轻地使它掉在充气垫子上 这基本上是一个航空母舰
(Laughter)
和堡垒的组合体
So let me show you.
（笑声）
(Laughter)
让我展示给你们看一下
(Applause)
（笑声）
And it might be obvious to you why I wanted to end with this video. I wanted to show you the kids and the teenagers who line up on the fence every day. They cheer every launch and every landing.
（掌声） 所以为什么我想用这个视频结尾就很显然了 我想给你们看看这些在每天栅栏旁排着队的 孩子们和青少年们
(Laughter)
他们为每一次发射和降落欢呼庆祝
(Applause)
（笑声）
Sometimes I actually show up at the distribution center early because I'm jet-lagged. I'll show up an hour before we begin operation. And there will be kids on the fence getting good seats.
（掌声） 有时候我会很早到达运输中心 因为我受时差影响 我会在我们开始操作前1小时就到达
(Laughter)
那儿已经有孩子们在栅栏旁占座了
And you go up and you ask them, "What do you think about the planes?" And they'll say, "Oh, it's a sky ambulance." So they get it. I mean, they get it more than most adults.
（笑声） 然后我走过去问他们 “你们觉得这些飞机怎么样” 他们会说：“噢，这是飞行急救车。” 所以他们懂了。
So I was asking earlier: Who is going to be creating the disruptive technology companies of Africa over the next decade? Ultimately, it's going to be up to these kids. They are the engineers of Rwanda and Africa. They are the engineers of our shared future. But the only way they can build that future is if we realize that world-changing companies can scale in Africa, and that disruptive technology can start here first.
我指的是，他们比大多数成年人都了解了更多 所以我之前提出问题： 谁将会在接下来的十年 创造非洲颠覆性的科技公司？ 毫无疑问的，将会是这些孩子们 他们将会是卢旺达和非洲的工程师 他们将会是我们共同未来里的工程师 但是他们实现那样的未来的唯一途径是 我们认识到改变世界的公司能在非洲创立
Thanks.
颠覆性的科技能最先在非洲开始
(Applause)
谢谢！ （掌声）
