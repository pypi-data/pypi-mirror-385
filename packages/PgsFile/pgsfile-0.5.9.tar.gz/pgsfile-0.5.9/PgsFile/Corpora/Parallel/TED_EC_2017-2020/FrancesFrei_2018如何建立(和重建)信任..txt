I want to talk to you about how to build and rebuild trust, because it's my belief that trust is the foundation for everything we do, and that if we can learn to trust one another more, we can have unprecedented human progress.
﻿我想跟大家谈谈 如何建立和重建信任， 因为我相信：信任 是我们做一切事情的基础， 如果我们学着彼此之间多一些信任， 人类将能取得前所未有的进步。
But what if trust is broken? What if your CEO is caught on video, disparaging an employee? What if your employees experience a culture of bias, exclusion and worse? What if there's a data breach, and it feels an awful lot like a cover-up than seriously addressing it? And most tragically, what if a technological fail leads to the loss of human life?
可如果人与人间信任破裂了呢？ 假如你的CEO被拍到在贬低一名员工； 假如你的员工感受到的是一种 充满偏见、排挤或更糟糕的企业文化； 假如发生了数据泄露， 但相应的处理更像在掩盖， 而不是认真想法解决； 而最不幸的是， 假如技术上的失误最终致人死亡， 当上述情况发生，该怎么办？
If I was giving this talk six months ago, I would have been wearing an Uber T-shirt. I'm a Harvard Business School professor, but I was super attracted to going to an organization that was metaphorically and perhaps quite literally on fire. I had read everything that was written in the newspaper, and that was precisely what drew me to the organization. This was an organization that had lost trust with every constituent that mattered.
如果我是六个月前做这个演讲， 我可能会穿着 优步（Uber）T恤站在这。 我是哈佛商学院的教授， 不过我超级想去一个组织， 可以比喻成，或许真的是 一个如火中烧的组织。 我读了所有的纸媒报道， 正是那些报道驱使我来到这个组织。 这是一个已经失去了 所有重要成员信任的组织。
But there's a word about me that I should share. My favorite trait is redemption. I believe that there is a better version of us around every corner, and I have seen firsthand how organizations and communities and individuals change at breathtaking speed.
不过关于我自己， 有一个词必须得分享。 我最喜欢的个人特质是拯救。 我相信，在每一个转角， 我们都能遇见更好的自己， 我也曾亲眼目睹 机构、团体， 以及个人如何以惊人的速度改变。
I went to Uber with the hopes that a turnaround there could give license to the rest of us who might have narrower versions of their challenges. But when I got to Uber, I made a really big mistake. I publicly committed to wearing an Uber T-shirt every day until every other employee was wearing an Uber T-shirt. I had clearly not thought that through.
我满怀期待来到优步， 希望优步能扭转现状， 得以缩小我们这些人 可能面临的挑战范围。 但到优步后， 我犯了一个大错误。 我公开承诺每天穿优步T恤， 直到所有员工都穿上为止。 很显然我太冲动了。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
It was 250 days of wearing an Uber T-shirt. Now I am liberated from that commitment, as I am back at HBS, and what I'd like to do is share with you how far I have taken that liberty, which, it's baby steps,
足足穿了 250 天优步T恤。 现在我从那个承诺中解脱了， 因为我又回到了哈佛商学院， 而我想跟各位分享的是 我带着这份自由走了多远， 嗯，也就刚迈出几步吧，
(Laughter)
（笑声）
but I would just say I'm on my way.
不过我只想说， 我总算恢复自由身了。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
Now, trust, if we're going to rebuild it, we have to understand its component parts. The component parts of trust are super well understood. There's three things about trust. If you sense that I am being authentic, you are much more likely to trust me. If you sense that I have real rigor in my logic, you are far more likely to trust me. And if you believe that my empathy is directed towards you, you are far more likely to trust me. When all three of these things are working, we have great trust. But if any one of these three gets shaky, if any one of these three wobbles, trust is threatened.
现在来看信任， 如果我们想重建它， 我们得了解它的构成。 非常好理解。 信任由三部分构成。 第一，真实性。 如果你察觉到我是真实的， 你就会更容易信任我。 第二，逻辑。 如果你认为我的逻辑确实合理, 你就会更容易信任我。 第三，同理心。 如果你相信我和你有共鸣， 你就会更容易信任我。 当三部分都状态正常， 人与人之间会建立很深的信任。 但假如其中任何一部分不稳固， 任何一部分松动了， 信任就会受到威胁。
Now here's what I'd like to do. I want each of us to be able to engender more trust tomorrow, literally tomorrow, than we do today. And the way to do that is to understand where trust wobbles for ourselves and have a ready-made prescription to overcome it. So that's what I would like to do together.
接下来就是我想做的。 我想让每一个人明天， 没错，就是明天， 都能比今天创造更多信任。 做法就是弄清自己的 信任三角哪里出现了松动， 再拿出实用的对策去解决它。 这正是我想和大家一起做的。
Would you give me some sense of whether or not you're here voluntarily?
方便让我知道下， 你们是自愿来这儿的吗？
(Laughter)
（笑声）
Yeah. OK. Alright. Awesome. OK. So --
哇哦，好，不错，非常好。 所以，你们——
(Laughter)
（笑声）
it's just super helpful feedback.
你们的反馈太给力了。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
So the most common wobble is empathy. The most common wobble is that people just don't believe that we're mostly in it for them, and they believe that we're too self-distracted. And it's no wonder. We are all so busy with so many demands on our time, it's easy to crowd out the time and space that empathy requires. For Dylan to be Dylan, that takes real time. And for us, if we have too much to do, we may not have that time. But that puts us into a vicious cycle, because without revealing empathy, it makes everything harder. Without the benefit of the doubt of trust, it makes everything harder, and then we have less and less time for empathy, and so it goes.
那么，最常见的是同理心的松动。 这种最常见的松动 是指人们总不相信 我们通常是跟他们站在一边的， 他们认为我们总是被自己扰乱。 这不奇怪。 我们终日奔忙，分秒必争， 很容易就挤掉同理心所需要的 时间和空间。 迪伦成为迪伦需要花费时间， 而如果我们有太多事要忙， 我们可能就没有那个时间。 但那会令我们陷入一个恶性循环， 因为没有表现出同理心， 每件事都更困难。 没有了“暂且信任你”， 每件事都更困难， 然后留给同理心的时间 就愈发减少，这样周而复始。
So here's the prescription: identify where, when and to whom you are likely to offer your distraction. That should trace pretty perfectly to when, where and to whom you are likely to withhold your empathy. And if in those instances, we can come up with a trigger that gets us to look up, look at the people right in front of us, listen to them, deeply immerse ourselves in their perspectives, then we have a chance of having a sturdy leg of empathy. And if you do nothing else, please put away your cell phone. It is the largest distraction magnet yet to be made, and it is super difficult to create empathy and trust in its presence. That takes care of the empathy wobblers.
怎么办，方法在这里： 确定在何时、何地、对谁 你想要匀出自己的部分精力。 那一定能非常精确地跟踪到 你可能会在何时、何地、对谁 隐藏自己的同理心。 一旦遇到这些情况， 采用这个方法， 我们就会像碰到触发器一样， 它促使我们抬起头， 看看面前的人， 听听他们在说什么， 认真换位思考， 这样我们就能获得信任三角中 牢固的一边：同理心。 如果你做不了别的， 那请先把手机收起来。 手机是迄今为止制造出来的 最会使人们分心的东西， 它的存在使得同理心 和信任的产生异常困难。 它控制住了那些同理心松动的人。
Logic wobbles can come in two forms. It's either the quality of your logic or it's your ability to communicate the logic. Now if the quality of your logic is at risk, I can't really help you with that.
逻辑松动有两种形式： 一种体现在逻辑能力上， 另一种体现在表达逻辑的能力上。 如果你的逻辑能力不行， 那我真的无能为力。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
It's like, not in this much time.
至少在这么短时间内不行。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
But fortunately, it's often the case that our logic is sound, but it's our ability to communicate the logic that is in jeopardy. Super fortunately, there's a very easy fix to this. If we consider that there are two ways to communicate in the world, and Harvard Business School professors are known for two-by-twos -- nonsense, it's the triangle that rocks.
不过幸运的是， 通常我们的逻辑都是正常的， 但是表达逻辑的能力有问题。 万幸的是， 这有一个简单的解决方法。 如果我们认为世界上有两种表达方式， 而哈佛商学院教授 以2乘2方式闻名—— 瞎说，三角形才是最棒的。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
If we consider that there are two ways to communicate in the world, and the first one is when you take us on a journey, a magnificent journey that has twists and turns and mystery and drama, until you ultimately get to the point, and some of the best communicators in the world communicate just like this. But if you have a logic wobble, this can be super dangerous. So instead, I implore you, start with your point in a crisp half-sentence, and then give your supporting evidence. This means that people will be able to get access to our awesome ideas, and just as importantly, if you get cut off before you're done ... ladies --
如果我们认为世界上 有两种表达方式， 第一种就像你带我们去旅行， 一次华丽的旅行， 沿途有盘旋，有转弯 有神秘莫测，有戏剧性的转变， 终于你言归正传了， 世界上一些最棒的交流者， 就是这样与人交流的。 可如果你有逻辑松动， 这样做就非常危险。 所以，相反，我恳请各位， 一开始你就要用 干脆利落的半句话点明主题， 接着再给出你的支持证据。 这样做意味着别人能够接触到 我们那些超棒的点子， 同样重要的是， 即使在结束前就被打断—— 就像这样，女士们 （没说先生们）——
(Laughter)
（笑声）
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
If you get cut off before you're done, you still get credit for the idea, as opposed to someone else coming in and snatching it from you.
即使还没结束你就被打断， 你仍会因为这个点子得到称赞， 而不是有哪个人突然闯进来 抢走你的这个点子。
(Applause)
（鼓掌）
You just gave me goosebumps.
你们让我有点受宠若惊。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
The third wobble is authenticity, and I find it to be the most vexing. We as a human species can sniff out in a moment, literally in a moment, whether or not someone is being their authentic true self. So in many ways, the prescription is clear. You don't want to have an authenticity wobble? Be you. Great. And that is super easy to do when you're around people who are like you. But if you represent any sort of difference, the prescription to "be you" can be super challenging.
第三种是真实性出现松动， 我发现这是最让人头疼的。 我们人类在一瞬间， 真的就是一瞬间， 就能判断出一个人 表现出的是否是真实的自我。 既然这样，从很多方面来看， 解决方法也很明确。 你不想出现真实性松动，是不是？ 那就“做自己”吧。 很好。 当周围都是和你类似的人， “做自己”非常容易。 但假如你表现出 任何一种与众不同， “做自己”就相当有难度。
I have been tempted at every step of my career, tempted personally and tempted by coaching of others, to mute who I am in the world. I'm a woman of super strong opinions, with really deep convictions, direct speech. I have a magnificent wife, and together, we have such crazy ambition. I prefer men's clothes and comfortable shoes. Thank you, Allbirds.
在事业生涯的每一步， 我都曾经被诱惑， 被个人和他人的指导诱惑， 想要弱化自己的身份。 我是一个相当有主见的女人， 信念坚定， 说话直接了当。 我有一位出色的妻子， 在一起我们会有非常疯狂的追求。 我喜欢穿男式衣服 和舒适的鞋子。 谢谢 Allbirds（鞋品牌）。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
In some contexts, this makes me different. I hope that each person here has the beautiful luxury of representing difference in some context in your life. But with that privilege comes a very sincere temptation to hold back who we are, and if we hold back who we are, we're less likely to be trusted. And if we're less likely to be trusted, we're less likely to be given stretch assignments. And without those stretch assignments, we're less likely to get promoted, and so on and so on until we are super depressed by the demographic tendencies of our senior leadership.
在某些场合，这让我与众不同。 我希望在座每一位 都能拥有在人生的某些时候 表现自己独特一面的奢侈享受。 但是这种荣幸 会带来一种非常实在的诱惑 并掩盖住我们的真实一面， 而如果我们隐藏真实的自己， 我们就不容易被信任。 如果不容易被信任， 我们也不大可能得到额外任务。 而没有那些额外任务， 我们也就不大可能得到晋升， 如此反复， 直到高层领导的年龄分布趋势 让我们沮丧不已。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
And it all comes back to our being our authentic selves.
最后再回到“做真实的自己”。
So here's my advice. Wear whatever makes you feel fabulous. Pay less attention to what you think people want to hear from you and far more attention to what your authentic, awesome self needs to say. And to the leaders in the room, it is your obligation to set the conditions that not only make it safe for us to be authentic but make it welcome, make it celebrated, cherish it for exactly what it is, which is the key for us achieving greater excellence than we have ever known is possible.
那我的建议就是： 穿戴上任何让你感觉超棒的衣物。 少去在意你觉得 别人想从你这听到什么， 更多的去关注真实的、超棒的自己 需要表达出的那些东西。 还有这个屋里的领导者， 你们有义务去创造条件， 在这种条件下， “做真实的自己”不仅是安全的 也是受到欢迎 和可以庆祝的， 珍惜事物本来的样子， 这是我们成功的关键， 让我们有可能到达 未曾了解的更高巅峰。
So let's go back to Uber. What happened at Uber? When I got there, Uber was wobbling all over the place. Empathy, logic, authenticity were all wobbling like crazy. But we were able to find super effective, super quick fixes for two of the wobbles.
让我们再回到优步。 优步发生了什么？ 当我来到优步时， 它到处都在动荡不安。 同理心、逻辑、真实性 都在疯狂动摇。 不过对其中两种松动， 我们有能力找到极其快速有效的对策。
I'll give you an illustration of empathy. In the meetings at Uber, it was not uncommon for people to be texting one another ... about the meeting.
先来说下同理心。 在优步的内部会议上， 常见到人们互相发短信—— 讨论会议内容。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
I had never seen anything like it.
我还从没见过这样的。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
It may have done many things, but it did not create a safe, empathetic environment. The solution though, super clear: technology, off and away. And that forced people to look up, to look at the people in front of them, to listen to them, to immerse themselves in their perspectives and to collaborate in unprecedented ways.
这样做可能会完成很多工作， 但不能创造一种安全的、 有同理心的环境。 不过解决方案却是相当清楚明了： 关掉手机，远离科技。 这会迫使人们抬头看， 看看眼前的人， 听听他们在说什么， 认真的换位思考， 用前所未有的方式共同协作。
Logic was equally wobbly, and this was because the hypergrowth of the organization meant that people, managers were getting promoted again and again and again. Soon, they were put in positions that they had no business being in. Their positions outstripped their capability, and it was not their fault. The solution: a massive influx of executive education that focused specifically on logic, on strategy and leadership. It gave people the rigor of the quality of their logic, and it turned a whole lot of triangles, right-side up, so people were able to communicate effectively with one another.
逻辑也同样在松动， 这是因为优步的飞速扩张 意味着员工和经理 能一次，一次，又一次的 得到晋升。 很快，他们被放到不相干的职位上。 而他们的能力无法胜任所在的职位， 不过这不是他们的错。 解决方案：引入大量高管教育项目， 专门针对逻辑、 策略以及领导能力进行培训。 它会让人形成严谨的逻辑， 并扭转许多倾斜的三角形， 让它们回归正位， 这样人们就有能力实现 彼此间的有效沟通。
The last one, authenticity, I'll say it's still mighty wobbly, but honestly, that doesn't make Uber very different from all of the other companies I've seen in Silicon Valley and beyond. It is still much easier to coach people to fit in. It is still much easier to reward people when they say something that you were going to say, as opposed to rewarding people when they say something entirely different than what you were going to say. But when we figure out this, when we figure out how to celebrate difference and how to let people bring the best version of themselves forward, well holy cow, is that the world I want my sons to grow up in. And with the collection of people here, it would be a privilege to lock arms with you and go ahead and rebuild trust in every corner of the globe.
最后一个，真实性， 我会说这部分还是松动的很厉害。 不过说实话， 优步并没有因此 与我见过的硅谷和硅谷之外的 其他公司产生太大差别。 相比之下，指导人们 去调整适应还是更容易些。 当有人说出你想说的话， 你去奖励他们， 这比当有人说出 与你想说的不一样的话 你还要去奖励他们要容易多了。 但是当我们弄清楚这些， 弄清楚如何赞扬差异， 如何让人们发掘出自己的最好一面， 天呐，多希望我的孩子们 也能在这样的世界长大。 今天大家聚在这里， 很荣幸能与你们紧密携手， 共同前进，在世界上 每一个角落重建信任。
Thank you very much.
非常感谢。
(Applause)
