2016年，对中国人民来说，是非凡的一年，也是难忘的一年，
For the Chinese people, the year of 2016 is not only outstanding but also unforgettable.
“十三五”实现了开门红。
We made a good start of the 13th 5-year National Development Period which spans from 2016 to 2020.

We vigorously pushed forward the exercise of our Party's strict governance in every respect, unswervingly cracked down on both "tigers" and "flies", in a bid to purify our political ecosystem, and continue to improve our Party and our government's working style, as well as our social conduct.
2016年，“中国天眼”落成启用，“悟空”号已在轨运行一年，“墨子号”飞向太空，神舟十一号和天宫二号遨游星汉，中国奥运健儿勇创佳绩，中国女排时隔12年再次登上奥运会最高领奖台......

Furthermore, our reform measures have made it a little easier for rural migrant workers to settle down in urban areas, and the condition for many children from impoverished areas to receive education has also improved, people don't need to shuttle back and forth between different places when they apply for an identity card in non-native places, some people without permanent household residence for a long time can finally get access to social welfare, many people even have got their own family doctors, and "river chiefs" will be appointed across China for better protection of water resources against pollution in the country.
这一切，让我们感到欣慰。
All those efforts make us feel a sense of achievement.

We have adhered to the peaceful development while resolutely safeguarding the territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests of China.
谁要在这个问题上做文章，中国人民决不答应！
We will never tolerate any act that undermines our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.
这一年，多地发生的自然灾害和安全事故，给人民生命财产和生产生活造成严重损失，

天上不会掉馅饼，
No fruit will be reaped without hard work.
努力奋斗才能梦想成真。

We will make sure that no one is left behind on our way to prosperity.
一年来，又有1000多万贫困人口实现了脱贫，

新年之际，我最牵挂的还是困难群众，
As we greet the New Year, there is one thing that remains most dearly attached to my heart.

That is those fellow citizens who still live in hardship.
他们吃得怎么样、住得怎么样，能不能过好新年、过好春节。
I'm seriously concerned and wonder how their food supply and accommodation are being maintained, how they are celebrating the New Year and the Spring Festival.
我也了解，部分群众在就业、子女教育、就医、住房等方面还面临一些困难，
I'm aware that some folks are faced with difficulties in employment, children's education, medical care and housing.
不断解决好这些问题是党和政府义不容辞的责任。
To ceaselessly solve those problems remain an unshirkable responsibility for the party and the government.
全党全社会要继续关心和帮助贫困人口和有困难的群众，
The whole party and the whole society should show continued care and offer help to those fellow citizens living in poverty.
让改革发展成果惠及更多群众，让人民生活更加幸福美满。
We will enable more people to enjoy the fruit of our reforms, and ultimately let all the people in this country live in happiness.
上下同欲者胜。
As one saying goes, "success comes to those who share in one purpose".
只要我们13亿多人民和衷共济，只要我们党永远同人民站在一起，大家撸起袖子加油干，我们就一定能够走好我们这一代人的长征路。
So long as the 1.3 billion people pull together in forging ahead, the party stands identified with the people, and the nation remains mobilized for brand new endeavors, we will surely accomplish the Long March of our generation.
中国人历来主张“世界大同，天下一家”。
The Chinese people have always believed that the world is a commonwealth.
中国人民不仅希望自己过得好，也希望各国人民过得好。
We Chinese not only aspire for good living for ourselves, but also hope people in other parts of the world lead a descent life.
当前，战乱和贫困依然困扰着部分国家和地区，疾病和灾害也时时侵袭着众多的人们。
At present, people in certain countries and regions are still troubled in wars and turbulence; many are suffering from diseases and disasters.
我真诚希望，国际社会携起手来，秉持人类命运共同体的理念，把我们这个星球建设得更加和平、更加繁荣。
We sincerely hope the international community will make concerted effort, work in the belief that mankind shares the same fate as a community, and build our planet into a more peaceful and prosperous place to live in.
让我们满怀信心和期待，一起迎接新年的钟声！
May the chime of the New Year consolidate our confidence and re-ignite our aspiration for an even better tomorrow!
谢谢大家。
