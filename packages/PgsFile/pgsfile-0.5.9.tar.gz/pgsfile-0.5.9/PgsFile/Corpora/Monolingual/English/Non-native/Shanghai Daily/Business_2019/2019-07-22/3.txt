Query on agriculture products 
2019-07-22
SOME Chinese enterprises have inquired with US exporters about the purchase of agricultural produce and applied for the lifting of tariffs on the products in accordance with the regulations of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, Chinese authorities said yesterday.
The commission will organize experts to evaluate the applications.
China and the United States are implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state during the G20 Osaka summit.
The United States recently announced a move to exempt 110 items of Chinese industrial imports from additional tariffs and expressed willingness to encourage US businesses to continue providing supplies for Chinese enterprises. The Chinese enterprises are willing to continue importing certain agricultural products from the United States that are marketable in China.
