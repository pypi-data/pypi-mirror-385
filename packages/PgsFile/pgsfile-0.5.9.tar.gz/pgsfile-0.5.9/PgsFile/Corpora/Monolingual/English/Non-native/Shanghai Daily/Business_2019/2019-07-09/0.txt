Car-recall numbers drop 43% 
2019-07-09
China recalled more than 2.75 million defective cars in the first six months of this year, a drop of more than 43 percent compared with the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.
The improvement is largely due to a decrease in defective Takata airbags, which were recalled last year because some exploded when deployed. About 4.92 million cars were recalled in the first half of 2018. 
In terms of countries, German car brands recalled more than 1.8 million vehicles, accounting for nearly 66 percent of the total. 
In terms of new-energy vehicles, Shanghai-based electric car company NIO recalled 4,800 vehicles to replace the battery packs, a first for NEV.
“With rising awareness of domestic automakers and the increasing complexity of products, recalls are becoming more frequent,” said Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association. 
About 50,000 vehicles were recalled in June alone.
