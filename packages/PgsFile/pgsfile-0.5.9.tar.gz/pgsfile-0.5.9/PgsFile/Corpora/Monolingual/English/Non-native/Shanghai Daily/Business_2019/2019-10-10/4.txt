2019-10-10
CHINA'S listed companies are happy with their performance in the third quarter, with 54 percent expecting positive or augmented financial results, the Securities Daily reported yesterday.
As of Tuesday, 513 companies listed on the country’s two stock exchanges had released Q3 estimates ahead of releasing their official quarterly reports before the end of October.
Some 140 companies, or 27 percent, expect marked net profit growth, while 43 loss-making firms forecast turnarounds.
He Nanye, a researcher with the Suning Institute of Finance, attributed the optimism to the country’s tax cuts, pro-growth policies and economic resilience.
“The firms’ sound momentum is expected to continue in Q4, as China’s economy maintains its steady growth,” He said.
