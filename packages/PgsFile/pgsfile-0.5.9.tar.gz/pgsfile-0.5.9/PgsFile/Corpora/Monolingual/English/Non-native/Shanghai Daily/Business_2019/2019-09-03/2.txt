2019-09-03
Shanghai’s new housing market rebounded in August, indicating recovered sentiment among buyers.
Citywide, a total of around 776,000 square meters of new residential properties, excluding government-subsidized affordable housing, were sold last month, an increase of 26 percent from July, according to Shanghai Centaline Property Consultants Co.
“Buying sentiment really started to pick up since the second half of August mainly in outlying Fengxian District and the Nanhui area in the Pudong New Area,” said Lu Wenxi, Centaline’s senior research manager. “As a result, the average price of new homes fell accordingly due to a structural shift.”
Fengxian, where three projects made it into last month’s top 10 list by area, led the local market with monthly sales of 128,000 square meters, according to Centaline data.
Notably, a development in Nanhui topped August’s list after selling 22,172 square meters, or 244 units, for an average price of 26,248 yuan (US$3,657) per square meter.
It was followed by a project in Fengxian which saw 21,311 square meters, or 112 units, sold at an average of 34,993 yuan per square meters.
