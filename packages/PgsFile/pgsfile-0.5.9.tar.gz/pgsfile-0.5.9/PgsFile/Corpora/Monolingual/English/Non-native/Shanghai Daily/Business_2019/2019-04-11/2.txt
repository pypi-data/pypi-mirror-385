New center to help firms in Yangtze Delta 
2019-04-11
A NEW market service center for high-tech companies in the Yangtze River Delta region officially started operations yesterday.
The center, established in November in the Pudong New Area, is an incubator aimed at helping emerging tech startups in the region go public on a new local science and technology innovation board.
Since its establishment, the center has organized talks and seminars to assess science and innovation enterprises in the delta, including their plans to go public.
For those qualified to list on the new board, which has simpler requirements than the main exchange, the center offers a range of services related to listing, equity investment, financing, fundraising and risk management.
So far, 57 companies have applied to list on the board, which has not set a launch date. The board will be managed by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Twelve cities in the delta from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, as well as a number of legal and accounting firms, have signed agreements to participate in the center.
