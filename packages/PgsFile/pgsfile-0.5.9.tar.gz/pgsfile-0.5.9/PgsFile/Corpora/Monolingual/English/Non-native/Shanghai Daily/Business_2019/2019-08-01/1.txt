Coke shifts from HK to Shanghai 
2019-08-01
Swire Coca-Cola is to move its Chinese headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai’s Pudong New Area.
The company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong conglomerate Swire Pacific Ltd, is one of the largest bottlers of Coca-Cola globally. In 2018, it sold 1.6 billion boxes of drinks and recorded sales of HK$40 billion (US$5 billion). It chose Pudong to better expand the domestic market by bringing more investment and deepening cooperation.
Pudong, a pioneer in China’s reform and opening-up policy, will show its strong support by offering convenient and efficient services. It will also encourage the company to take part in the development of the free trade zone and support the city’s ambition to become a global innovation hub.
In the first half of 2019, Pudong saw US$4.22 billion of foreign investment, up 4.1 percent from the same period last year and 43.3 percent of Shanghai’s total.
