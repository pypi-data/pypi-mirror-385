Chinese TV manufacturers achieved double-digit growth and narrowed the gap with leading South Korean brands in the first quarter, according to industry researcher TrendForce.
In the first quarter, global TV sales reached 49.9 million units, a 0.5 percent growth from a year ago.
Samsung, LG Electronics, TCL, Hisense, Xiaomi, Skyworth and Sony are now the world’s top TV brands, according to the Taiwan-based researcher.
Samsung and LG Electronics posted a drop in sales in the first quarter, compared with Chinese brands’ double-digit growth. TCL, the No. 3 maker, now has 5.69 percent of market share, less than 1 percentage point behind LG Electronics’ 6.50 percent, compared with its previous 3 percentage points gap, TrendForce said.
Hisense and Xiaomi are betting on overseas expansion besides domestic sales, which is fueling their growth, analysts said.
