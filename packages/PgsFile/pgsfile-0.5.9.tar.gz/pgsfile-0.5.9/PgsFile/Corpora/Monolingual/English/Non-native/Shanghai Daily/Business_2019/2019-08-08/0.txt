Alipay launches e-certificate for marriages 
2019-08-08
CHINESE third-party payment platform Alipay has launched a service for acquiring electronic marriage certificates in five provincial-level administrations.
Users in east China’s Fujian, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as southwest China’s Chongqing Municipality, will be able to apply for and receive an e-certificate on mini-programs of local governments on the Alipay application.
A marriage certificate is a valid legal document with numerous functions in China. In addition to proving the legality of a marriage, it is also used for housing purchase loans, birth registrations, property transfers and children's schooling. But couples often forget to carry their certificates with them when the need arises, so the digital version can serve as a convenient alternative.
