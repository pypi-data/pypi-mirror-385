Ad industry takes a hit across board 
2019-08-20
Worries over an unstable economic situation have dampened spending across all categories of advertising in the first half of 2019, with total expenditure down 8.8 percent against 9.3 percent increase a year ago.
In 2018, total advertising spending edged up 2.9 percent.
The performance of digital  and outdoor media shrank as most advertisers seek balanced and integrated campaigns. Digital advertising, once a bright spot, suffered losses of 4.3 percent amid general uncertainty over economic performance.
Food and beverage companies took eight positions in the spending top 20 in terms of total spending through all media channels while transportation services and telecommunication were also strong.
Newspaper and TV advertising at both central and provincial level fell, 12 and 17 percent respectively, and both are the worst in five years.
