SF in new DHL deal on logistics 
2019-03-12
Chinese logistics giant SF Holding and Deutsche Post DHL Group launched a co-branded business — the SF DHL Supply Chain China — in Shanghai yesterday in a bid to reshape the supply chain market in China.
The new company will focus on industries from technology to life science and health care, retail, consumer products, automotive, chemicals to e-commerce.
It will utilize DHL’s global network and SF’s market position in China, according to the new company.
“Leveraging on digitalization and a lean management model, we strive to build a more efficient, transparent and intelligent logistics supply chain,” said Zou Yin, CEO of the new company.
DHL sold its supply chain and logistics business in China to SF Holding in October 2018 as the two companies entered a 10-year strategic partnership.
