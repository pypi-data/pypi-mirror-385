Xi will deliver a keynote speech at the expo’s opening ceremony next Tuesday, address the Hongqiao International Economic Forum, and tour the national pavilions with other country leaders.
During the expo, Xi will meet country leaders and government heads and host a welcoming banquet with his wife Peng Liyuan for guests from more than 170 countries and regions involved in politics, business and academia as well as international organizations.
