2019-09-11
CHINA’S forex regulator yesterday announced it will abolish the investment quota restrictions for the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors and Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors.
The two programs have been important in the opening-up of China’s financial market, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Since the implementation of the QFII system in 2002 and RQFII system in 2011, more than 400 institutional investors from 31 countries and regions have invested in China’s financial market. In the future, qualified foreign institutional investors under the two programs only need to register to remit funds independently to carry out securities investment.
