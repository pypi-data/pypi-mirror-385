HK shares soar 
2019-02-14
The Hong Kong stock market yesterday hit its highest close since August, tracking the rally in mainland shares, after US President Donald Trump suggested a trade truce with China could be extended.
   The Hang Seng index ended 1.2 percent up at 28,497.59 points, its highest close since August 9, 2018, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index closed 1.4 percent higher. Trump said on Tuesday he could let the March 1 deadline for a trade agreement with China “slide for a little while.”
