Horgos Port in northwest Chinaâ€™s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region saw a rise in imports and exports in the first quarter of this year, local authorities said.
From January to March, imports and exports at this land port bordering Kazakhstan reached 8.65 million tons, an increase of 17.1 percent compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by imports, according to the Horgos Customs.
The trade volume hit 26.8 billion yuan (US$4 billion), up 32.24 percent year on year.
Customs said imports were mainly traditional bulk commodities such as natural gas, timber and licorice, with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan as the major importing countries, while exports included mechanical and electrical products, garments, fruits and vegetables.
Ma Lei, a local customs officer, attributes the imports and exports rise to the deepening of the Belt and Road Initiative.
