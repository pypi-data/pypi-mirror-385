Shanghai aims to take the lead in intelligent manufacturing and push the “Made in Shanghai” brand. 
By the end of 2021, the city will turn into a highland for intelligent manufacturing and become the main exporter of intelligent manufacturing solutions, according to a three-year plan on intelligent manufacturing (2019-2021) that was announced yesterday.
The plan was issued by Shanghai Commission of Economy and Informatization at the 2019 Shanghai Intelligent Manufacturing Promotion Conference yesterday.
It spells out the aims and the specific planning required for intelligent manufacturing.
“Intelligent manufacturing is the core driving force for high-quality development. Intelligent manufacturing matters in transformation and in the upgrade of the industry,” Wu Jincheng, secretary of Shanghai Commission of Economy and Informatization, said.
“More resources and more efforts will be put into it,” Wu said.
By the end of 2021, Shanghai is set to achieve 100 critical breakthroughs in intelligent manufacturing equipment, industry software and key components.
The city will create 10-enterprise list on the STAR market, take the lead in formulating 50 criteria on intelligent manufacturing and build two or three national service platforms for intelligent manufacturing.
It will cultivate 10 large suppliers of intelligent manufacturing, 100 intelligent manufacturing factory models and promote 1,000 enterprises to transform by 2021. 
Shanghai will target weak aspects in key areas, promote industries such as automobile, civil aviation, biomedicine, high-end manufacturing and green chemistry to apply intelligent manufacturing.
The city will build “the core and belt” cluster for intelligent manufacturing. 
The core indicates Lingang world-class center for intelligent manufacturing, while the belt consists of industrial areas of Pudong, Minhang, Jiading, Baoshan and Songjiang.
