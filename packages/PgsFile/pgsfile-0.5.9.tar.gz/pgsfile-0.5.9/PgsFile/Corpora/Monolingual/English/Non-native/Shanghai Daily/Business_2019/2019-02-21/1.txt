China remained the single largest market for products of the German electrical industry in 2018, the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers’ Association (ZVEI) announced yesterday.
The value of exports to China increased by 10.3 percent to 21 billion euros (US$23.81 billion). The second-largest market was the United States, which imported goods worth 17.8 billion euros in 2018.
“The already successful cooperation” between Germany and China on many future subjects such as artificial intelligence could be further strengthened, according to chairman of the management board of ZVEI, Klaus Mittelbach. 
European countries such as France, the Netherlands and Britain are also among the most important markets for the German electrical industry.
Overall, exports of electronic goods from Germany grew by 5 percent to 211.9 billion euros in 2018, despite a slight decline towards the end of the year. In December, the value of exports was 15.8 billion euros, a slight fall of 0.3 percent from the same month a year earlier.
