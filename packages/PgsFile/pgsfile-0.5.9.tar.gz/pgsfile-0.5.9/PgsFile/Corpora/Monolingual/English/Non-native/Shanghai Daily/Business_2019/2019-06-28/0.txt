2019-06-28
Johnson & Johnson has unveiled its biggest incubator and the first of its kind in Asia, the JLABS @ Shanghai at the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park.
The park has a capacity for more than 50 startups.
The first batch of 31 startups have joined the facility, covering a wide sector in pharmaceuticals, medical devices and health care. 
The 4,400-square-meter site, a joint venture with Zhangjiang Group’s affiliate Shanghai Pharma Engine Company, is J&J’s 12th such incubator around the world.
It is using the same model as well as the same level of facilities and lab instruments as other sites in the world to help startups join the network of companies and expertise under J&J. 
J&J says it has seen local companies enjoying particular strengths in areas such as artificial intelligence and immuno-oncology. 
Paul Stoffels, vice chairman of the executive committee and chief scientific officer of J&J, noted that by learning from J&J’s know-how about developing pharmaceuticals and medical devices, startups are expected to reduce the time to market their products and improve the probability of their business.
