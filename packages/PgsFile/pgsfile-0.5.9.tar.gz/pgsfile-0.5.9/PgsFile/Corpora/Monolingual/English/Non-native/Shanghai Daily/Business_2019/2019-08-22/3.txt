Couriers for garbage 
2019-08-22
Alibaba’s courier and logistics affiliate, Cainiao Network, has teamed up with five courier companies to install 1,000 recycling boxes in Shanghai to collect reusable material in support of the city’s new garbage-sorting rules.  The number of packages has brought concern about how packaging materials could be collected and recycled. This could also save courier firms’ packaging costs. In the Yangtze River Delta, tens of thousands of boxes have been put up by Cainiao at supermarkets and delivery points at colleges.
