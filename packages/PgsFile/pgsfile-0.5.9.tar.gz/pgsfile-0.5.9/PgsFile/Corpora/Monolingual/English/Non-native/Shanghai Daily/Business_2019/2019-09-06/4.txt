THE second China International Import Expo will be held from November 5 to 10, bigger and better than last year’s successful event. The expo will be spread across 330,000 square meters, 30,000 square meters larger than last year’s event.
In terms of the basic framework, organizers, operators, dates and venues will remain the same as last year. It will continue to include the national comprehensive trade and investment exhibition, the business exhibition, and the Hongqiao International Economic and Trade Forum.
Of the 3,000 companies that have confirmed they will take part in the expo, more than 250 are Global Fortune 500 companies.
There will be seven exhibition sections focusing on five major sectors: equipment, consumption, food, healthcare and services. The seven sections will be: sci-tech life, automobiles, equipment, medical apparatus and healthcare products, food and agricultural products.
The Hongqiao forum will comprise a series of forums, much like the first expo.
The second expo will have an autonomous driving experience area, allowing participants to get close to the latest technologies. Some 20 companies will display their self-driving vehicles.
The first expo last November reported trade volume of US$58 billion, putting the event firmly in the top 10 global business fairs.
