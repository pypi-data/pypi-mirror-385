Jet-leasing firm bets on domestic fleet 
2019-06-14
CDB Aviation, the aircraft-leasing platform of China Development Bank, will put China at the center of its development plans as the nation takes up a rising share of the global fleet.
China remains at the heart of CDB Aviation’s growth strategy and the company is looking to bring its newly established global platform back to China, said Peter Chang, CDB Aviation chief executive officer.
The firm aims to meet the growing demands of Chinese airlines and customers, especially with the rising number of aircraft deliveries directed to the market, he said.
He made the remarks yesterday at Airfinance Journal China 2019 in Shanghai where over 700 senior executives from airlines, leasing firms, financial institutions and investment houses shared knowledge on the most pressing issues and opportunities of the aviation finance landscape.
As air passenger traffic volume continues to grow, China is expected to lead the world’s aviation market by 2022.
According to the latest civil aviation industry development statistical bulletin released by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, China had seen a constant fast growth in the industry with the commercial transport fleet reaching 3,639 by the end of 2018, 343 more than that at the end of 2017.
To support its growth strategy for China, the leasing company has appointed new executive in the Asia-Pacific region, which will account for half of its business in the next two decades, as well as rolled out its world-class platform in China, Chang said.
