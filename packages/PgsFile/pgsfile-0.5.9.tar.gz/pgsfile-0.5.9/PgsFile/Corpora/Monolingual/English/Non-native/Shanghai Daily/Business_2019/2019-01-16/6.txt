Luxury spending defies economic fears 
2019-01-16
Spending on luxury goods on the Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong remains strong against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty, with 94 percent of consumers planning to spend more or maintain current levels, a new survey has found.
Only 6 percent expect to trim their luxury spending over the next 12 months, the online survey by public relations firm Ruder Finn and Hong Kong-headquartered research consultancy Consumer Search Group says.
And shopping is the most important factor in choosing where to travel overseas.
The survey of 1,385 consumers with a household income of 841,489 yuan (US$144,455) on the mainland and 1.4 million yuan in Hong Kong found more than half of mainland consumers are likely to spend more on luxury electronics, beauty and cosmetic products, and clothing.
But mainland shoppers are also now buying luxury items largely for taste and lifestyle, a shift from the “show-off-to-the-outsider” attitude seen in previous studies.
“Against the backdrop of this market volatility, companies must fully tap the wide variety of consumer market opportunities in order to successfully engage with the changing face of the Chinese luxury consumer,” said Gao Ming, Ruder Finn Asia senior vice president and general manager for luxury practice in China.
Total spending on luxury goods in the past year was higher among millennials aged between 26 and 35 in both Hong Kong and the mainland.
And China’s Generation Z luxury consumers are much younger compared to their international counterparts, the survey says.
