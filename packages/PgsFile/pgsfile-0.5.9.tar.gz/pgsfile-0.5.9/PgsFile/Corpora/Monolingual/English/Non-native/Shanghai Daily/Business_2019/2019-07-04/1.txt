2019-07-04
CHINA will step up efforts to support pilot free trade zones to deepen the reform and opening-up and facilitate cross-border e-commerce.
The decision was made at a State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang yesterday.
To advance the reform and opening-up and the economic transformation and upgrading, the country will encourage pilot FTZs to be pioneers in alleviating administrative burdens, improving services and promoting innovation, according to a statement released after the meeting.
Meanwhile, various measures will be unveiled to accelerate the development of cross-border e-commerce, which propels Chinaâ€™s industrial upgrading, unleashes market potential, boosts the logistics sector and creates jobs, the statement said.
With more comprehensive cross-border e-commerce pilot zones to be added, the country will streamline the administrative procedures for taxing related businesses and enhance services.
In addition, the meeting decided to strengthen the protection of intellectual property in the cross-border e-commerce industry and the crackdown on counterfeiting and infringement.
