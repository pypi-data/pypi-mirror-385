CHINA must balance the relationship between stabilizing growth and financial risk prevention, the state council’s financial stability committee concluded in a meeting chaired by Vice Premier Liu He.
China will strengthen capital capabilities for commercial banks, especially small to medium-sized lenders, according to a statement released after the meeting. “(We must) maintain the stable operation of the financial system, and maintain the stability of the overall economic and social environment,” it said.
