Portugal defiant 
2019-12-06
PORTUGUESE officials have told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo they won’t exclude Chinese companies from competing in a tender for the next-generation 5G wireless network.
It is the latest move by a European Union country resisting US efforts to persuade allies they should shun Huawei’s bids for 5G contracts.
Pompeo warned yesterday that the Chinese government “won’t hesitate” to use Huawei as a back door to confidential data. But Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said 5G operators will have to abide by strict regulations and that all foreign investment is welcome.
