Bank issues 1-year NCD 
2019-05-22
Hang Seng China has just issued negotiable certificates of deposit (NCD) with a total value of 1.83 billion yuan (US$265 million), allowing foreign institutional investors to invest directly in the primary NCD market through Bond Connect.
The bank is the first overseas bank in China to issue such an instrument and it offered the one-year NCD at interest rate of 3.37 percent to both domestic and overseas institutional investors.
Negotiable certificates of deposit are fixed deposit receipts that can be sold in a secondary market and large institutions are the most common buyers.
To date, eight institutions have made the subscription, including commercial banks, overseas branches of domestic commercial lenders, major state-owned banks and domestic commercial banks, as well as foreign banks and securities companies in China.
Ryan Song, vice chairman and chief executive of Hang Sengâ€™s China business, said that direct NCD issuance to foreign institutional investors through Bond Connect reflects further opening up the financial sector.
