China’s central bank injected liquidity into the money market through reverse repos yesterday.
   The People’s Bank of China conducted 60 billion yuan (US$9 billion) of seven-day reverse repos at an interest rate of 2.55 percent.
   As 20 billion yuan of reverse repos were due yesterday, the central bank effectively pumped 40 billion yuan into the market.
   Yesterday’s interbank market showed the overnight Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, which measures the borrowing cost in China’s interbank market, dropped 5.1 basis points to 2.65 percent.
   The seven-day Shibor increased 0.5 basis points to 2.75 percent, while the two-week rate was up 2.5 basis points to nearly 2.89 percent.
