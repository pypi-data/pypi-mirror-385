Banks lead market slide 
2019-03-01
Shanghai stocks fell again yesterday, dragged down by the non-bank financial sector. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.44 percent to close at 2,940.95 points. The smaller Shenzhen Component Index edged up 0.29 percent to 9,031.93 points, while the blue chip CSI300 index shed 0.25 percent to 3,669.37 points.
Total turnover in the two bourses further shrank, down sharply from Wednesday’s 891.24 billion yuan (US$133.26) to 662.29 billion yuan, after hitting almost 1.1 trillion yuan earlier in the week. But overall, Shanghai’s Composite Index soared 13.79 percent in February — the highest monthly rise since April 2015. 
The total turnover in the Shanghai bourse in February also swelled to 3.81 trillion yuan, compared with 2.8 trillion yuan in January.
Venture capital-related shares led yesterday’s losses — seven companies nosedived the daily limit of 10 percent.
These included Shanghai Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park Development Co and Kunwu Jiuding Investment Holdings Co.
Brokerages were also among the biggest losers.
