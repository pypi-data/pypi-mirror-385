Efforts to boost infrastructure, environmental protection and resource sharing among cities in the Yangtze River Delta region were discussed at a conference yesterday intended to spur integrated and high-quality growth in the region.
“The region will collaborate closely to develop city clusters and infrastructure for transport and digital facilities; come up with single standard for waste disposal and integrate public services including health care and senior care,” a declaration showed. It also states cities will gear up in collaboration to better host the China International Import Expo and encourage resource sharing among pilot free trade zones in the region.
