2019-04-11
French retailer Carrefour is teaming up with Gome Retail Holdings in a deal that will see the latter open “shops-within-shops” in more than 200 Carrefour hypermarkets in China by the end of July, according to a joint statement.
Gome’s offerings in Carrefour stores will include bestselling home appliances, smart devices and other consumer electronics.
Thierry Garnier, president of Carrefour Asia, told reporters yesterday that the partnership is expected to enhance its new business and the company will continue to experiment with innovations for the local market.
“We will keep an open mindset and will be seeking more collaborators in areas where other players have more capability and expertise while we stay focused on the food and fresh goods categories,” he said. 
Gome will specialize in big-ticket appliance and consumer electronics, logistics and customer services while Carrefour will add in product promotion and marketing.
