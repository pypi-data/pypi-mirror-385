Slow rise in home prices 
2019-03-05
HOME prices in Chinese cities grew at a slower pace in February and are expected to remain stable, according to the China Index Academy, a property research institution.
The average price of new homes in 100 cities increased 0.1 percent month on month in February, down 0.12 percentage points from January, according to a statement from the institution.
With continued pullback of the monthly growth rate, the change in average house prices of most Chinese cities was less than 1 percent last month, the statement added.
Due to the Spring Festival, February is usually the off-season for China’s real estate market. Many Chinese cities rolled out this year’s real estate market policies in a bid to maintain market stability last month.
Fang Hang, the institution’s analyst, estimated that the future real estate market is moving toward a more reasonable direction and investment is growing at a slower pace.
