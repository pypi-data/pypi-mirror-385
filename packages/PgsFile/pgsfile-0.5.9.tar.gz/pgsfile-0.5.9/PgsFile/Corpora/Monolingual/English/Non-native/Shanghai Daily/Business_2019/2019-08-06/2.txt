Car recalls halve 
2019-08-06
China recalled more than 3.08 million defective cars in the first seven months of this year — half that of the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. 
Recalls in July were mainly due to car body assembly faults, airbag and safety belt issues and minor problems with batteries and electrical equipment. In last year’s first half, the main problems were engine and brake system problems. Last month, about 420,000 vehicles were recalled due to electrical equipment problems and 4,800 due to battery problems.
