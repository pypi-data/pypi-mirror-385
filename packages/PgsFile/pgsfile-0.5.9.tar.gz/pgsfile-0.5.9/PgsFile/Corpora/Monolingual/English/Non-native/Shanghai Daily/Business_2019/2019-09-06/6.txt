2019-09-06
CHINA is not considering withdrawing its complaint at the World Trade Organization against the United States over tariffs that Washington had imposed on US$300 billion worth of Chinese goods, China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng said yesterday.
The US imposition seriously violates the rules of free trade and the multilateral trading system, according to Gao.
China’s complaint with WTO is a totally justified action by China to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and to protect the multilateral trade system, he added.
China, on Monday, lodged a complaint with the WTO, a day after the US imposed tariffs on US$300 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to the ministry.
China will firmly safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests and resolutely uphold the multilateral trading system as well as the international trade order in line with WTO rules, the ministry said.
