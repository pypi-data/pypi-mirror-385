Azerbaijan airline AZAL has cancelled a US$1 billion contract with Boeing to purchase 10 737 MAX jets, a spokesman said yesterday, following the fatal crashes involving the aircraft in Ethiopia and Indonesia.
   “AZAL refused to buy 10 aircraft from Boeing due to safety reasons,” Pasha Kesaminsy said.
