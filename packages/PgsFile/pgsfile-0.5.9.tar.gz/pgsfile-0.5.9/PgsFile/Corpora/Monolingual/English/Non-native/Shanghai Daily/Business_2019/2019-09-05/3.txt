China had signed third-party market cooperation documents with 14 countries by the end of June to jointly build cooperation platforms for enterprises, China’s economic planner said.
To jointly push forward the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, China has deepened international cooperation in production capacity and carried out third-party market cooperation with other countries, including France, Japan, Italy and the United Kingdom, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.
Third-party market cooperation refers to the economic cooperation between Chinese enterprises and enterprises of other countries in the third-party market.
As an open and inclusive international cooperation model, third-party market cooperation can help both Chinese enterprises and enterprises of various countries complement each other, promote the growth of the third country’s industries, infrastructure and people’s livelihood to achieve the effect of “one plus one plus one is greater than three,” according to the NDRC.
Third-party market cooperation conforms to the historical trend of economic globalization, meets the realistic needs of open cooperation and interactive development of various countries. The NDRC has issued a bilingual edition of Guidelines and Cases for Third-Party Market Cooperation in Chinese and English.
