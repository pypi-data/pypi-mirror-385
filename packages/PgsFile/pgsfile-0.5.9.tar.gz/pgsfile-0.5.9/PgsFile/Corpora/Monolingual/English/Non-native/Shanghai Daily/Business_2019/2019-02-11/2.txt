Pilot strike grounding CAL flights 
2019-02-11
A STRIKE by pilots at Taiwan’s China Airlines dragged into a third day yesterday, resulting in further flight cancellations.
There was no immediate word of a settlement as the pilots’ union remained firm in its demands for an additional backup pilot on flights lasting eight hours or more, a more transparent system of promotion, a year-end bonus and other concessions.
The Central News Agency said a total of 47 flights were canceled.
The strike came in the middle of the Lunar New Year travel rush. About 70 percent of the carrier’s 1,300 pilots belong to the union, which has accused management of insincerity and mistreating its workforce to keep costs down. CAL crews went on strike for 24 hours in 2016 for better conditions.
The airline has said it is willing to talk but that the union’s demands in talks are different from those it makes in public.
