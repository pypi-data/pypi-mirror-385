‘Side hustle’ slowly gaining in popularity 
2019-05-08
More professionals are taking up side jobs besides their regular day work as they seek creative freedom, recruitment firm Hays said.
Known as a “side hustle,” the work is generally a freelance project which the person is passionate about — and is different to a part-time job.
“Side hustles are about creating assets in a way that you own and control — they’re not about working for another employer in your spare time,” said Hays CEO Alistair Cox.
“As such, when you set up a side hustle, you are the master of its destiny, nobody else. It’s yours and yours alone.” 
Side hustles are becoming increasingly popular among professionals, as they can generate extra income and gives professionals an opportunity to pursue something that they are passionate about outside of work, the recruitment company explained.
Besides, people are going after side hustles out of their cravings for variety and creativity, Hays said. As people are increasingly living longer, they will have to work longer. 
As a result, professionals will look for more variety in their career and a side hustle can provide that.
Rather than employers being concerned about side hustles, they should embrace the many benefits an employee’s side hustle can bring to their business, Hays said.
