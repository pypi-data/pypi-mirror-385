New Twitter feature 
2019-08-15
Twitter users will be able to follow a small number of interests by the end of the year in the same way they follow people, the company said on Tuesday.
   The feature will be rolled out internationally as the one-to-many messaging platform prioritizes being an online venue for conversations rather than a pulpit for one-way broadcasting to the masses. “We are basically rewriting the entire conversation service,” Twitter product team leader Kayvon Beykpour said.
