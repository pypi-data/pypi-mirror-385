VOLKSWAGEN Group China will attend the 2019 China International Import Expo to showcase its portfolio of Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche new-energy vehicles.
The German automaker said this year’s CIIE will be an opportunity to explore ways to transition to electrification with its Chinese partners.
The Volkswagen exhibition zone will display the ID.3, the first mass-produced vehicle based on Volkswagen’s MEB platform — its modular car platform for electric cars. Audi’s zone will showcase its mass-produced electric cars. Porsche is bringing three models — the Cayenne E-Hybrid, the 919 Hybrid and the Taycan, its first fully electric sports car. Volkswagen will display its latest car models and technologies in Hall 2.1 at the National Exhibition and Convention Center, with the theme “Shape the New Era of Sustainable Mobility in China.”
