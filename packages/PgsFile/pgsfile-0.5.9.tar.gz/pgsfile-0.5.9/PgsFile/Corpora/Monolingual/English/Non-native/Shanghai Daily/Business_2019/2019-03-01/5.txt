Moving to lure more funds from overseas 
2019-03-01
China will keep improving the legal and market environments for foreign investors to attract more overseas capital inflow, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
The country faces a complex situation in utilizing foreign investment as the global economy slows down, cross-border direct investment remains sluggish and competition for foreign capital intensifies, Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen told a meeting that ended Wednesday.
Wang said the government will legalize its foreign investment policy system, build high-quality national economic development zones, enhance regional coordination and improve services for foreign investors.
The MOC launched a campaign to facilitate overseas investment inflow last year. Foreign direct investment totalled US$135 billion in 2018, up 3 percent year on year.
A draft of China’s foreign investment law will be submitted to the upcoming annual session of the top legislature, the National People’s Congress. Once adopted, it will help China attract more foreign investment and better protect foreign investors’ legitimate rights and interests.
