Pre-used home sales fall again 
2019-06-13
Sales of pre-occupied homes fell for the second month in Shanghai with prices remaining quite stable, according to the latest data.
Citywide, around 23,000 units of existing homes changed hands last month, a decrease of 8 percent from April, Shanghai Homelink Real Estate Agency Co said in a regular report. On a year-over-year basis, the figure rose 45 percent.
These pre-used homes were sold for an average of 38,701 yuan (US$5,587) per square meter, or 3.06 million yuan per unit, both 1 percent down from a month ago.
“Shanghai’s existing housing market continued to lose momentum in May, showing similar weakness plaguing the new-home market during the same period,” said Yang Yulei, a Shanghai Homelink senior analyst. “However, it is unclear whether it heralds a downward trend or just an insignificant retreat before the market picks up strength again.”
By area, Pujiang in Minhang District, Sanlin in the Pudong New Area and Nanqiao New City in Fengxian District were the three most sought-after communities in May, selling 617, 567 and 499 homes at an average cost of 29,227 yuan per square meter, 42,653 yuan per square meter and 20,555 yuan per square meter, respectively.
Between January and May, a total of 101,000 units of existing homes were sold around the city, an increase of 53 percent from the same period a year ago, Homelink data showed.
