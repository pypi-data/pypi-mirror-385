Record debut on STAR 
2019-08-09
Two more firms started trading on the Shanghai STAR Market yesterday, setting a record high on the newly opened index.
Shanghai Friendess Electronic Technology, a laser-cutting firm, surged 255.6 percent to hit 243.9 (US$34.8), creating a record-high price among all existing 27 STAR firms.
And Chip designer Amlogic (Shanghai) Co surged 272.4 percent to close at 143.4 yuan.
The shares had been temporally halted for trading for 10 minutes to “cool down” after surging 30 percent.
That was in contrast to the mainstream Shanghai trading board, where price gains are capped at 44 percent on debut days and trading swings are limited to 10 percent a day for the duration of trading.
