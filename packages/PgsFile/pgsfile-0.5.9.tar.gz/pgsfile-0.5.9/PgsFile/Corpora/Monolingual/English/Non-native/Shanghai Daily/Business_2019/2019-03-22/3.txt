City axes red tape to boost trade 
2019-03-22
Shanghai yesterday announced 22 measures to cut red tape and costs at its ports to improve trade.
Announcing the reforms, Wu Wei, deputy director of the Shanghai Commission of Commerce, also serving the function of the Shanghai Office for Port Services, said the city would push forward in-advance declarations for imports and exports. This would allow faster customs clearance.
And companies will be allowed to correct unintentional errors in their paperwork with a lighter or no penalty if they promptly report them to customs authorities.
Documentation is being simplified, reducing paperwork and increasing paperless processing.
With the changes, the process for the declaration and payment of customs duties and the exchange of bills of landing and delivery orders will be cut to less than four hours from days. 
Port fees are also being cut, agents will be encouraged to reduce their rates and price supervision will be boosted.
