Chinese team makes power storage breakthrough 
2019-03-11
A CHINESE research team has developed a new calcium-ion-based energy storage device, which has proved to have high capacity and a long cycling life at room temperature.
Calcium-ion batteries have long attracted attention as a replacement for lithium-ion batteries.
They have a larger capacity than LIBs, as a calcium-ion can provide twice the number of electrons than lithium-ion.
In addition, calcium is about 2,500 times as common than lithium, making calcium-ion energy storage technology a promising candidate for next-generation batteries due to its high performance and low cost.
But calcium-ion batteries have generally underperformed in previous studies due to the lack of an appropriate combination of electrode materials and electrolytes. The new device, developed by a research team led by Tang Yongbing from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has overcome this major obstacle.
The new hybrid device uses activated carbon as a positive electrode and tin as a negative electrode, according to a paper recently published on the website of the scientific journal Advanced Energy Materials.
“It has a good rate and cycling performance as well as high capacity and working voltage,” Tang said, adding it successfully retained 84 percent of its capacity after 1,000 cycles at room temperature.
“This is the best electrochemical performance ever achieved by calcium-ion-based energy storage devices. Considering the low cost and simple manufacturing technique, we are one step closer to next-generation energy storage.”
