Shanghai licenses for ICV testing 
2019-09-17
Shanghai issued its first batch of intelligent and connected vehicle testing license plates for the Yangtze River Delta region yesterday.
During the 2019 World Autonomous Vehicle Ecosystem Conference held in Shanghai, Jiangsu autonomous driving company AllRide.ai and Zhejiang-based automaker Geely received the licenses that will allow them to conduct testing on open roads in Jiading District.
The Shanghai Commission of Economy and Informatization said the testing licenses will bolster interconnectivity, intercommunication and mutual recognition of ICVs in Shanghai, as well as nearby Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. They will also reduce unnecessary repeated testing, save costs for auto companies and promote industry development in the region.
The city also issued Chinaâ€™s first batch of ICV demonstration licenses to three companies: SAIC Motor Co, BMW and Didi. 
The licenses will allow these companies to conduct demonstration applications on urban roads, including carrying people and goods. 
It is an important step for the commercial use of ICV in the future.
Besides, Shanghai has extended the length of roads for autonomous vehicle testing from 11.1 kilometers to 53.6 kilometers, the city government said yesterday. The testing area consists of various environments including industrial, commercial, residential areas as well as transportation hubs.
Wu Qing, vice mayor of Shanghai, said the city is a national leader in the ICV field. 
Wu said Shanghai has allocated related professionals to focus on key areas including research and development, design, telecommunication and electronics, voice recognition and smart manufacturing.
