Sportswear firm beats projections 
2019-02-13
Under Armour Inc, exceeded Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit yesterday as the sportswear maker cut product sourcing costs and sold fewer discounted sneakers during the holiday shopping season.
Inventory levels, which fell 12 percent during the quarter, and rising demand for the company’s popular Project Rock, Curry 6 and HOVR sneakers allowed Under Armour to cut back on discounts.
During the peak holiday period, the Baltimore-based company’s online markdowns were about 10 to 20 percent lower compared with a year earlier, William Blair analysts said before the results were announced.
Under Armour’s Class A common shares rose 2.7 percent in early trading following the results.
The company reported a net income of US$4.2 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, compared with a loss of US$87.9 million a year earlier, when it took a one-time charge related to changes in the US tax law.
