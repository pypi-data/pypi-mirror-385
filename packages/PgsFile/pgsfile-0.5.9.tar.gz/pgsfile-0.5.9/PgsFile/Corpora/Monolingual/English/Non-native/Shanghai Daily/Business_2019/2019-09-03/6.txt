Manufacturing grows fastest in 5 months 
2019-09-03
CHINESE manufacturing activity accelerated in August from a month earlier, with firms registering the fastest increase in production in five months, according to Caixin figures released yesterday.
The Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, which is weighted toward private companies, edged up to 50.4 last month from 49.9 in July, Caixin magazine and research firm Markit said.
A reading above 50 signals growth, while below 50 points to contraction.
China’s official manufacturing PMI, released on Saturday, edged down slightly to 49.5 in August from 49.7 in the previous month.
The rebound in Caixin’s headline PMI figure signals improvement in the overall health of the manufacturing sector, according to the report.
Supporting the higher headline reading was the quickest increase in production in five months. Though only slight overall, the expansion contrasted with broadly unchanged output in July and a reduction in June, contributing to the first rise in stocks of finished goods to-date in 2019.
The gauge for new export orders, however, remained in contractionary territory and fell to the lowest level this year in August, reflecting declining foreign demand amid an intensifying trade dispute between China and the US, according to Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group. But data indicated that improved domestic demand helped offset a further reduction in export sales. The subindex for new orders stayed in expansionary territory but inched down, “suggesting flat demand for manufactured products,” Zhong said.
Capacity pressures meanwhile persisted in August, as highlighted by a further increase in work backlogs.
