Disgraced Korean Air chairman dead at 70 
2019-04-09
Korean Air’s chairman, whose leadership included scandals such as his daughter’s infamous incident of “nut rage,” has died due to illness, the company said yesterday.
Cho Yang-ho had been indicted on multiple charges, including embezzlement and tax evasion, and his death came two weeks after shareholders voted to remove the 70-year-old from the company’s board over a series of scandals surrounding his family. Cho’s death will likely force a court to dismiss his criminal case.
The company said in a statement that Cho died at a hospital in Los Angeles but did not specify his illness or provide other details. Cho had remained chairman, which is a non-board role, even after shareholders ousted him from the board. He had expressed his intent to continue participating in management.
A senior Korean Air executive said Cho had been receiving treatment for an unspecified lung illness since late last year and that his condition “worsened rapidly” following the shareholder vote, apparently because of shock and stress. The executive didn’t want to be named, citing office rules.
Korean Air’s corporate flag and the South Korean flag were flown half-staff at the company’s headquarters in downtown Seoul.
Cho’s eldest daughter, Cho Hyun-ah, formerly the head of the airline’s cabin service, received worldwide notoriety in 2014 after she ordered a Korean Air flight to return to New York because she was angry that the crew served her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a plate.
