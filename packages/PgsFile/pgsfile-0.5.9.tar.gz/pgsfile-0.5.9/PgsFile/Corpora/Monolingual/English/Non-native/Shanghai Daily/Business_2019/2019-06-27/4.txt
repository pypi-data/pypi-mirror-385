AI art interactive raises the temperature 
2019-06-27
A spectacular “Art*AI” show has been pencilled for the next month at the MoCA Shanghai within the People’s Park.
Four artists Li Yuansu, Zhang Ying, Liu Jiayu and Zhou Hoho plan to showcase the very best of their innovative works and highlight the future of science in art. Some express how artificial intelligence works from an artist’s perspective while the others use AI technology to create art from facial recognition, motion captures, 3D image building and data visualization.
In the AI Championship, created by artist Li, various materials and technology is used to express how AI works. Images of Neuron Network, Mobile Computing Platform and Car Recognition System are shown.
In another of Li’s work, “Change of Nanjing Road West,” audiences are invited to interact with smart devices, which create customized images by AI. The integration between art and AI brings a “unique beauty and interactive experience,” said Miriam Sun, executive director of MoCA Shanghai.
The combination between art and tech makes AI “accessible and close” to ordinary people, said SenseTime, an AI startup offering tech support of the show.
“AI should not only be a word of industry jargons, but also carry the temperature (to bring warmth to the people),” said SenseTime.
Previously, SenseTime has drafted AI textbooks for students in Shanghai.
 
Date: Through July 14, 10am-9pm
Address: Gate 7, 231 Nanjing Rd W.
