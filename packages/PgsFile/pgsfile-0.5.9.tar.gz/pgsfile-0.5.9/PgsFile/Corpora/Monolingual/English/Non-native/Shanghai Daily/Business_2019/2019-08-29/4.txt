2019-08-29
A TRANSIT line similar to one in Hong Kong will help bring Lingang area closer to Shanghai downtown, according to an adviser from Hong Kong who plans to raise the subject at a meeting next Wednesday.
Jacky Chung, a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference Shanghai Committee, will suggest building a rapid transit system “like Hong Kong Airport Express service” at the 12th standing committee meeting of the 13th Shanghai Committee of the CPPCC.
As regional director, Eastern & Central China of Hong Kong Trade Development Council, he will deliver a keynote speech along with two other advisers from Hong Kong and Macau.
“A parallel Metro line, as well as an expressway, could be built at the same time,” said Chung.
Chen Yin, vice mayor of Shanghai and director of the Lingang Special Area Administrative Committee, will be briefed on the progress made on the construction of the new area at the meeting next week.
Thirteen political advisers will offer suggestions on the establishment of a tax system with international competitiveness, among others.
