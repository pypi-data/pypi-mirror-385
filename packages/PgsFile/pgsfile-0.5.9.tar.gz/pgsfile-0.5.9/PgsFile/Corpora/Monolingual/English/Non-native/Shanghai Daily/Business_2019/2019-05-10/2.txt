Indigenous brands go online for new buyers 
2019-05-10
They are laozihao, or time-honored brands, some of which are centuries old and are now riding the Internet wave.
They will have their presence at the second Exposition on China Indigenous Brands to be held from today until Sunday at the Shanghai Exhibition Center. One of the products is zongzi, with some laozihao teaming up with new platforms to find new selling points as China heads into the Dragon Boat Festival on June 7.
Alibabaâ€™s fresh food and grocery market Freshippo is exploring the changing tastes of consumers, working with three local manufacturers of zongzi, the traditional sticky rice dumpling, to sell nationwide. 
Shanghai Old-Town Temple Restaurant, a time-honored brand, has launched an innovative pear syrup herbal drink which is also available on its Tmall flagship store. 
The herbal medicine Li Gao Lu, which can treat cough effectively, is now available as a canned ready-to-drink beverage, so people can conveniently take it on the go. 
Previously, it was only available in thick syrup form so hot water had to be added before drinking.  
It was released in its original flavor in April and a new flavor will be released this month.
Alibaba is also banking on its digital power to help more than 200 local indigenous brands achieve more than 1 billion yuan (US$150 million) in sales, as well as helping smaller firms. And the e-commerce giant is helping them go global.
