Lagarde yesterday met Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and assured him that the IMF stands ready to support his country.
   The meeting took place on the sidelines of the World Government Summit in Dubai.
   “I reiterated that the IMF stands ready to support Pakistan,” Lagarde said in a statement following meeting Khan.
   An IMF team visited Pakistan in November to discuss a possible bailout with officials, though the talks ended without agreement.
