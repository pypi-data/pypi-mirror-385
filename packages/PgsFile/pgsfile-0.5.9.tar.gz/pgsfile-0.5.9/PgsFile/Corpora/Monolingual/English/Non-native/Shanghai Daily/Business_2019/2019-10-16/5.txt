Yuan to be big source of foreign investment 
2019-10-16
China would continue to see an increase in outbound direct investment in the mid to long term, bringing new impetus to China’s economy, EY said in its latest “China Go Abroad” report.
“In the short term, as the US withdraws its capital and focuses on the domestic market, Chinese capital will become the major source of foreign investment in many overseas countries,” said Loletta Chow, global leader of EY China Overseas Investment Network.
“Trade frictions put higher requirements on Chinese enterprises’ development, which will accelerate the integration of related industries and push companies to transform and upgrade,” commented Jesse Lu, global tax leader of EY China Overseas Investment Network.
It also expects high-tech and high value-added sectors, high-end service industries and consumer products to be the focus of overseas M&A activity.
Chinese enterprises should, on the one hand, actively seek overseas investment in high-quality mineral products, crude oil and integrated circuits to secure strategic resources and key technology products from a supply chain perspective, the report suggests.
On the other hand, Chinese enterprises should also increase their research and development investment in fields such as integrated circuits, instruments and equipment to improve self-sufficiency and production capacity, while actively developing renewable energy and new-energy-related industries, thereby reducing dependence on related imports, it added.
At the same time, regulations are also becoming increasingly stringent as many developed countries have strengthened foreign direct investment screening, citing national security concerns.
The total value of Chinese outbound direct investment in the first half of 2019 totaled 346.8 billion yuan (US$48.8 billion), a dip of 0.1 percent in yuan-denominated measures, amid heightened geopolitical tensions and regulatory updates, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
The total number of merger and acquisition deals dropped nearly 40 percent in the first half of this year.
