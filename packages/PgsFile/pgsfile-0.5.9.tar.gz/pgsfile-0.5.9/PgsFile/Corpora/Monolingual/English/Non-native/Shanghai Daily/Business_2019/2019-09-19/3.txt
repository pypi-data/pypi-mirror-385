Huawei to upgrade computing ecosystem 
2019-09-19
Huawei Technologies revealed several ways it is to upgrade its computing ecosystem at an event in Shanghai yesterday. They cover one of the world’s fastest artificial intelligence training platforms, US$1.5 billion in investment in the developer community, and cloud used in various industries and non-profit projects to bring digital benefits to 500 million people globally. 
It released the world’s fastest AI training cluster, known as Atlas 900, yesterday. 
The new AI cluster combines the power of thousands of Huawei’s Ascend processors and will make AI technology more readily available in fields such as scientific research and business innovation. 
Currently, the world’s leading AI training clusters are offered by Google and Nvidia. 
The company was forced to develop its own operating system and related ecosystem after it was added to the US “Entity List” of banned foreign companies last year. The ban forbids US tech firms such as Google and Intel offering chips and systems to Huawei, without special permission.
The computing market offers huge potential for firms like Huawei, Ken Hu, its deputy chairman, told the Huawei Connect 2019 event.
“We’ll keep investing with a strategy that focuses on key areas. We will push the boundaries of architecture, invest in processors for all scenarios, keep clear business boundaries and build an open ecosystem.”
Releases during the three-day event will help Huawei enhance and consolidate its own ecosystem based on a self-developed operating system called Harmony or Hong Meng in Chinese, industry insiders said.
