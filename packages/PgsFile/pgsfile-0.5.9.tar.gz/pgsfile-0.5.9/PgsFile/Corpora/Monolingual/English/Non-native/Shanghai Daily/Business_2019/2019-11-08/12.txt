Exhibits to be put up at CBD center 
2019-11-08
A batch of exhibits at the China International Import Expo will be brought into the Hongqiao Import Commodity Exhibition and Trading Center.
Among them are vintage cars from United States car dealer Bund on the Boulevard LLC which have become star exhibits at the event. After the expo, Hall 1 of the center will become an exhibition area, especially for the imported autos.
To date, the center, a major platform offering exhibition and trading services to support the CIIE, has drawn nearly 80 exhibitors, of which nearly 30 are taking an active part in the import expo.
Fu Naixun, deputy director of the Hongqiao Central Business District’s administrative committee, said the center will serve as an important platform supporting the Hongqiao CBD’s development of an international trading center.
Many CIIE exhibits will be taken there, allowing the public to get a close look or experience and buy the products, Fu said.
Zhao Jun, director of the committee’s commerce office, said a series of support policies and measures have been issued.
For instance, public transport will be adjusted, making it more convenient for visitors to reach the center. Zhao hopes the Hongqiao CBD will be the first stop for people to visit in China and the center will be a foothold for foreign firms to expand their business in China.
