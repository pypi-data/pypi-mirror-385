Improved macro-control the key to growth 
2019-01-18
CHINA will be able to keep economic growth within a reasonable range this year, despite greater difficulties, by innovating and improving macro-control, Premier Li Keqiang said yesterday
Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks when presiding over a symposium for soliciting views and suggestions on a draft version of the government work report.
The symposium was attended by leaders of non-communist parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and representatives of personages without party affiliation.
China has already learnt how to keep economic growth within a reasonable range without adopting strong stimulus policies that would have an economy-wide impact, Li said.
With innovations and improvement in macro-control, the country will be able to attain a relatively high level of employment, sustained growth in income and improvement in the natural environment, he said.
China will focus more on stimulating the vitality of market entities by deepening reform and opening-up, improving the business environment and helping enterprises, especially small ones, reduce their burdens substantially, Li said.
The country will also encourage new drivers of growth by offering greater support for business startups and innovation.
