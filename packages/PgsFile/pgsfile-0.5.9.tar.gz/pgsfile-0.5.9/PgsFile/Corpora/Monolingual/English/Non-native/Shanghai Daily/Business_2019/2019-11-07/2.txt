2019-11-07
SHANGHAI held a city promotion convention on the second day of the China International Import Expo in its latest bid to attract more foreign capital and enterprises to the city.
The city’s urban functions, its business environment and overall competitiveness were highlighted at the conference, held under the theme of “Embracing the CIIE, Sharing a Future.”
“As China’s largest economic hub, Shanghai will keep striving for a more open market, more vibrant spirit of innovation as well as a more inclusive business environment,” Shanghai Party Secretary Li Qiang told the convention, which attracted nearly 1,000 participants, including key exhibitors from the CIIE, and representatives from multinational corporations, state-owned-enterprises and private companies.
“We look forward to forging deep cooperation with more enterprises and talent from all around the world,” he added.
Special promotions for the Pudong New Area, the Linggang Special Area of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, the Zhangjiang National Innovation Demonstration Zone and the Hongqiao Central Business District were made at the convention, offering participants in-depth information about the development prospects and vast opportunities in the four key areas of the city.
“Standing at the forefront of China’s reform and opening-up policy, Shanghai is the best choice for foreign enterprises to enter the China market, while at the same time, the best springboard for domestic companies to extend their footprint outside the country,” Li said.
“Choosing Shanghai means access to a large talent pool, abundant data and scenarios as well as vigorous innovation synergy.”
Meanwhile, in a major move to implement China’s newly drafted Foreign Investment Law, which will come into effect next year, and to better serve foreign investors and foreign-invested enterprises, the Shanghai government also launched a foreign investment promotion service platform and released an industrial map (Investment Promotion Guidance) with comprehensive information on the city’s investment environment, investment policies and industrial distribution so as to precisely connect and match investment projects with the host area.
