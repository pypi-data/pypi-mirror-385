Of this total, 2.76 trillion yuan was exported, down 0.8 percent, while imports fell 4.7 percent to 1.58 trillion yuan.
The European Union was the largest trading partner at 2.72 trillion yuan between January-July, up 10.8 percent to account for 15.6 percent of all foreign trade. Exports rose 12.6 percent to 1.64 trillion yuan, while 1.08 trillion yuan was imported from the EU, up 8.2 percent, putting the trade surplus with the EU up 22.2 percent to 559.65 billion yuan.

“Although the additional US tariffs on Chinese goods are perceived to be negative to China’s export outlook for the rest of 2019, the rising trend in China’s exports to non-US markets may act as a cushion,” said Betty Wang, senior China economist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.
“In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that hitherto there has been no huge impact on electronic manufacturers’ orders and the additional cost incurred by the tariffs could be absorbed by large downstream companies which have relatively high profit margins,” Wang added.
Also of note, private enterprises posted rapid growth in imports and exports. In the first seven months, they contributed a total of 7.31 trillion yuan to China’s exports and imports, up 11.8 percent, accounting for 42 percent of the total foreign trade value which is 2.9 percent higher than the same period last year.
