2019-11-25
Japanese automaker Toyota and Subaru will recall a total of 12,637 Alphard cars and 17,479 vehicles sold in the Chinese market over safety hazards, respectively, according to China’s market regulator.
Filed by Toyota Motor (China) Investment Co, the recall from December 29 will involve imported Alphard models manufactured between December 11, 2017 and March 29, 2019, according to the State Administration of Market Regulation in a statement.
Due to defective charging control programs in the engine control computer, the battery might suffer abnormal deterioration and the engine may not be re-started after shutdown in some circumstances, which will pose safety risks, said the administration.
The company said it will rectify the programs, check batteries on the affected vehicles and replace the defective parts free of charge.
Meanwhile, Subaru’s recall, set to begin on December 2, affects 10,487 Foresters manufactured between September 3, 2018 and June 19, 2019, according to a statement posted on the website of the State Administration for Market Regulation.
Furthermore, 6,992 XV models produced between August 9, 2017 and August 1, 2019, would be recalled as well.
A defective program in these cars’ engine control unit might cause a short circuit and lead to unintended engine stop, posing safety risks, said the statement.
Subaru will check and fix the defective parts of affected vehicles free of charge and replace them, if necessary.
