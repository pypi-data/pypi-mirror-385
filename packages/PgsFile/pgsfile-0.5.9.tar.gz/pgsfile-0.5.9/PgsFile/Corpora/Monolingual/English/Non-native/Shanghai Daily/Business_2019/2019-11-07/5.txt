2019-11-07
CHINA Southern Airlines signed a letter of intent with Rolls-Royce for purchasing and maintenance of engines at the second China International Import Expo yesterday.
The agreement includes 20 Trent XWB plane engines and maintenance services from 2019 to 2034.
The deal is meant for the 20 Airbus 350 XWB jets that China Southern ordered in 2017, the Guangzhou-based carrier said.
The first A350 was delivered to China Southern in June 2019 and the rest will be handed over by 2022.
The airline plans to mainly operate the A350 fleet out of the Beijing Daxing International Airport.
China Southern is currently operating 30 passenger aircraft equipped with the Trent engines. They include three A350s, 22 A330s, as well as five A380 Superjumbos.
