A guitar made with 400-carat diamond and 18-karat white gold is being showcased at the second China International Import Expo.
Hong Kong-based jewelry brand Coronet brought the flashy guitar to the expo. The instrument, with an estimated value of around US$2 million, is designed by Hong Kong songwriter and designer Mark Lui. It took more than 700 days to complete by a team of 68 people.
The guitar was formally unveiled at the Swiss Baselworld exhibition and attained the Guinness World Records’ title of “Most Valuable Guitar.” It is displayed with a number of valuable jewels at Hall 6.2, which hosts the precious stone pavilion, which also displays pearls from Japan, colored jewels from Thailand, jade from China and emeralds from Colombia.
