2019-03-11
CHINA will take a string of measures to maintain stable trade growth in 2019, the country’s commerce minister said on Saturday.
The Ministry of Commerce will implement a raft of trade facilitation policies and measures in export credit insurance, financing and others to reduce burdens, and improve efficiency for foreign trade companies, Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan told a press conference on the sidelines of the annual legislative session.
Efforts will also be stepped up in improving the business environment to shore up enterprises’ confidence, Zhong added.
China will promote international cooperation via the Belt and Road Initiative and explore emerging trade markets while building on traditional ones, he said.
“China’s trade is huge in scale, but not competitive enough,” Zhong said, adding that the ministry will encourage exports of high-tech, high-quality and high-value-added products.
Imports will be expanded in scale and optimized in structure to meet domestic demands, he said.
The ministry will support enterprises’ innovation in technologies, systems and management to boost market competitiveness, and encourage development of new trade businesses and models, Zhong added.
