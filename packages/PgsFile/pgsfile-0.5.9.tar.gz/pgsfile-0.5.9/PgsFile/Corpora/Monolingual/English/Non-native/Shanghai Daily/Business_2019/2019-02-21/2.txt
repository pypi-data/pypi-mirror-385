Credit growth seen strong, boosting real economy 
2019-02-21
China’s credit growth will be in the range of 13.5 percent to 14 percent in 2019, and loans from financial institutions will continue to play an important role in supporting the real economy, a new industry report says.
Given the downward pressure on the macro-economy, the liquidity within the financial system will remain at a reasonably abundant level for the whole year of 2019. But financial support for the real economy needs to be enhanced, as there will still be “bottlenecks” for the flow of funds, the financial research center at the Bank of Communications predicted.
Meanwhile, as the government is rolling out more favorable policies to boost the development of private businesses and small and micro-sized enterprises, the previously pent-up potential demand for credit is expected to be released, the report said. The Shanghai-based lender expects a gradual increase in investment in the country’s infrastructure and therefore stable growth for corporate credit lending in 2019.
Household operating loans are also predicted to grow this year, as China is advocating mass entrepreneurship and innovation in the Internet age.
Credit financing from financial institutions to companies and households rebounded steadily in 2018.
And the structure of loans also improved further over the past 12 months, it said.
Outstanding yuan loans totaled 136.3 trillion yuan (US$20.23 trillion) by year-end, up by 2.64 trillion yuan compared with the year of 2017, and loans grew by 13.5 percent for the whole year of 2018, 0.8 percentage point faster than the previous year, the bank’s research team said.
The Bank of Communications’ study noted that as much as 65 percent of credit went into enterprises.
