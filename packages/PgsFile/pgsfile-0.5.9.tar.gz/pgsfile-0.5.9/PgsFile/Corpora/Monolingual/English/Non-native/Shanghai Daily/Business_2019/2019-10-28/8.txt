LVMH makes an acquisition offer for Tiffany 
2019-10-28
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH has approached Tiffany & Co with an acquisition offer, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.
LVMH, which has for years been looking for ways to expand in the US market, submitted a preliminary, non-binding offer to Tiffany earlier this month, one of the sources said.
Tiffany has hired advisers to review LVMHâ€™s offer but has not yet responded to it. And there is no certainty that it will negotiate a deal, one of the sources added. The exact price that LVMH was offering to buy Tiffany, which has a market capitalization of US$11.9 billion, could not be learned.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. LVMH declined to comment, while Tiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg News reported earlier on Saturday that LVMH was holding talks with Tiffany.
LVMH, which is behind brands such as Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy, as well as Veuve Cliquot champagne, has stood out for years as one of the top performers in the upscale retail sector.
