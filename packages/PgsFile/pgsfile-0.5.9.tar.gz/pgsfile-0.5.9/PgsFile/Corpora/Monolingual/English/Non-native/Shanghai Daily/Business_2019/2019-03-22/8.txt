CHINA’S non-financial outbound direct investment in 1,416 overseas companies in 138 countries and regions stood at US$15.66 billion in the first two months, the Ministry of Commerce said yesterday.
Business volume in overseas-contracted projects during the first two months hit US$17.63 billion, and the value of new contracts signed reached US$22.98 billion, ministry spokesman Gao Feng said. China’s non-financial ODI in 48 countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative rose 7 percent year on year to US$2.3 billion during the period.
In the first two months, Chinese companies completed 45 cross-border mergers and acquisitions projects in 22 countries and regions, mostly in the sectors of manufacturing, finance, leasing and business services.
Gao said the structure of outbound investment continued to improve, with investment mainly going into the leasing, business services, manufacturing, retail and wholesale sectors.
The irrational tendency in outbound investment has been contained, according to the ministry. No new projects were reported in property, sports or entertainment during the period.
