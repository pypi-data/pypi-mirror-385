Redmi gets into smart TV market 
2019-09-02
Chinese smartphone brand Redmi is stepping up its expansion in full ecosystem products with a foray into the smart TV market.
Redmi on Thursday unveiled its first smart TV product that features a 70-inch screen and runs on an artificial intelligence system capable of offering personalized recommendations for users.
The smart TV is priced at 3,799 yuan (US$531.6), indicating the brand’s push for extreme performance-to-price ratio.
Redmi, a smartphone series under Xiaomi Corporation, became independent from the Xiaomi brand in January as the company seeks a multi-brand strategy to improve product portfolio. Xiaomi is China’s largest smart TV market player, whose shipments reached 5.4 million units in the first half of this year. Redmi also rolled out first-ever 64-megapixel smartphone Redmi Note Pro as well as RedmiBook 14 Pro.
