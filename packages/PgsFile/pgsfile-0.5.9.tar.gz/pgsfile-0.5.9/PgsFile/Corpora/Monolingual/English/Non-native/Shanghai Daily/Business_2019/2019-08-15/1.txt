2019-08-15
Tencent posted a 35 percent growth in profit in the second quarter to 24 billion yuan (US$3.4 billion), against a Bloomberg estimate of 21.1 billion yuan, thanks largely to  new game titles.
Revenue in the April-June quarter increased 21 percent to 88 billion yuan compared with an estimate of 93.4 billion yuan. 
Online games revenue grew by 8 percent following the release of 10 new games in the second quarter with popular launches such as Peacekeeper Elite while the personal computer business saw a decline. 
FinTech and businesses service sectors, including the cloud computing unit, saw revenue increase 37 percent to 22.9 billion yuan from commercial payment and cloud services income. 
The average transaction and total payment volume also picked up thanks to a wider merchant network for accepting mobile payment via WeChat. 
Online advertising income rose 16 percent to 16.4 billion yuan. 
Tencent is also adding content from Zhihu, a Chinese online question-and-answer site, to its social content to draw more users to spend more time on its popular smartphone social application WeChat. 
Livestreaming site YY returned to profit in the second quarter after posting losses in the same period last year.
The Guangzhou-based company said its acquisition of video site Bigo had boosted income, reporting a profit of US$3.8 million with the revenue climbing by 66.8 percent. 
Elsewhere, shares of NASDAQ-listed JD.com rose by over 12 percent on Tuesday after reporting better-than-expected Q2 profits of 619 million yuan, compared with a net loss of 2.2 billion yuan a year ago.
