The Shanghai International IT & Electronics Fair, Asia’s biggest information technology fair by space and visitor numbers, will showcase the latest technologies covering chips, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things from Tuesday. 
The fair, supported by the Shanghai government, features six sub-theme exhibitions, including Semicon China and Electronica China. 
It covers 289,000 square meters and has attracted 4,500 exhibitors and about 300,000 professional visitors.
The SIIEF has become “a world-class IT and communications platform,” Zhang Li, a senior official with the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization, said yesterday.
Last year, Shanghai’s next-generation IT industry output was 365.1 billion yuan (US$54.5 billion), a  5.8 percent rise year on year.
