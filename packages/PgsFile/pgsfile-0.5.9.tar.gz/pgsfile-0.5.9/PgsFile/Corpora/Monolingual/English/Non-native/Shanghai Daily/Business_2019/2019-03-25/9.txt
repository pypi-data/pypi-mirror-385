2019-03-25
THE newest branch of French-based high-end department store guru Galeries Lafayette has made its soft opening in Shanghai, the second in China after its first store opened in Beijing in 2013.
The company plans to open around 10 stores by 2025 in the Chinese market and will introduce its WeChat mini program in the second quarter of this year.
Covering 25,000 square meters across five floors, the store is designed to be a fashion destination, showcasing fashion pieces from around the world including domestic designer brands.
“Galeries Lafayette is expanding its footprint globally and China is a key market for future expansion and growth,” Galeries Lafayette and BHV Marais CEO Nicolas Houzé said, adding the Chinese market is expected to be the second-biggest market after France.
Houz said that the company benefits from the great relationship between the two countries and Chinese tourists account for about 20 percent of sales in Galeries Lafayette stores in France.
The company also plans to debut its WeChat mini program in the second quarter of this year, to deepen its relationship with Chinese customers, according to Philippe Pedone, international vice president of Galeries Lafayette and BHV Marais.
The new store is located in Shanghai’s Lujiazui area in the Pudong New Area, the city’s financial center transforming into a fashion hotspot.
The Shanghai flagship store is developed by Galeries Lafayette with I.T Limited through a 50-50 joint venture partnership and is expected to officially open in October this year.
Shanghai is reinventing itself as an international fashion hotspot.
More than 300 first-time-in-China stores opened in the city in 2018.
