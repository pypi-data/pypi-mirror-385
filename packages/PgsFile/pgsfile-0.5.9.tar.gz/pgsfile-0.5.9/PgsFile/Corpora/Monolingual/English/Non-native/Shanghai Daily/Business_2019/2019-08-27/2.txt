Huawei dismisses US roadblocks, pursues its clear vision of the future 
2019-08-27
Huawei launched the Ascend 910 processor and MindSpore architecture on Friday, targeting data centers, smart devices and on-device machine learning.
Huawei’s latest product releases came after it expressed disappointment at the US government’s “politically motivated” decision to add 46 Huawei affiliates to the so-called “entity list,” making it much harder for them to buy parts and components from US companies.
The US decision will not have a “substantial impact” on Huawei’s business, the company said.
Part of Huawei’s confidence comes from its research facility, including a new industrial park in Dongguan and the Huawei Developer Conference 2019 in early August, where the firm unveiled its new HarmonyOS operating system. 
The China-developed system, called Hong Meng in Chinese, has been under development since 2017.  It claims to offer greater work efficiency, a user-friendly developer environment, open sourcing and higher-level security than other systems. 
At the conference, Huawei and its partners also showed off technologies that will reshape everyday lives in the future, including autonomous driving innovations and new features for smartphones such as gesture recognition.
An unexpected typhoon and cancelled flight forced me to stay one more night in Dongguan, giving me the chance to explore the Huawei Songshan Lake Industrial Park, which cost 10 billion yuan (US$1.4 billion) to build.
It is a kind of fantasy land with castles, old-fashioned buildings, the lake and even its own railway. The park is only a 40-minute drive from Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen.
