The A-share market was steady in the first half of the year and over 200 initial public offerings are expected to be launched in 2019 with a total deal size exceeding 180 billion yuan (US$26.17 billion), PwC said yesterday.
The company released its review of the IPO market in the first half of 2019, with 64 IPOs in Shanghai and Shenzhen — marginally higher than the same period last year.
The capital raised through these offerings was down 35 percent year on year at 60.4 billion yuan.
Of the 64 IPOs, 27 were completed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, with a value of 33.1 billion yuan, while there were 12 IPOs completed on Shenzhen’s SME Board, amounting to 11.3 billion yuan.
The 25 companies listed on the Shenzhen ChiNext Board raised 16 billion yuan.
The IPOs were predominantly from companies engaged in industrial products, consumer goods and services, information technology and telecommunications.
The largest A-share IPO was Baofeng Energy, which raised more than 8 billion yuan.
Meanwhile, four banks were listed on the A-share markets in the first half of the year — Zijin Bank, Qingdao Bank, Xi’an Bank and Qingnong Commercial Bank — exceeding last year’s total.
