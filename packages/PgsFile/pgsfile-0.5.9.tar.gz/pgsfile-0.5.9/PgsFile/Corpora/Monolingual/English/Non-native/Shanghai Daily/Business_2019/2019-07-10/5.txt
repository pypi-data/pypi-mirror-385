New Apple center for developers 
2019-07-10
Apple Inc opened a Design and Development Accelerator in Shanghai yesterday, the company’s first center of its kind in China.
It will help serve 2.5 million developers in China working for applications running on Apple’s devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac and iWatch.
The center, in the Pudong New Area, provides technical support to developers through lectures, seminars, experiments, speeches, training and various community events.
Previously, Chinese developers found it difficult to contact and communicate with Apple directly as its application regulation team is not based in China.
China has more than 2.5 million Apple application developers. Since 2010, domestic developers have earned more than 200 billion yuan (US$29.4 billion) by selling applications on Apple devices globally, with over 30 percent earnings made in the past year alone.
