Robots ready to serve, from ice cream to table tennis 
2019-10-31
ROBOTS able to play table tennis, sell ice cream, chat and guide visitors will feature at the second China International Import Expo.
The technologies cover human-computer fusion, sensing, 3D printing and voice recognition and interaction.
FORPHEUS, a robot with sensing technology, will be showcased at the booth of Japan’s Omron.
It can calculate and predict the position of a ball at high speed, accurately capturing its movement and angle and “reading” information on the player, ball and racket.
Omron aims to demonstrate its vision of “harmony between man and machine.”
Roboy, a 3D-printed humanoid, will be showcased at Infineon’s booth. The German chip firm offers various chips and sensors as essential parts of the robot, such as voice-recognition speakers and laser sensors, which help the robot evaluate its environment and adjust its steps.
Roboy can hug visitors, ride a bicycle and sell ice cream. By next year, Roboy can be used to make basic medical judgments, the company said, using Infineon sensors.
Cheetah GreetBot, a robot to greet and guide visitors, will be at work during CIIE forums including the 2019 Intelligent Technology and Industry Forum for International Cooperation.
Currently, GreetBot is working in 20 fields like libraries, museums and exhibitions. The robots have served 30 million people, offering a million interactive voice services every day. Developer OrionStar is backed by New York-listed Cheetah Mobile.
Fu Sheng, Cheetah Mobile’s chairman and CEO, will speak on robot development at the technology forum, along with executives from Baidu, Huawei and SAP.
