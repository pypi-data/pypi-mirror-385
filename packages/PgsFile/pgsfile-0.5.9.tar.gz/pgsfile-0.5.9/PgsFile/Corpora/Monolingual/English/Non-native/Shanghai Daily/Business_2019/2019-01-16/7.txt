Advertising growth to slow down 
2019-01-16
Global advertising spending growth is expected to slow to 3.8 percent in 2019, to US$625 billion, amid a relatively benign economic environment and a broad-based recovery, according to Dentsu Aegis Networkâ€™s latest advertising spending forecast. 
That compares with 4.1 percent seen in 2018. Advertising spend growth in China is projected to be 7 percent, lower than the 7.8 percent a year ago, at 717 billion yuan (US$105.4 billion) fuelled by the continued expansion of domestic consumption. 
However, growth is expected to be further dampened in 2020 at an estimated 6.4 percent due to economic uncertainty. 
The pace of ad spend growth for the global market is also set to rebound to 4.3 percent in 2020. 
Last year, pharmaceuticals were the top industry in terms of ad spend in China at over 125 billion yuan.
