Car recalls crash after airbag issue fixed 
2019-01-03
Chinese automakers recalled more than 12 million defective cars in 2018, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said yesterday.
That is a drop of more than 40 percent from 20.05 million in 2017.
The improvement is largely due to a decrease in defective Takata airbags, which were recalled because some exploded when deployed.
About 11.34 million cars were recalled in 2016.
“With the rising awareness of domestic automakers and the increasing complexity of automobile products, recalls are becoming more and more frequent,” said Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.
“(But) in 2018, the overall recalls were stable relative to previous years,” Cui said.
Cui added that recalls have become a mature mechanism to solve vehicle problems, protect the public and help the automobile industry.
The number of recalls due to problems of engines, transmission systems and brake systems was relatively high in 2018. 
Since 2016, seat belts and airbags have been the main reasons for recalls — accounting for more than half all recalls in 2017 and 2016.
Takata airbags were the main cause of recalls in 2017.
Yan Fengmin, head of the law enforcement department of the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, said that Takata airbags that may explode under certain conditions and caused 29 automakers to recall 9.87 million vehicles in 2017.
Cui said 480,000 vehicles were recalled in December.
Most of those were for faulty electrics and engines.
