Suning at Carrefour 
2019-09-18
Suning is opening home-appliance mini stores at Carrefour outlets to expand its offline retail channel after acquiring an 80 percent stake in Carrefour China. 
Over 200 mini stores will be operational by the end of this month and about 31 Carrefour outlets in Shanghai will have a special home-appliance section. Suning will leverage its merchandising advantages to target shoppers at the Carrefour stores. Carrefour has 210 hypermarkets in 22 provinces since entering China in 1995 but consumer sentiment has weakened recently with the popularization of online delivery services for groceries and daily use items.
