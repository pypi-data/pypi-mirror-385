I am, you know! I am! I AM!
Three, you are not taller than me.
I am. Look.
See? Taller. Taller!
That's not being taller, that's jumping. Stand still a minute.
See? We're just the same height. 
Maybe.
Like your singing, Five. 
I bet I could sing for longer than you, though. 
Oh, no!
I could sing for ages... starting NOW!
A-a-a-g-h.
I'm going mad!
A call coming in, a call coming in!
Let's go!
Got an agent ringing in to help.
Agent 16 here. I think I've spotted a problem.
OK. Tell us about it. 
There's a boy having trouble with his pencil.
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
AGENT 16: See? Pretty weird!
Don't worry, we'll be right there. 
Great!
What's the problem? A nice long pencil. What's wrong with that?
But WHY is it growing longer? 
I don't know.
We HAVE to know so we can put things right.
I'll go and put things right. 
You're not a big enough number
to go out there. 
Huh!
How about you, Four? 
I'm not sure.
I'll do the scanner if Four's going out. 
Oh, all right.
Number Four! 
ALARM WAILS
Are you all right up there? 
Yeah.
Are you sure you're ready?
Yes. 
GO!
Three, are you going to check it's all clear for launching. 
Oh, yeah.
All clear! 
Let's go!
I wish I could do that. 
Three, you've got to find a 4 for him to land on!
Oh, yeah.
I can't find a 4, I can't find a 4!
I'll call agent 16.
Agent 16 here.
Quick! Get the boy to write a 4!
Why? 
We need an emergency number for Four to land on.
Four's running out of energy!
'The pencil's getting too long. It's hard to write.
'He's got to write a 4. 
Come on! He's got to do it!'
He's done it!
We've got a 4 to land on, Four.
Can you see why the pencil's growing? 
No.
Agents ringing in to help.
Agent 28 here. You've got to know more about what's going on.
Find out exactly what made that pencil get longer.
Agent 53. Look really closely.
Closely, eh?
OK, then.
Look! Slime! 
Slime?
Not just any slime. A blob of slime from the Problem Blob.
Putting it on screen.
Uh-oh
Blubbery
Eugh! 
Do you think you can deal with the Problem Blob
if it comes back, Four?
Er... I'm not quite sure.
Well, you need to sort this pencil out first.
Oh, agents ringing in!
That pencil's too long. You've got to make it the opposite.
You've got to make it shorter.
Short is the opposite of long.
The pencil's getting even longer. I'm going to need some help here.
Get the Brain Gain machine going. 
I can do it. Just watch me!
Getting brain power now!
We need to make things shorter. 
I got it! Shorter. Shorter.
Getting you lots of Brain Gain. 
Shorter. Shorter. Shorter! Shorter!
Sending Brain Gain.
Yes! Shorter. Shorter!
Ha!
HE MOUTHS
Well done, Four! Yeah! 
You did it, Four.
Well, perhaps I'll pop back home now.
You must sort out the Problem Blob first.
Oh, will I?
Another call coming in.
Oh, dear.
I've got another problem. Something else is getting longer.
Putting it on screen.
MAN WHISTLES
CREAKING
I bet it's that Problem Blob again.
Prob-ob blob-ob-ob!
There it is! 
Burp!
It's splatting slime.
Where did the slime go?
SPLAT! On the mop! Problem slime.
CREAKING
I'm on my way!
MOP CREAKS
MOP TAPS CEILING
The Problem Blob's up there! 
Prob-blob. 
Oh, dear.
It's made the man's mop grow longer and longer.
Ow!
Oh, no! That mop could get longer and longer and end up anywhere!
Someone's nose might get longer.
Atchoo!
Or the dancing cow might get longer!
Moo!
Or a bike might get longer.
Oh! Oh!
Or it might get taller.
Whoa!
Whargh!
We must stop that Problem Blob!
Bthzz bthzz blllrrpt! Bthzzpht!
UNHEARD CONVERSATION
SPLAT!
STRAW CREAKS
Sending you more Brain Gain.
Shorter! Shorter!
I'm going to need lots.
Let's get some agents to help.
AGENTS: 
Shorter. Shorter.
Ah!
Done it! 
Now, shrink the Problem Blob.
Shorter! Shorter!
AGENTS: 
Shorter. Shorter. Shorter. Shorter.
Aim at the Blob!
That's really short!
Shorter! Shorter! 
That's enough, Three.
Oh, no! That's too much shortening!
Now what do we do?
AGENTS: 
Longer. Longer.
Longer!
Longer!
MOP CREAKS
NUMBERJACKS: Yey-hey! Whoo-hoo! Whoa-ho! Hurrah! Yes!
That's it! 
Bringing you back Number Four.
Don't mind if you do.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One, two, three, four!
Well done, Four. 
You sorted everything out.
Yeah? 
Look.
That pencil getting longer. 
Lucky he wrote a four for you to land on.
FOUR: 
That's me!
It was all that Problem Blob's fault.
Always making trouble that Blob is.
And we all had lots of work to do.
But there were lots more problems.
Brain Gain sorted them out!
And sorted out the Problem Blob. 
ALL: Yeah! 
Did the trick.
Thanks to everyone who helped. 
I helped a bit too much.
And everything back to normal.
Are you sure everything's back to normal? 
Yes. Look!
See? The pencil is just the same length as all the others now.
But what about the mop? Are we sure it's back to normal?
Yeah, look. He's got a twin brother with a twin mop.
See? Same length. Everything back to normal.
Those twins were just the same height. 
Just like you and me.
That's worth singing about. -- Oh, no!
Can you find two things that are the same height or two the same length?
If you can, call the Numberjacks.
I can! You know I can!
You can't, Three! 
I can do it! Me! Me! Me!
Ooh!
I can keep this boing-ball going for ages!
You can't because you talk too much! 
I do not talk too much!
See? 
I meant to do that.
Anyway, we're not supposed to play boing-ball in here.
I'm only playing keepy-uppy.
It's not like I was giving the ball a big boing like this...
Oh, no!
AGH!
We've got to stop it!
OK, one, two, three...!
Done it!
You're not playing boing-ball in here, are you?
No...
Did the trick! 
Wow!
That's the difference between being a six and a three.
WHIRRING
An agent calling in!
We've got a call!
Agent 28 here! Things are going wrong!
But not for long! 
A girl has a problem with her marble run!
What's happening? 
It was working well...
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
It should be like this. 
That looks fine.
But the girl's marbles are going wrong! 
It's not a very big problem.
It could be the start of something bigger! 
You're right! I'm going out!
Number Six!
SIREN
Checking all is clear.
All clear!
One day... One day...
Looking for a six to land on!
Got a six!
We've got you on the screen. 
OK. Checking if we have more problems.
Eh? My peas!
Sounds like I've found one. Just going to have a look.
Whoa!
My orange!
Definitely problems here.
That's very funny food.
There's something strange going on. 
Yes. We need to know more about it!
Can anyone help think about these things? What's happened to them?
Agents ringing in to help!
The things have all had their shape changed.
Agent 101 here. They're all the same shape as this building block.
We need to know exactly what we're dealing with. We need a name!
Agent 70 here! I think these shapes are called cubes!
Cubes! They're cubes!
Right, I need to have a closer look at those peas!
Try not to be seen. 
I'll use the menu for cover.
Look at those peas! Something has changed them!
What? 
I don't know yet.
First, we've got to change them back to the shape they were before.
But what shape were they before? 
Agents ringing in to help.
They were all round.
They were all shaped like a ball.
Anyone know the name of the shape?
Spheres. Shapes like that are called spheres.
Let's change that shape!
Get ready to change the shapes back to spheres.
Going for Brain Gain!
OK, we're changing cubes into spheres.
Cubes into spheres! Cubes into spheres!
OK. I'd better check out the orange.
Cube back to sphere!
Cube back to sphere!
OK. Just got to sort out the marble run now.
We're getting signs of more problems with spheres.
It's either in the pet shop,
or in the sports hall.
I need to know where to go. 
Which is it likely to be?
Where are there lots of spheres -- the pet shop or the sports centre?
The sports centre has lots of balls. 
I'm on my way.
If things keep turning from spheres into cubes,
anything could happen.
Bubbles might turn into cubes!
Or the sun might change from a sphere to a cube!
Or down here on Earth,
what's going to happen to a football?
There's loads of balls here!
I'm getting a signal from the... table tennis!
OK.
I bet I know what's making things go wrong!
What? 
The Shape Japer!
On the screen!
The Shape Japer's back!
Changing size
Look!
CACKLING
The Shape Japer!
MORE CACKLING
It's changing all the balls into cubes!
All the games are being ruined!
I'm going to sort that Shape Japer out!
Brain Gain coming!
Cubes into spheres! Cubes into spheres! 
Round those corners!
We need all the help we can get!
Yes!
CHEERING
Done it! 
Yes! Come on back, Number Six!
Where's Six gone?
He's still got the marble run to sort out.
I think there's a Shape Japer on the marble run!
I'm going to have to shrink right down to find it.
Careful.
Brain Gain! 
Cube into sphere! Cube into sphere into nothing!
Done it!
Oh, no!
Get out of there!
He's too tired!
Thanks!
Come back now, Six.
All clear for landing! One... two...
three... four... five... six!
Hurray!
That girl saved you! 
We help people and sometimes, people help us.
We've got it all on screen. This is what it looked like.
The peas turned into cubes and so did the orange.
It needed lots of Brain Gain to sort all those out.
Ah, the Shape Japer!
All the cubes turned back into spheres!
And then it was you in the marble run! 
Liked that trick.
Well, I'm glad that was sorted out. Ah!
Maybe we should turn this sphere into a cube!
Oh, no! Not my boing-ball!
Maybe we'll just put it away safely.
Safe inside a cube.
OK.
Calling all agents. Check if you've got any spheres where you live,
and if you have, call the Numberjacks!
No problem is too small
Oh, go on, go on, go on, go on, please!
I'm sorry, you're too small a number.
You go out, and Six and Four.
We're all bigger numbers than you. 
But I want to go OUT.
You've got loads of things to play with here.
Oh, have I? I better get some toys out to play with then.
Get my collection of beautiful shapes OUT.
Huh!
You're making a terrible mess.
Oh, sorry. Just getting a few things OUT!
Maybe I'll get the bowling ball OUT!
Oh, no. 
Calm that ball down.
Sorry, that's OUT of my control.
Three, you've got to tidy things up.
Well, I will if...
BEEPING We've got a call! 
Come on!
Someone's spotted a problem!
I'll go out and sort it!
'Agent 70 here.'
Things are going wrong!
But not for long! 
Tell us all about it.
A girl is having trouble with her pencil case.
Hold on! I'm putting it on screen.
Tell us more!
'Look what happens when she puts them in her pencil case.
'They keep popping out.' 
The pens like being outside.
I 
know how they feel. 
Sh-sh-sh!
Thanks, Agent 70. We'll send someone out to have a look.
Thanks!
Send ME out! Send ME out!
Well, MAYBE you can go out...
Really?! 
.. with me.
Hmmm. 
And tidy up all the mess when you get back.
Course I will!
Well, whoever is going, get going!
I'm going! Yes!
Five and three!
ALARM SOUNDS
Right. 
You don't have to come, you know.
Oh, yes I do! I can do it. Just watch me.
At least we'll get a bit of peace.
Checking it's all clear for launching.
All clear!
Ready?
Go!
Oh, wee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
Finding a three and a five to land on.
BEEPING
Got some threes and fives. 
Can you get them both together?
I'm looking.
Found a 35!
That's convenient.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! 
All right? 
Fine.
Come on, then. 
I'm out, I'm out and about!
Aa-aa-hh!
Come on, three!
Can they see me back at base? 
Yes.
I'm out and about!
We've got a job to do. 
This is so exciting!
Don't worry. We'll soon get this sorted.
Well, I'd better investigate.
Careful, three. 
I'm not afraid.
Watch this!
Oh!
You did say that you liked being OUTside.
But I want to choose when.
I think I can safely say there is something funny going on here.
BEEPING
Another agent ringing in!
'Agent 94 here.'
There's something going on here. Look!
Hi.
Oh, that's very rude!
'I don't think he meant to do it.
Three! Five! You better get over there.
He's going to get into trouble.
'It's getting worse!'
Oh!
'That's SO embarrassing!'
Maybe there's a link between them all.
What's the same about all of these problems?
They're all things that have popped out.
The things should be in, but they're out.
Things you want inside are outside.
So we know what the problem is. 
But not what caused it.
I'm sure we'll find out.
Well, we've certainly found something.
I'm the Puzzler. Look at me.
You might learn from what you see.
We're looking.
Get ready for a strange surprise.
Watch my mouth and nose and eyes.
Everything in its right place inside the circle of my face.
Now this is a strange thing to do.
But maybe, somehow, it's a clue.
It's a bit of a hard clue.
Here's where things were found before.
But now I've moved them. That's for sure!
See you later!
The Puzzler made things on his face go outside.
And that's making everything else go outside instead of inside.
Like the man and his car.
He's trying to get IN his car.
Oh, no!
'He wants to get INside and go home.
'But he keeps popping out.
We've got to help this man!
And if we don't sort this problem, anything could happen.
As well as your tongue...
your teeth might pop out!
And then chase you!
TEETH CHATTER
And when you're warm and cosy in bed...
you might get popped OUT of bed!
And your whole bedroom might be popped outside!
HE WHIMPERS
Let's sort this problem out.
Oh, no you can't!
Oh! 
Oh, no!
It's a puzzle bubble! 
What do we know about the Puzzler and bubbles?
I'm searching for info on the Puzzler.
Let me tell you what I'm talking about!
Oh, yeah!
Three and five are trapped in the puzzle bubble.
Who did this?
Well, who did this? Now, let me see.
Oh, I remember. It was me!
And now, my friends, you are in trouble.
You're trapped inside my puzzle bubble!
We're not scared of you, Puzzle Bubble. 
Aren't we?
Tell us your puzzle and we'll burst your bubble.
I hope your brains are working well.
Will you succeed? Well, time will tell.
Look at these numbers. You will see, We're missing one. What can it be?
Work it out! And then tell me.
Or never, ever, will you go free.
Come on! What number goes in the middle?
I don't know!
What number? What number?!
Don't panic. 
We need some help!
Agents ringing in.
Look at it carefully.
Look at the puzzle one bit at a time.
What are the numbers on each line?
Don't let the puzzle worry you.
But be quick! I have to hurry you.
Quick!
In the top line, there's a one and a two and a three.
And in the bottom line, there's a three, a one and a two.
All the numbers, as well! 
So what's missing in the middle line?
I know!
Hey, Mr Puzzler.
Ye-e-e-e-e-es.
Yeah, um, I know what it's got to be.
That's number three!
That number's me!
TWINKLING
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
What about the pencil case?
That's better.
Another of my puzzles is solved.
So, till next time, I'll say...
HE VIBRATES HIS LIPS
.. so long!
What a very strange person!
You can come back now, three and five.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One, two, three, four, five!
Well done, three and five! 
You sorted the problems out.
And the Puzzler. 
Remember for next time.
Those pens were a bit silly.
So was I!
That man was very silly.
Everything that should be inside was outside!
Could be a whole new look!
That Puzzler was a bit scary.
And we were stuck in a puzzle bubble.
But we sorted HIM out.
There was a three missing from the middle line. 
Not for long!
ALL: Yeah! 
Did the trick.
Not everything's sorted in this place.
Oh, no! 
You said you'd tidy it up.
Oh!
Outside back inside!
Hurray!
OK, agents. Keep your eyes open
for things that are inside something else.
How many things can you find?
Any problems, call the Numberjacks.
Right. Are you ready to play Thinky-Jump? 
I can do it.
I'm not sure. What are the rules again?
Look at the pictures...
A dog.
A cow.
And another dog.
Now jump to join the two pictures that go together.
The two dogs go together.
I get it.
Try these. Think then jump.
A train. Right.
A plane. OK.
And a flower.
I suppose the plane and the train go together -- people travel on them.
Four! 
What?
You're supposed to jump.
Oh! I was busy thinking.
It's called Thinky-Jump.
You have to think and then jump.
My turn now! Me, me, me!
Ready...
Bird.
Fish.
I did great jumping.
But not much thinking.
You've got to think AND jump.
Which things go together? Watch.
Apple.
Truck.
Banana.
Apple... banana.
They go together because they are fruits. You can eat them.
You couldn't eat a truck!
It would hurt your teeth if you tried. 
I'd try it.
YOU probably would.
Agents calling in! 
Come on!
Someone's spotted a problem!
Agent 16 here.
I think I've spotted a problem.
Hold on! I'm putting it on screen.
There's a boy wearing very strange clothes.
Looks very strange!
And there's this girl...
I can't see that look catching on!
Right, we'd better get someone out there.
Five knows about fashion.
OK. I'll go. 
The Numberjacks are on their way.
Number Five!
ALARM
Are you ready, Five? 
I'm fine.
Checking it's all clear for launching...
All clear!
Ready... go!
ALL: Five... four... three... two... one... zero!
Finding you a 5 to land on.
Found a 5!
OK, Five?
I'm fine. And off to sort those clothes out.
Can you see them? 
Yup! They've got a serious problem with their clothes.
What is it?
Agents ringing in.
The girls clothes are for a man!
The clothes don't go with the person who's wearing them.
Something has been messing about with these clothes.
Another call!
Quick! We've got more problems -- more things that don't belong.
Five, you'd better investigate.
I don't think that little person is reading that paper.
They're both in a place where they don't belong.
This could get very dangerous. Who's doing it?
I think I can guess. Look!
Oh, no! Spooky Spoon! 
What do we know about her?
Here's the info on Spooky Spoon! 
Oh-oh! 
One... two... three...
Spooky Spoon! 
Five, you've GOT to stop her.
Argh!
It's that horrible Numberjack, Five.
I wonder what you're doing here.
I'm here to stop you mixing things up so they don't belong. 
Really(?)
Well, in that case, you are going to be very disappointed
because you can't stop me!
SHE LAUGHS
You've got to stop mixing things up.
Oh, I don't think so.
I think I've got to do it more
and more
and MORE!
No! 
Oh, yes.
Like this...
Let's see what else I can mix up!
Ha-ha-ha-argh...
I just love mixing things up so they don't belong.
Yes, that's me, Spooky Spoon!
We've got to do something, Five.
I know.
If Spooky Spoon goes on mixing things up, anything could happen.
She might start mixing things up
so creatures are in places where they don't belong.
And a hamster can't swim in water, like a fish.
The dancing cow is happy grazing in a field...
but a shark wouldn't be!
The birds are happy flying in the sky.
But the dancing cow can't become the flying cow.
CRASH!
We must stop Spooky Spoon putting things where they don't belong.
What's Spooky Spoon going to mix up next?
How boring!
Everything belongs together!
Hmm. Time for some mixing.
Mix!
Mix!
Mix!
Mix!
Argh!
Mix...
Mix!
Argh!
Mix!
What can we do? 
Don't eat at that cafe, for a start.
This is serious, Four. 
How can Five get things back to normal?
Agents ringing in!
Spooky Spoon has mixed everything up.
Five has to un-mix them.
Get the things that belong together back together.
Stop the mixing, start the matching.
OK, Five, you've got to get matching.
Putting things back where they belong. 
I'll send some Brain Gain.
Brain Gain! Brain Gain! The sort of proper computer brain.
The way to get your brains linking up together, joined-up thinking.
Getting brain power now! Brain Gain!
Got to get some matching Brain Gain.
Think matching! Think matching! Think matching!
Match all the sporting things together!
No!
Yes.
Match all the cleaning things.
You always spoil things for me!
Good!
Match all the food things together.
Oh, you think you're so clever, Five.
With help from my friends, yes, I can beat you!
But I can go off wherever I like
and mix things anywhere.
We'll find a way of stopping you. 
Oh, yes? How?!
Agents ringing in!
Trap her in a circle.
Trap her in a circle with other things that match.
We're going to trap you, Spooky Spoon.
You'll never do that.
There's nothing like Spooky Spoon.
Nothing can match with me.
We've got to find something that matches a spoon. 
Quick! Any ideas?
We need two things that Spooky Spoon matches with. 
Scanning the cafe...
Are there things that match with the spoon? Anything she belongs with?
Agents ringing in.
Match the spoon with the knife -- they're both for eating with.
Match the spoon with the fork, too.
Match them! Get them together
with a super-strong circle.
Fork... spoon... knife...
No! What?!
You're trapped, Spooky Spoon, with the other things for eating with.
No! I am not like other things.
Oh, yes, you are. You're all things to eat with. You are matched!
Oh, no...
SHE SOBS
Now I can sort out all the things you've mixed up.
Come back now, Five.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One... two... three... four... five...
Well done, Five.
You sorted Spooky Spoon out. 
Thinks she's better than everyone else,
but she's just another thing to eat with. 
On the screen!
There they are, in the funny clothes.
Don't eat it. 
Not very healthy food.
You cannot clean things with a pizza. 
Or play tennis with a mop.
Agh! There's Spooky Spoon!
Five sorted her.
Everything back, matching where it belongs.
Spooky Spoon trapped in the circle with all the things she matches.
All the things for eating with. 
Well done, Five. 
ALL: Yeah!
It's lucky the agents thought of things to match the spoon with.
Yes!
Knife... spoon... fork!
We found three things that match.
Things that you eat food with.
Can you find three things that belong together in a different way?
If you know, or have any problems, call the Numberjacks.
Does everybody know the rules?
Yes, yes, yes. 
I'm not sure.
Close your eyes and listen for the Bloop Ball.
BLOOP!
If you hear your number, you have to head the ball without looking.
Will it hurt for me? I haven't got a very big head.
That's cos you haven't got a very big brain.
We'll show you how to do it.
BLOOP!
One...
BLOOP!
.. two...
BLOOP! 
.. three...
BLOOP! 
.. four... five...
six!
BLOOP!
See? Six bloops! 
You mean, "LISTEN. Six bloops!"
Right, your turn to listen.
It could be three bloops or four. Listen and count.
OK, OK, OK!
BLOOP!
One...
BLOOP!.. two...
BLOOP!.. three! 
Wait!
Ah!
Hey, there were three bloops! 
Yes, and then a fourth one! 
So...
You've got to wait for the last bloop for the number.
Agents calling in! 
Sorry, Bloop Ball. We've gotta go.
We'll be back.
We've got a call.
Agent 28 here! There's something going wrong!
Not for long. 
Tell us the problem.
The girl's got a problem with her clock. 
I'm putting it on screen!
Can you see the problem?
A missing number!
There's Three and there's Five, but no Four!
I'm missing! 
Sounds like a good clock to me. 
Oh, you!
Missing numbers are always a problem and can grow into bigger problems.
We're sending someone out. 
Great! 
We're on our way. 
Thanks.
OK, who's going out there?
Why is everybody looking at ME? 
Cos the missing number was Four.
So you'd better sort the problem.
I'm not sure. 
You can do it, Four, and while you're gone,
WE'LL be the ones who are missing Four. 
Aw!
OK, this is a mission for Number Four.
NUMBER FOUR!
SIREN
Good luck, Four. 
Thank you. I'll need it.
Checking everything is clear.
All clear. 
Stand by, Four! 
Off you go!
Four... three... two... one...
zero!
Scanning for a Four to land on.
Hurry up, Five. 
I'm looking. 
Four has got to have somewhere to land!
Whoa...!
Where have all the fours gone? 
Got a Four!
On screen! 
Just in time!
You had me worried. 
Sorry. All the fours seem to have disappeared.
You're right.
You'd better be careful, Four!
You're telling ME! Look!
Ah!
The Numbertaker! What do we know about him!
Watch out, Four! He might take you!
Phew!
Agents calling in!
You've got to go to that girl's house or the party will be ruined!
Right. I'll deal with the Numbertaker...
.. later.
She looks sad.
It's because of the clock. Her party is supposed to start at four o'clock
but we don't know when it will be four o'clock.
You've got to sort that clock, Four.
(I'll do my best. Here goes...)
Well done, Four. Now she can have her party.
She hasn't noticed me. 
Make a noise. 
What noise? 
Like a clock!
Uh... cuckoo! Cuckoo! 
Not a cuckoo clock!
Hurray!
It's party time! 
Wait! That big birthday card!
I'll do it.
Oh, no! The cake! The Four's gone from that, too!
Oh, no!
You'll be all right, Four.
Oh, no! 
Just keep still, Four.
He'll be all right now. 
Phew.
Watch out, Four!
I need a rest after all that.
No time for that! More calls!
We've got more problems!
Number Four is disappearing? 
No. Things are disappearing!
What's going on? 
Why did the bowling balls go? And the parcels?
Agents ringing in to help!
The balls went from the bowling alley cos there were four of them!
The Numbertaker likes taking numbers. Now he's taking number fours.
And he's taking FOUR things at a time, like the parcels.
Thanks, agents.
Things are disappearing when there's four of them.
Gotta find that Numbertaker!
There he is at the cafe! 
Better get down there, Four!
OK.
If we don't stop the Numbertaker, anything could happen.
The Numbertaker might take the four legs from a chair.
And the four legs from the table!
Or he might take the four fences of a field.
And the dancing cow might go dancing off!
And then the Numbertaker might take her legs!
Better sort that Numbertaker out quick!
Be careful, Four! 
I will. Don't worry.
Watch out. There's two glasses...
Three... four!
Watch out!
GLASS SHATTERS
Don't let the Numbertaker see you! He likes Fours!
Don't worry. I've got three menus to hide me.
Oh, no! Four menus!
Agh! 
He's coming for you, Four!
Help! What can I do?
Make him look for a different Four! 
Like what?
I've got it!
We can't send four things!
We can send four noises. Think of the Bloop Ball -- four sounds!
Bloop-bloop-bloop-bloop! Bloop-bloop-bloop-bloop!
Sending Brain Gain!
If you like things that come in fours, Numbertaker, here you go!
Bloop-bloop-bloop-bloop!
Bloop-bloop-bloop-bloop!
Now we need four people to sort the Numbertaker out. 
We can get them!
One...
two...
three...
four!
Let's see him try to suck up those four!
They're too big to take, Numbertaker!
He's gone! 
And things are back to normal.
Come back now, Four.
All clear for landing!
One... two... three... four...!
Well done, Four! 
That Numbertaker is strange.
We've got it on screen. The clock was the first thing.
And the cake!
Careful, Four!
It's dangerous everywhere when the Numbertaker is about.
Everything in fours.
He nearly caught you, Four!
And four things he couldn't deal with -
four angry people!
We did it!
Ready, Four? I think it might be your turn.
BLOOP!
One...
BLOOP!
.. two...
BLOOP! 
.. three... four!
BLOOP!
Well done, Four! 
I kept my eyes shut and everything!
Yes. You can count things by looking and you can count by listening.
Is there any other way you can count things?
How can YOU count without looking or listening?
If you can think how to do it, or if you have any problems,
call Numberjacks!
OK, we're going to practise our jumping. You ready, Four?
I'm not sure. 
You'll be fine.
There are so many different directions to jump in.
Going for four directions. Get ready for the light flashing.
BLEEPING 
Front of you.
This side or that side.
Could be behind you. OK?
Think so.
Watch for the flash and jump!
BLEEPING 
Watching.
In front! 
BEEP
Great! Get ready again.
BEEPING 
Side! 
Keep going.
BEEPING 
Oh, other side.
Oh, I...
This is hard. 
Quick!
Behind! Oh!
Never mind, you did really well. Got three out of four.
I bet you'll get four. 
Hope not. Hope I'll get six!
I'm going for six directions. Watch.
BEEPING 
Forward. Side. Side. Back.
Well done!
Down... and up.
MUSIC PLAYS 
Yes!
All six directions. 
That's because I'm Number Six. 
Brilliant.
ALARM RINGS 
Come on!
ALARM CONTINUES TO RING
We've got a call.
Agent 85 here. 
What's up?
Things are going wrong. 
But not for long! Just in time...
It's only a small problem. 
Small problems get bigger. What is it?
It's all these boxes. 
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
That looks all right.
It's not that box, it's this one.
That box isn't much good. 
And this one isn't either.
Right, we'll send someone to sort this out. 
Thanks very much.
Who's going? 
This could be one for you, Five. 
OK.
But somehow, I think it's a job for me.
OK, Six is going. 
Get ready for launching.
Go! Go!
SIRENS BLARE
Good luck, Six. 
Ready for launch. Checking the room's empty.
All clear, apart from Jasper the cat. 
Jasper won't mind. Let's go.
ALL: Six, five,
four, three, two, one...
zero!
Looking for a six to land on.
Gotta six!
Those boxes don't look very good at all.
I'll try and see what's the matter with the boxes. Can you see?
Calling all agents, any ideas?
Agent 33, here. That box has got one side missing.
These boxes need four sides.
OK, anything else they need?
Boxes need a bottom too, to stop things falling out.
OK, four sides and a bottom. Anything else a box needs?
The top. 
OK, four sides, a bottom and a top, we can fix that.
We've got more problems with boxes. You better come quick!
OK, I'm on my way.
There's going to be more problems.
Those boxes look fine.
Oh, that one doesn't.
What's wrong with that box? 
It's got four sides, a top and a bottom.
What's wrong with it?
You've got the right number of sides but they're all different.
The sides are all wonky. They don't fit together with square corners.
Wonky boxes don't stack very well.
Don't think that's going to stack up either.
Oh, no! The boxes are all going wrong! 
What's going on there?
I think I know. Look!
Oh, no the shape-japer! 
What do we know about the shape-japer?
Searching for info on the shape-japer.
SPOOKY MUSIC
Looks like the shape-japer's back! 
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
That shape-japer's always changing things. 
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
And now, she's changing boxes.
We've got to sort this out.
Let's get those boxes back to normal. 
What those boxes need is...
Brain Gain!
Right!
Boxes back to normal, boxes back to normal.
These boxes need four sides. 
A bottom. 
And sometimes a top.
Sending Brain Gain now...
ZAAAP!
Boxes back to normal! 
PZAAAP!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Still got to sort out the boxes with funny corners.
More Brain Gain needed.
No more wonky sides and funny corners!
Make those corners square. Make those corners square.
Sending Brain Gain.
Boxes, boxes, boxes, boxes! 
You can stop now, Three.
Four sides, top and bottom, nice square cornered-boxes.
ZZZ-AAAPPPS
We've got too much Brain Gain now. 
Oh, dear.
I think we're going to end up with too many boxes.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yes, look!
Oh, no!
If things keep getting put into boxes, anything could happen.
There might be a snake gets put in a box.
A very long thin box.
Or traffic lights might be put in a box.
A very tall thin box.
BIRDS SING
Or a tree might be in a box.
Or anything could happen!
We don't want any extra boxes. 
We can send more Brain Gain to Six.
Just one problem. 
What? 
Where is Six? I've lost contact with him.
I'm sure he's somewhere nearby but I can't see him.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh, no! 
We've got to find Six. Where can he be?
I'm looking... Any ideas?
I think Six is in that box.
Of course. 
I'll try and get a link inside.
Come on! 
I'll try that.
Can you hear us, Six? 
Yes, just about. What's happening?
There's boxes everywhere and you're inside one. 
I know!
We can send you some Brain Gain and hit the box from the outside.
And I'll hit it from the inside. We can do it together.
We've got to get Six out of that box.
I'm thinking out of the box, Brain Gain.
Hit the top fast. 
Get rid of that box!
Start with the top. Come on, Six.
No top!
Now the sides.
One...
two...
three...
four!
And no more bottom. No more box!
Great! Now sort out the other boxes.
No tops, no sides and no bottoms.
And one last thing to sort out.
No top, no sides and no bottom. 
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
No top, no sides and no bottom.
PZZAP! Uh-oh...
Sorted that shape-japer!
Come on back, Six.
Checking the roof's clear... Not even Jasper the cat.
ALL: One, two, three, four, five, six!
Well done, Six. 
I'm sorry about all the extra boxes.
Especially the one you were in. 
Well, never mind that now.
This is what it looked like.
Her boxes started it all off. 
She's got a lot of stuff.
That's why she needs proper boxes.
A box is no good without four good sides.
And a bottom. 
And sometimes a top too.
Those were very strange boxes. Corners not square, no good at all. 
We sorted the boxes out but then there were too many of them.
Lucky there was lots of air in my box.
There was lots of jumping in your box.
And we sorted out the boxes. ALL: Yeah.
And the shape-japer. 
ALL: Yeah!
And everything back to normal.
No, it's not quite normal. 
What?
It's too quiet. 
That's because Three isn't around. 
Where is Three?
Has anyone ever seen that box before? 
I wonder what's inside it? 
Me! 
Whoa! 
I'm a Numberjack-in-the-box!
Oh! 
I scared you didn't I? 
No! 
I did, I did!
Can you get a grown-up to help protect the boxes in your home?
Four sides, a bottom, maybe a top.
How many different boxes can you find? Let us know.
Or any problems -
call the Numberjacks.
No problem is too small
All right now, we're playing skittles... 
Yeah!
But we've got to take turns.
Oh... oh, all right. 
One goes first.
First. 
Then after One, it's Two, going second.
Second. 
And then it's me!
Yes, Three, you go third.
Well, come on, then. Let's do it. My body blocks are fed up waiting.
Right, One goes first.
No, that's the wrong direction!
Never mind.
Me next!
No! You're after Two.
Oh, it's so exciting!
Wait for the body blocks...
to be ready.
Oh, they weren't ready.
Yes, when the body blocks are ready, THEN it's time to bowl the ball.
Right, I'm ready to bowl!
Ready, body blocks?
Here we go!
Oh-oh.
I would've got some.
They just got too excited.
Oh, no. Oh, no! You shouldn't get too excited. No!
BEEPING 
Agent calling in!
We've got a problem!
Don't get excited. 
I AM excited. 
So am I.
Agent 47 here. Something's going wrong.
But not for long! 
Tell us about it.
This boy can't blow bubbles.
Hold on! I'm putting it on screen.
What's going wrong? 
Look! 
He hasn't got any bubble stuff on there.
No point blowing without bubble stuff.
Do YOU want to go and sort it? 
I do.
OK, Agent 47, the Numberjacks are on their way!
Who's going out there? 
Number Five!
ALARM SOUNDS
Checking it's all clear for launching.
Just Jasper the cat.
He won't mind. Let's go!
ALL: Five, four, three, two, one, zero!
Find a good five to land on!
Got some fives...
Found a five!
OK, Five? 
I'm fine.
Time to sort that problem out.
What do you make of it, Five?
There's something he's got to do first. 
What is it?
Agents ringing in.
You've got to do things in the right order.
Right. 
He's blowing it first and dipping it in the stuff second.
It should be the other way around -- dip and blow.
We can sort that out.
Another agent!
Agent 88 here. There are more problems next door.
OK.
That was completely out of order.
This is NOT the right order to clean your teeth.
What's making everything happen in the wrong order?
I think I know. Look!
SHE SINGS
SHE LAUGHS
I know that laugh.
It's Spooky Spoon!
Check out the data on Spooky Spoon!
Oh-oh. 
Spooky Spoon! 
You've got to stop her!
Oooh! What have we here?
Eugh. Numberjack Two, isn't it?
Numberjack Five, actually.
Ooh, sorry, I'm sure.
Have you been mixing things up again, Spooky Spoon? 
Oh!
Well, since you ask, yes.
YE-EE-EE-SS!
I've been mixing things up because that is what I do.
I am Spooky Spoon! The greatest mixer of them ALL!
Well, you've got to stop mixing. 
N-N-N-NO!
I have got to do more mixing.
Oh, no! Who's going to be mixed up now?
'It's all right. He's got his shoes on.'
But look what he's doing now! 
You're supposed to put
your socks on first and THEN your shoes.
That's not the right order at all!
'At least he's got his trousers on properly.'
Oh, no. What's gone wrong now?
He's putting his pants on after his trousers.
SHE SINGS
Wee-ee-ee-ee!
Oh, no!
Five, you've got to do something. 
I know, anything could happen.
Instead of turning the television on first and then watching it,
you might watch it before you turn it on.
How boring would that be?
And instead of getting undressed and then getting into the bath,
you might get in the bath first. How soggy would that be?
And, instead of getting into bed and then falling asleep,
you might fall asleep before getting into bed.
What else is happening out of order? 
I'll find out!
Going to keep an eye on that boy.
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
Why is that boy so happy?
He's doing things out of order.
Usually, you get happy AFTER doing something.
He's doing it before. 
But what could he be happy about?
Maybe he's happy because of scoring a goal.
He didn't get very happy about the goal.
He'd done being happy already. Everything's out of order!
That's weird.
Well, this man's definitely not happy.
He's hurt himself because of something he's going to do.
What can it be? 
I bet it's cos of hitting his thumb with the hammer.
He's not yelling. 
No!
He's done his yelling already. 
That is seriously strange.
Come on, guys. We've got to fix that Spooky Spoon.
OK. Has anyone got any ideas?
If everything is out of order, what can WE do?
Agents! Hope they've got some ideas.
Put things back in order.
But how? 
Find some things that are definitely in order,
things that come one after another.
Can anyone think of things that definitely come one after another?
Oh... 
Hmmm. 
Hmmm.
You do! 
What?
You three definitely come one after the other.
One, Two, Three. 
Oh, yes!
Of course! One, Two, Three!
Get me some Brain Gain!
Oh, yes!
WHIRRING AND BUBBLING
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
One, Two and Three. They are definitely in the right order.
Let's get some ordering Brain Gain going. 
Are you ready, Five? Let's go!
One. 
Two. 
Three.
FIZZLING
Things back in order -- one, two, three.
FIZZLING AND WHIZZING
Hooray! Hooray! 
Well done, Five!
He mustn't hit himself!
Careful!
OK, all sorted. 
Not yet. We've still got to sort out Spooky Spoon.
Hmm. What shall I mix up next?
Hmm.
Shall I make people into grown-ups before they are children?
That would be weird! We have to get rid of her!
We need a one, two, three that will make that spoon go a long way away.
How about like starting a race? 
Yes. One -- on your marks.
Two -- get set. 
Three -- go.
Spooky Spoon, we're going to get rid of you.
Never! I'm going to mix you up.
Let's do it! 
One, two, three!
On your marks... 
Get set... 
Go!
On your marks...
FIZZLING 
What?!
Get set... 
What is going on?
You're GOING away. Go!
Ooooooooooh!
Hooray! 
Come on back now, Five.
All clear for landing. 
WHOOSHING
ALL: One, two, three, four, five!
Well done! 
You sorted her! 
It was Brain Gain -- the power of thinking.
You can't blow bubbles until you've dipped. You put him back in order.
SIX: 
You can't tie your shoes up and THEN put them on.
You need to get things in order to clean your teeth.
ONE: 
The man didn't hit himself. 
And Spooky Spoon got sorted out.
Did the trick! 
ALL: Hooray!
Now we've got things back in order, let's get the skittles sorted. One.
On your marks... 
Two. 
Get set...
Three. 
Go!
Hooray!
And very exciting. 
Can you do things in order -- one, two, three?
What were the first three things you put on when you got dressed?
If you want to tell us or have any problems, call the Numberjacks.
No problem is too small
Oh, dear, Buddy Blocks.
You don't seem very cheerful today.
Buddy Blocks?
I better cheer you up.
Little dance?
That usually cheers you up.
Not very cheerful at all!
Hello, Three!
What are you doing?
Just jumping around, jumping around!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to cheer up my Buddy Blocks.
Actually, they're not very lively today.
You're right.
Are your Buddy Blocks all right today?
Yes, I think so.
Here they come!
They're very lively.
As usual.
Perhaps they could cheer my Buddy Blocks up.
Course they could. They'll liven up your blocks, Three.
Oh. You've got two lots of three.
And they can take your three blocks for a ride.
Wow! 
Whoa!
Wow! 
Whoa!
Wow! 
Whoa-ho!
Whoa. Wow!
Yeah!
Did you enjoy that?
That's cheered them up.
Thank you, Six.
And it's cheered me up, too.
BEEPING 
Let's go!
We've got a call!
Hello, Agent 25 here. Things are going wrong.
But not for long!
Look at this.
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
This boy was sorting out some wheels,
but when he got three wheels,
he got three more.
Three more again! It's a bit strange.
Strange things are what we investigate.
We'll send someone out there. 
Thanks.
OK. Who's going to go?
Well, there were three things, weren't there.
Yes. 
So it ought to be me who goes.
Three, you're a bit of a small number.
I can do it!
I think you can, but with my help.
Oh... all right then. As long as I can go.
Who's going out? 
Six and Three.
ALARM SOUNDS
Good luck, Six! 
Good luck, Three! Checking all clear for launch.
All clear.
Let's go!
ALL: 
Six, five, four,
three, two, one, zero!
ALL: 
Three, two, one, zero!
Looking for a three and a six to land on.
Finding sixes...
and threes.
Looking for two together.
Got a 36! 36!
All right, Three? 
Ah, yes.
Come on, then!
They made it all right.
Better check out what's happening with the boy. 
Let's have a look!
Three more. 
And three more.
How many is that altogether? 
One, two, three...
Four, five, six...
Seven, eight, nine!
Three things turning into nine things. That's strange.
BEEPING 
Another agent calling in!
Agent 34 here. More problems at the cafe.
OK. We better get down there. 
Yeah.
She's got three things too.
It's happening again!
SHE SCREAMS
It's happening outside too.
Oh. Oh!
We've got to sort this out.
Yes, if three things keep getting turned into nine,
anything could happen.
If you had a birthday cake for your third birthday,
suddenly you'd have three lots of three,
and it would be a cake for a nine-year-old.
Or if Goldilocks was having trouble with three bears,
suddenly it would have to be Goldilocks And The Nine Bears!
And having three babies is hard enough already -
what if you had three more, and three more?!
Nine crying babies.
We've got to sort this problem out.
What's making everything go wrong? 
I think I can guess. Look!
The Puzzler!
What do we know about him? 
On screen now.
I bet it's you that's causing trouble.
Yes, your friend Nine is inside my bubble.
You've captured Nine? 
Where is she? Tell us.
I won't tell you until I see
not Six and Three, but Three, Three and Three.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Well, I'm Three.
But I'm Six. How can we be Three, Three and Three?
Sending out an alert.
How can Three and Six become Three, Three and Three?
Anyone who can help us call in now. 
Hurry!
Agent's calling in.
You need three Threes. Three is the first one.
Six has got to change into the other two Threes.
Can he do that?
Yes -- remember his Buddy Blocks.
I'll rerun that on screen.
Yes, that's six buddy blocks turning into two lots of three.
Six can do it!
Six, we've got some good news and some bad news. 
'What is it?'
We know how to solve the puzzle. 
'Good. And the bad news?'
You've got to turn into two threes. 
'What?!' 
You've got to do it.
We'll send you Brain Gain to help.
OK. If it's got to be done,
I, Number Six, will become two Number Threes.
You'll love it.
Getting brain power now! Brain Gain.
Six makes two Threes.
Brain Gain coming.
Six makes two Threes.
Argh!
Wow!
You look different.
We feel different.
Yes, we do.
Oh, hello, Three and Three and Three.
What exactly do you need from me?
Tell us where Nine is?
Or there will be trouble.
Number Nine's here.
NUMBER NINE: 'Help, help!'
Trapped in my bubble.
My friends, she stays in there
till nine small squares make one big square!
Anyone got any information about squares?
A square is this shape. 
All the sides are the same length.
Checking the napkins.
They're square -- all the sides are the same length.
You need to get to the cafe.
We're on our way.
Let's hope they can make them into one big square.
There's nine napkins. 
How can we make them into one big square?
Remember the Buddy Blocks.
I think I've got a picture.
Yes, that's one big square.
Three lots of three, do it with the napkins.
Three rows of three, make that square.
I'll do one row.
I'll do the second row.
I'll do the bottom row.
That's nine small squares.
Three rows of three makes one big square.
Oh, well done, Three and Three and Three.
You've made a square and beaten me.
So, as I promised, Nine goes free.
That's better.
But I'll be back.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Things are going back to normal.
ALL: Yeah!
Come back now, all of you.
One thing to do first.
Definitely.
Two threes make a six.
Two threes make six.
ALL: Yeah!
Come on back now... all of you.
All clear for landing.
One, two, three,
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine!
Well done, everyone!
You can see it all on screen.
The boy had three things,
then nine.
The waitress had trouble,
and the lady. It was all that Puzzler's fault.
And I had a very strange thing to do.
Six becoming two Threes!
We had to make a big square.
You rescued me, thank you.
And everything went back to normal.
Hurray!
Would your Buddy Blocks like another ride, Three? 
Yes, please.
My Buddy Blocks can join in too.
Let's go!
Ooh! 
Whoa! 
Wha-hey!
Wow!
Ooh, two big squares.
I wonder, is there any other number of Buddy Blocks
that could be made into a square? Find out. Or any problems,
contact the Numberjacks.
Beautiful things. I love my beautiful things!
They don't do much though.
What they do is be beautiful.
There, very good. And beautiful.
But not as interesting as, say...
the boing-ball.
You're not supposed to play with that in here.
I can if I'm careful. And I'm always careful.
Ow! 
Careful!
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, Four! 
Sorry! 
Watch out!
BOING-BOING
Ow! 
Sorry. I'll try and catch it.
Whoops! 
Hey!
My beautiful things don't look quite so beautiful now.
If they weren't all over the floor, I wouldn't have trodden on one.
All right then. You can take one beautiful thing away. 
Right.
And it's fair if I take one thing from you. 
I suppose so.
I'll take the boing-ball.
There we are. 
Hang on. You've still got lots of things to play with. 
Yes.
And I've got nothing. It's not fair!
You took one thing away and I took one thing away.
That must be fair. 
But...
Agents calling in!
But you took... I mean... 
No time now. Come on!
We've got a call. 
Come on, Four! 
He's got a lot to think about.
Agent 28 here. Things are going wrong.
Not for long. 
Tell us the problem.
Look what happened to this girl. 
Hold on. I'm putting it on screen.
Nice toys!
Look what happens next!
Oh! The doll's been taken!
Is he going to have something taken?
The truck!
If things are being taken, we'd better get out there. 
Thank you.
It's not very nice when things get taken away.
You know about this sort of thing, Four? 
I certainly do.
Then you'd better get on the mission. 
I'm not sure.
You can do it, Four. Afterwards, I'll give you your boing-ball back.
In that case, I'm sure. I'm going out. 
Hooray!
'Number Four!'
Good luck, Four. 
Thank you. Just get my boing-ball ready. 
OK.
Are you ready? 
I'm not really sure. But why not?
Checking everything is clear...
All clear. Off you go!
Four, three, two, one...
Zero!
Scanning for a four to land on...
Hurry up, Five! 
Found a four.
That's very strange. 
Is the four still there? 
Yeah, the four is.
OK, Four's got somewhere to land.
Oh! 
Watch out, Four. There are strange things going on.
Somebody took the one. 
Lucky the four was still there!
I'm off to find that girl.
We need to know what's going on. 
Look again at what happened.
Why did they take the doll? 
And the truck?
Is something the same about them?
Could be something to do with that one disappearing from the door.
Both times one toy was taken.
Both times it was a toy there was one of. One doll, one truck.
Thanks. That's very useful.
Four, we've got a clue.
Good. 
Whoever is taking things, they are interested in ones.
If there is only ONE thing, that gets taken.
Yes. There's more of it going on, one thing being taken.
I'm on my way.
What's going to go here?
That poor man!
Four, are you there? 
Yes, I'm here.
Things are being taken, but only one thing every time.
And look! I can see who is taking the things.
It's the Number Taker!
Be careful, Four! 
You've got to stop him taking things!
But how? 
We'll think of something.
At least it's one thing at a time.
If he keeps on taking things, what else might he take?
We've only got one sun. What if a giant Number Taker took that?
It would be dark everywhere. We don't want that.
It would be much better if he took one cloud.
We'd still have quite a few clouds left to bring us rain.
If we could get the Number Taker to take one raindrop,
we've got so many of them, we'd hardly notice one being taken.
Yes, that's it.
What is? 
If we can't stop the Number Taker taking things,
let's get him to take things that there are lots of.
It won't matter so much. 
I'll start Brain Gain. 
Four! 
What's the plan?
To stop the Number Taker taking things if there's only one of them.
I'll track him down.
'Getting brain power now! Brain Gain!'
No taking if there's only one. No taking if there's only one.
Not if there's one, not if there's one!
There he is. I'll get the Brain Gain into his mind.
No taking if there's only one. No taking if there's only one!
I think it's working. Looks like he's going for one of the balls.
That's OK. At least there's a few of them.
There's four of them.
He's taken a ball, but there's still three left.
The man can still do his juggling. 
Hooray!
Oh, no! He's taking away another one.
He's taking one thing at a time. 
He's doing it lots of times.
There's only two balls now!
At least he won't take the last one. 
But it's not a great show now!
Poor man!
Where's the Number Taker going now? 
The cafe.
He's after that fruit again!
There's quite a few grapes.
If he takes them one at a time, it's going to take him a long time.
Not if he does it very fast.
That meanie Number Taker!
He's taken nearly everything one by one.
Make him take things there are so many of, it will take him too long!
Any things in the cafe that there are lots and lots of?
Anyone got any ideas?
There are lots of grains of sugar.
Yes! Four, spill the sugar!
Grains of sugar! 
Lots and lots of grains of sugar!
He'll go loopy trying to take the sugar one grain at a time.
It's very hard. 
He doesn't like it.
He's heading for the builders. 
Anything that there's lots of?
Grains of sand. 
Grains of sand.
Grains of sand!
He's really struggling! 
He's going to the park.
Anything that there's lots and lots of?
Blades of grass. 
Blades of grass!
Lots and lots of blades of grass.
There are lots and lots and lots of blades of grass!
He'll never take them all!
That sorted him out. 
Come back now, Four!
All clear for landing! 
One, two, three, four!
Well done, Four! 
That Number Taker is strange. 
It's all on screen.
The Number Taker was only taking one thing.
There was one doll and one tractor.
We had to get him to take things there were a few of.
He took the juggler's balls, but he kept on taking them.
He took the grapes as there were a few of them. 
I'll spill the sugar!
The Number Taker couldn't take lots and lots of grains of sugar.
Or the sand. 
Or all those blades of grass.
Hooray! That sorted him out!
ALL: Yeah! 
And everyone got their things back.
There you go, Four, your boing-ball back, like I promised.
Thank you. Here's your beautiful thing. 
Oh, it's so beautiful!
Oh, no! Help! 
Stop it!
Finally, is there anything on your body that you've only got one of?
And anything you've got lots of?
Have a think and call the Numberjacks.
You're not moving enough, Four!
When there's music, you have to keep moving around! 
I am moving around!
Not like I'm moving around. MUSIC STOPS
Three, the music's stopped.
You're supposed to be a statue now.
Oops.
You're still moving. 
So are you! You're wobbling!
I'm not wobbling, I'm as still as a sta....
I won! 
Not fair.
Let's play again. 
Ah, look, Zero wants to play too.
Come on, Zero, come and join us.
When the music plays, you have to move.
And when the music stops, you stand as still as a statue. OK?
Huh?
Music, start! MUSIC STARTS
Off we go! 
You have to move now, Zero, watch me!
MUSIC STOPS
You didn't stop in time. I won!
No, Zero won, look at him!
Wow, that is a cool freeze.
Well done, Zero, you're really good at this.
Music, start! MUSIC STARTS
You can move now, Zero.
Zero? Are you OK?
He looks like a real statue.
What's the matter with him?
Zero! Can you hear us? 
Say something!
Hm?
Thank goodness, had us worried there.
He wasn't really playing at all.
He was just thinking about... nothing, I suppose.
BEEPING Someone's calling in.
Let's go!
Hm?
Come on, you two. An agent's spotted a problem.
It's Agent 34.
Something's going wrong. 
Not for long!
Some stuff has stopped working.
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
His car's stopped.
His robot's stopped working.
Now this car's got stuck.
Fancy a trip, Six? 
Don't mind if I do.
OK, Six is going. 
Preparing for launch.
Number six. 
SIREN BLARES
Just checking the room's clear.
Clear for launch.
ALL: Six, five, four, four, three, two, one, zero!
Looking for a six to land on.
Found some sixes... got one!
Did the trick.
It's getting stranger. 
On my way.
Look at the blocks.
And the pencils.
And this book's spinning.
Now, that's really weird.
So in this room, we've got a remote control buggy, a wind-up toy,
and a car on the garage ramp. And they're all stuck.
And we've got building blocks, pencils,
and a book that are hopping all over the place!
Agents ringing in! 
Agent 52 here, something's gone wrong in the park.
The roundabout won't spin any more.
It's not much fun here.
On my way.
Oh no, not more problems.
Check out this cafe.
Things on the table are moving about.
His sausages are dancing!
This is a very funny bin!
It's chasing him!
I'm here.
Things are stopping and going all over the park.
That bin's spooky.
It's spooky. 
I just said that.
No, it really is spooky. Look!
Hello, everyone!
I'm back!
ALL: Spooky Spoon!
Ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee hee!
Right, I'm going after her.
If she keeps mixing things up, anything could happen.
Spooky Spoon might make the birds stop flying,
when they're in mid-air!
She might make the dancing cow stop dancing!
And then, she'd just be the cow!
And if you were moving house, Spooky might make the house move with you.
We've got to stop Spooky.
Before she stops anything else! 
Too late, look at this lot!
ENGINE REVS
Mad round here.
I can't find Spooky Spoon anywhere!
There she is!
Oh, I'll have a nice rest on the roundabout.
Ah!
So peaceful.
Since I made it stop, no one else has been near it!
SHE CHUCKLES
We'll have to sort her out later.
First we need to get everything back to normal.
SIX: Brain gain!
Hello, Zero. Got to get this machine going.
Getting brain power now.
Make the moving thing slow down and stop.
Put something on the machine that doesn't move very much.
Think, think! What doesn't move much, Zero?
Hm.
Of course! You!
Right, Zero, see if you can make these things as still as statues.
Like you!
Watch that pointer on the machine.
When it touches zero, the stopping brain gain will fire off.
Ready, Zero? And go!
It's working, look!
Keep doing nothing, Zero!
Brilliant, what's next?
Say no more.
Right, Zero, this is the big one.
Hm.
Hurry up!
We're nearly there, come on, Zero!
ALL: Hooray!
OK, now how do we get the other things moving again?
How about something in the machine that never stops moving?
Yes, me, me, me!
I can do this!
You've got to get the arrow up to three. 
No problem.
Done it.
Now for the street and the park.
She's on a roll, here comes the brain gain, Six.
Yes, and now the roundabout.
Watch out, Spooky's there. 
Here I go!
What? What is going on?
Three, can you make it go any faster?
We might be able to get rid of Spooky if you can.
Getting tired. 
Help her, everyone!
Faster, faster. 
Go faster.
Faster, fast as you can.
Ahhhhhh...
Oh!
ALL: Yeah!
Did I do it? 
You did fine. 
Come back, Six.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One, two, three, four, five, six!
Well done, Six.
You sorted that Spooky Spoon out.
I couldn't have done it without Three, she was fantastic.
And Zero, he helped too.
Yeah.
Let's see it all on screen.
In the house, some toys got stuck.
And some that shouldn't move started moving.
I went to have a look, then other strange things happened.
Everything got stuck. 
It was Spooky Spoon!
And she was mixing up other things too.
She made the sausages dance.
And she made the litter bin chase the poor man. 
Funny!
But we sorted everything out. Zero and Three had to work very hard.
And we sorted Spooky Spoon out too!
So Three, want to play Musical Statues again?
Now that's something you don't see every day.
I'll play with you, come on!
Can you find three things that move by themselves?
And three things that don't move at all?
And any problems, call the Numberjacks!
Where IS it? Must be here somewhere!
Ow! Watch it, Three! 
Sorry!
What's the problem? 
Grrr! I can't FIND it!
Can't find what? 
Three's lost a slidey shape.
I can't find it ANYWHERE! 
Not surprised. They're everywhere!
I'm just PLAYING with them!
Let's help her look.
OK. As long as she stops flinging them my way.
OK! 
What does the slidey shape you've lost look like?
It's a circle shape.
Erm... Is this it? 
No, that's a BLUE circle.
I mean a YELLOW circle.
You know, like the sun.
Let's sort out all the yellow things here
and see if there's a yellow circle anywhere.
OK... Not yellow, not yellow, not yellow...
Yellow!
Oh, not a circle, though.
Not yellow, not yellow...
THREE! 
What?
Look! It's yellow, and it's a circle.
Hurrah! I've found the slidey shape! And I did it all by myself. 
Six and I helped you.
Well. Maybe a tiny bit. BOTH: Three!
ALARM BLEEPS
The alarm!
Race you! 
Someone's spotted a problem.
Agent 88 here. Some things are going wrong.
But not for long! 
Tell us about it.
Things are going missing. I'm putting it on screen. 
What's missing?
Some of these building blocks,
some pens,
and some paint.
So who's going to go?
Me! Me! Oh, PLEASE, me! 
You go, Four. You found Three's yellow circle.
Maybe you can find those things.
Mm. I'm not sure...
I am. I'll go! 
Need you here, Three. 
Oh!
Need you to work out what's going wrong there. You're good at that.
Yes, I am, aren't I?
Let's go, Four!
Number Four!
SIREN WAILS
Checking it's all clear for launching.
The goldfish are watching.
Don't worry about them. They forget things very quickly.
All clear, then!
ALL: Four. Three.
ALL: Two. One. Zero!
LAUNCHER BLASTS
Finding a four to land on...
Found some fours...
Got a four!
Clear to land.
Phew! Made it!
Everything seems OK at the moment.
Keep your eyes open, Four.
Whoah!
Why are all these things going missing? 
Is there something the same about them all? 
I know, I know! They're all yellow things! 
You're right, Three! Well done! 
I'm clever, aren't I?
Another call!
Strange things are going on by the river.
On my way!
Well, I think someone's up to no good.
And I think I know who that someone is.
EVIL GIGGLING
Spooky Spoon's here!
Yellow! Ooh! That's got to go!
You have to find a way to stop her, Four.
Here's the data on her. On screen!
Uh-oh! 
One, two, three!
Spooky Spo-o-on! 
Right. I'd better try and find out where she's gone now.
Look what's happening in the sports hall.
And outside in the park! 
Red things! Spooky's started taking red things!
But why?
I'll tell you why.
I am tired of all these lovely colours in the world
because they make me look BORING!
Boo! What a meanie!
Ha, ha, ha! Just try and stop me!
SHE CACKLES WITH LAUGHTER
Here I am. No sign of Spooky, though.
You just missed her! 
She's taking red things now!
The agents are back!
Calling Numberjacks! We're losing blues.
The blue shirts have gone too.
They can't play any more. No-one knows which team they're on.
Oh, no! If she goes on taking colours from the world,
just think what might happen!
No more beautiful red roses!
No more green grass or leaves.
No more blue sky!
And no more bright yellow sun.
It'll be a very dull world!
I've just thought... If Spooky's taking blue things...
.. what about ME?!
Yes! It's time to take you-oo, Mr Blue!
SHE LAUGHS
She's taken Four! She's taken Four!
OK. We mustn't panic.
She's gone too far this time!
Scanning the park for him now.
I hope he's OK.
I can't see him!
Agents ringing in to help.
You need to put blue back into the world.
And that will get Four back.
We'll need Brain Gain.
Getting Brain Power now! Brain Gain!
Think blue, everyone!
Blue, like the sky. -- Blue, like the sea on a sunny day. 
Here it comes!
There he is!
But he looks funny.
We need something extra-blue, like Four, in the machine.
I know! Four's body blocks. I'll get one. 
Brilliant, Three!
Ooh... Where am I?
Thanks, Three. Now, everybody.
Think blue again! Blue like Number Four!
Blue like Number Four!
Blue like Number Four!
BOTH: Blue like Number Four.
Here comes the Brain Gain!
ALL: Hurray!
Am I back?
Yes. And you've got to get the blue things back.
OK.
Now where else do we need some blue?
Sorted!
Are you OK?
I think so. 
Good.
We need you to help get the other colours back.
And sort out Spooky Spoon.
If she wants colours, send her lots of colours.
Send them all together.
Brilliant! Three...
Bring all the body blocks over to the Brain Gain machine.
What's going on here?
Hurry up! I don't want to be Spooky Spooned again!
Now! Imagine as many colours as you can!
Yellow. Red.
Blue. -- Orange.
Green. -- Purple.
PINK! 
That's it! Here comes the Brain Gain!
Oh! So many lovely colours!
Which one suits me best?
Oh, pink!
Orange...
Oh, purple!
Oh, I look lovely in ALL of them!
Oh, this one. No, that one!
I can't decide...
Red? Yellow? Rellow? Blellow? Rellow?
Oh, I dunno!
SHE SCREAMS
Bye-bye, Spooky!
Well done, Four. And are the missing yellows and reds back?
Scanning now...
All the yellow things are back.
And all the red things are back.
Great! So now we can have Four back!
Come home, Four.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One. Two. Three. Four!
Phew! Am I glad to be home!
Well done, Four! 
You were very brave!
We really sorted Spooky Spoon out this time.
It was tough going, though. On the screen now!
Lots of things were going missing.
And they were all yellow!
I went out...
Spooky was taking yellow things.
Then she took red things.
And the blues.
And then she took me!
Four's body block helped rescue him.
Then we sorted Spooky.
She couldn't make up her mind what colour to be!
We got all the colours back into the world.
Another good job done!
Look, you two! I've put all of the slidey shapes into groups.
Red ones here,
yellow ones here,
blue ones here.
Now it's much easier to see where everything is.
Well done, Three. Very tidy!
Just one thing...
There's a blue slidey shape here with all the yellow ones.
Oops! Better start again.
STOP! No need to mess them up again.
There. All sorted.
Thanks, Four.
Can YOU find three things?
A yellow thing, a red thing and a blue thing?
Check your colours. And call the Numberjacks.
I think, of all my beautiful things, YOU are the most beautiful.
Hi, Three. What have you got there?
One of my beautiful things.
Beautiful. 
It's my best one.
Best. 
And, look,
it can turn into two beautiful things
then fit back together again.
It's great, Three. 
Great.
I know. And I love it.
I want it.
Oh-oh!
I want it!
You can have this.
No, this.
Two! Bring it back. It's mine.
No, mine.
Oh, no!
There you go, Three. 
Thanks.
Grr! 
Hey, Two, let's go and see Seven.
Oh. 
We could do some painting with her.
Me paint.
Yes, you like painting, don't you?
It's all right, you're safe now.
WHIRRING Oh, someone's got a problem.
I'd better hide you.
You'll be all right there till I come back.
Three! Where are you? 
Coming!
Agent 14 here. Something's wrong.
But not for long. 
What's up?
Look at this picture.
FOUR: 
I'm putting it on screen.
Did SHE paint it like that?
No, it was a whole face when she painted it.
But now part of it's gone missing. How odd!
And look at the fruit.
That orange has been cut down the middle.
But where's the other part of it?
And this too.
What's wrong here, then?
Look at that lunch box.
We'll send someone right away. 
OK. Thanks.
I'd love to know what happened to those missing pieces. 
You go, Four.
Maybe you can solve the mystery. 
Oh, no, I'm not sure if I can.
Of course you can! 
Oh!
Number Four.
SIREN WAILS
Checking it's all clear for launching.
All clear. Nobody about.
Ready, Four.
Four! Three!
Two! One! Zero!
Finding a four to land on.
Got some fours.
Found a four.
Phew! I'm glad that bit's over.
Bits of the sandwiches are disappearing.
We've got another call.
Agent 47 here. Something strange in the cafe.
On screen now.
That's a funny tablecloth.
Part of it's been taken away. 
Like all the other things we've seen.
And it's a different shape now.
I'll see what I can find out.
Part of her pizza just went missing.
What's going on today?
Have you noticed? When bits of these things go missing,
the things change shape. 
She's right!
Oh! If things are changing shape, you know who might be changing them.
Psst!
(The Shape Japer's here.)
I was afraid she might be.
(I'm outside the sports centre.
(If you look up there above the door, you can just see her.)
How did you find her?
EVIL LAUGHTER
Not difficult with THAT laugh.
Let's see what we know about her.
We know the Shape Japer loves to change shapes.
But why has she been taking parts of things away?
I wonder what she'll get up to next.
You've got to try and stop her, Four.
But how?
EVIL LAUGHTER
I'm glad SHE'S happy.
It's Agent 96 here. There's trouble with the table tennis. 
On my way.
AGENT 96: They've lost part of their ball.
Some of their net's gone too.
And he's lost half his trousers.
What did you just say, Four?
That man's lost half his trousers.
Half his trousers?!
And half a ball and half of the net?
So that's what the Shape Japer's doing. 
What? 
What?
She's taking away a half of everything.
Oh, dear. If the Shape Japer keeps on taking halves of things,
anything could happen.
People would be left with only half of their favourite storybooks.
And they wouldn't be very comfy if their beds were half beds.
Oh!
And what about the Dancing Cow?
Half the Dancing Cow would only have two legs
and she'd fall over.
We've got to stop the Shape Japer's halving trick.
And how can we get all these half things back to whole things?
Agents ringing in to help.
We've still got one half of all these things.
They need two halves to make them whole.
Can you do it with Brain Gain?
But what can we use to make two halves of everything? 
I know!
Number Two! I'll fetch him.
I'll get the machine going.
Go on, Two, have a good jump around.
Me jump.
ALL: Two, Two, Two!
Two halves make a whole.
Two halves make a whole.
Here comes the Brain Gain, Four.
Everyone together!
ALL: Two halves make a whole!
Two halves make a whole!
BOTH: Two halves make a whole.
Two halves make a whole. Whee-ee!
ALL: Hooray!
We did it.
Everything's back to normal. Well done, Four. 
Just one thing...
where's the Shape Japer?
There's an emergency in the party room.
On my way.
The Shape Japer's spoiling the party.
EVIL LAUGHTER
No! Not the cake!
EVIL LAUGHTER
She's gone too far this time.
I'm going to find her and I'm going to fix her.
He's really cross, isn't he? 
I hope he doesn't do anything silly.
(Put the Brain Gain machine into reverse.)
That's done. What's your plan, Four?
(She's over there. See?
(We're going to make a whole thing into two halves.)
Brilliant!
Jump, Two.
Jump, jump, jump.
ALL: One whole makes two halves.
Louder. Agents, too.
BOTH: One whole makes two halves.
Here it comes.
SHAPE JAPER MOANS
ALL: Hooray!
Everything back to normal.
Come back now, Four.
You bet!
All clear for landing.
One! Two!
Three! Four!
It's good to be back.
Nice work, Four. You were great.
Let's see it all on screen.
Parts of things were going missing in the house. 
I went to look.
Then things went missing in the cafe and the sports centre.
The Shape Japer was taking halves of things and changing their shape.
We sent Brain Gain to make the half things back into whole things.
Two halves make a whole. 
Then the Shape Japer spoiled the party.
You were really cross, Four.
So we split the Shape Japer into two halves. She didn't like that.
Bye, Shape Japer. 
And a happy ending at the party.
Here I am, my beautiful thing.
Have you missed me?
I want it.
Oh, no! 
Please me have it?
Well... you were very good on the Brain Gain machine, so...
.. you can have half and I'll have half,
just for a little while. 
Beautiful.
It is, isn't it? 
That's really kind of you, Three.
OK, out there, you need to know about halves.
Can you fold a piece of paper exactly in half? It's not easy,
so any problems, call the Numberjacks.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, TEN!
Coming, ready or not!
I said I'm coming!
I think I can safely say I've found you.
What do you mean "found me"?
We're playing hide and seek.
Are we? I thought we were playing statues.
Well, Zero and One knew what the game was
cos they're definitely hiding
so you're found. 
All right then, you hide.
Right, you try and find me. 
I'm going to start counting.
One...
two...
three, four...
.. five, six...
Shall I hide here?
.. seven, eight...
Or here?
.. nine, ten!
I'll hide here.
Coming, ready or not!
Yes, I'll hide here.
Oh yes, this is a good place!
He'll never find me here!
Great, lovely, just the job!
Three?
I can see you. You're found.
Oh, that was quick!
That's cos I could hear you. 
Oh, I forgot about that.
We still haven't found Zero and One though.
I'll find them. My go again.
Don't look! 
Course not.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... TEN!
Hang on!
I can see you, Four. Found you, found you!
Yes, but you didn't count properly up to ten that time.
So? 
You missed out nine.
It's eight, nine, ten!
We're not very good at this game, are we?
No. Zero and One are.
I can't find them anywhere. 
BLEEPING
We'll have to find them later. Come on.
We've got a call!
Hello, Agent 25 here. Things are going wrong.
But not for long.
There's a problem with grumpy mums.
Hold on. I'm putting it onscreen.
SHE TELLS HIM OFF
Everyone has that problem sometimes.
Yes. Your mum's bound to be grumpy now and again.
He can handle one grumpy mum, but he's got loads of 'em.
That DOES look like a problem!
OK. Who's going out there?
I'm up for it.
OK, Five, it's you this time. 
Good luck!
OK, get ready for launching.
KLAXON
Good luck, Five!
Ready for launch. Checking the room's empty.
All clear.
OK, let's go.
ALL: Five, four, three, two, one,
ZERO!
Looking for a five to land on.
Finding the five...
Found a five!
Everything all right, Five? 
Everything's fine.
Go and help that boy!
There he is!
And all his grumpy mums!
We'd better find out how many mums there are.
I think there are about... ten.
We should know exactly how many. Let's count them!
One, two, three,
four, five...
.. six, seven, eight, nine, TEN!
Well done, Three.
There are ten mums, Five.
Agent 52 here. We've got more problems.
What's been going wrong, Agent 52? 
Have a look.
Aaaah!
Can anyone see what's going on?
BLEEPING 
Agents calling in.
Agent 61 here.
One thing keeps on turning into lots of things.
Count them. Is it the same number every time?
I've got the pictures on screen.
There's one, two, three,
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten!
AND five apples.
And five more.
That's ten!
And five mops...
and five mops.
That's ten!
OK. We know we've got ten of everything but why?
Hang on, I just heard something. Listen.
Can't find me!
That's Number One, somewhere out here.
No wonder we couldn't find her when we played hide and seek.
Everyone looking for Number One! 
Keep your eyes open.
I bet I'll find her.
There she is!
You'll have to get after her, Five.
But wait, listen. 
Can't find me.
Zero's out there too! 
Bet I'll find Zero first.
Is that Zero?
Ooh!
Five, you have to get One AND Zero. 
But our problem's about ten things.
I've got a Number Ten on screen.
ALL: Hmm.
Better get after them anyway, they're headed out to the park. 
OK.
There's One AND there's Zero.
Zero's going up to One.
PING!
I think we've got ten things again.
I've got it on screen! 
One and Zero get together...
and there's the Number Ten!
I've got to stop One and Zero getting together and making Ten,
or anything could happen.
Instead of a monster with one head,
it would have ten heads!
Or there might be ten dancing cows.
COWS MOO
But if one sun was turned into ten suns,
it would be far too hot and everything would die.
There they are again!
They're getting together.
We've got to keep One and Zero away from each other.
Let's send some Brain Gain.
One and Zero -- keep them away from each other.
Keep One and Zero away from each other. 
Keep them away!
Bah!
Bah!
ALL TALK
OK. I THINK we've got it all sorted.
Phew!
You'd better get them and bring them back. 
I've spotted them again.
Now what are they up to?
That's OK. There should be ten green bottles standing on the wall.
I think they're moving apart this time.
What's going to happen to the bottles if they do? 
Agents calling in.
If One's left without Zero,
there won't be ten bottles any more.
There'll be one green bottle standing on the wall.
Hmm...
Zero's going!
Where will One and Zero go next?
This could be trouble. 
What's the matter, Five?
They're going to play five-a-side football. 
So?
Don't you see?
Five...
and five...
make ten! And one and Zero might change ten kids into one.
There they are!
If they move apart, ten will turn into one
and most of the children will disappear!
They're going to move apart!
Keep One and Zero together! 
Keep One and Zero together.
Keep together!
More Brain Gain!
Keep together!
CHILDREN CHEER
They're tired out!
We did it! 
Come back, Five, and bring One and Zero with you.
ALL: Zero, One, Two, Three, Four, Five!
Well done, Five. 
And what you did was very naughty, One and Zero.
I don't think they really knew what they were doing.
Well, they can see it on screen.
That boy had a LOT of grumpy mums! 
Ten of them!
All those mops! 
And apples.
And bowling pins.
We spotted One and Zero.
One and Zero together make Ten... and lots of trouble!
Like ten footballs.
We got One and Zero apart and everything was fine
but then they turned things that SHOULD be ten into one!
We HAD to stop them. 
And we did!
Right, let's finish off this game of hide and seek.
One and Zero are very good at hiding.
One minute you see the numbers One and Zero...
then you see the Number Ten!
Amazing! Can you count ten things somewhere on your body?
Then can you count ten things elsewhere on your body? Let us know.
Or, any problems, call the Numberjacks!
Are you ready, Five?
Yeah! 
This is going to be a tricky jump. 
We'll be fine. 
OK.
One... 
Two...
It's me! 
Whoa!
Oh. Did I surprise you?
We were just about to do a very tricky jump.
I could do it. 
Watch.
One, two, three!
Whooo! 
Wahey! 
Whooo!
Wow! I couldn't do that!
It takes a lot of practice. 
OK.
That's all right. I'll go and find Four. 
See you later!
Four will be really glad to see me.
Now, the important thing is not to head the ball too hard...
It's me! 
Oooh!
Oh no! Look what you did, Three!
Oooh! 
I didn't know what you were doing!
It was going well till you got here! 
I'm sorry!
No-one wants me today.
Come on, quick!
Agent!
Hello, Agent 25 here. Things are going wrong!
But not for long! 
This girl's got a problem.
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
It's just got a wheel missing. 
But why is there a wheel missing?
It just went.
OK. We're sending someone out.
Thanks.
Well, I think I should go. 
Why?
There should have been four wheels.
It's a problem about four, so I should sort it.
But there were three wheels, so I should go.
Four! 
Three!
Well, maybe... 
You should both go!
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
You look after Three, now.
Of course.
Come on! Get ready for launching!
Shall I go first? 
Go for it!
Four and Three!
Good luck!
Ready for launch! Checking the room's empty...
All clear. Let's go!
Four! Three! Two! One! Zero!
We've... got a problem.
What's gone wrong?
The launcher's broken. Three's gone without me!
Just my luck. Hope Three's all right.
Closing the doors!
Three's on her own! 
Finding her a three to land on.
Finding threes...
Got a three!
All right, Three?
Yes. Where's Four?
We had a problem with the launcher. You're on your own!
Oh. 
Any luck with the launcher, Four?
It's going to be a long job, Six.
You're going to have to handle this alone, Three.
I... I can do it. I'll check the car. 
Yes. One, two, three wheels. 
That's why it's not working properly.
I'm sure a car could work somehow with three wheels.
Another Agent calling in!
Agent 34 here. More problems in the cafe.
She's folding the napkins!
Is that the problem?
No, this is. Look.
One of the table legs has disappeared!
One, two... three legs only!
Hope nothing else goes!
Oh no! Another leg gone!
What's going wrong with all these things? Is there a link?
Agent 88 here.
There are three wheels on the car instead of four, and it don't work.
The table and chair have got three legs. 
Three doesn't work.
Of course three works! Three is a very good number.
It's not working as well as four at the moment.
Ha ha ha! 
The Shape Japer!
What do we know about the Shape Japer? 
Checking out the data.
Looks like the Shape Japer's back. 
But why is the Shape Japer interested in numbers today?
Ha ha ha!
What's she laughing at?
Three! Ha ha ha! 
What? Me?
She's laughing at everything with three. 
That's not fair.
Maybe the Shape Japer likes a different number.
But what number? And why?
It's no good. I still can't fix the launcher.
The Shape Japer is a square, so she likes Number Four. 
But why? 
Cos a square has got four corners, and four sides.
Four! Ha ha ha ha!
After her, Three!
She thinks four is best! 
Well, she has a point.
I'll find some things where three does work very well.
CHEERING
Sounds interesting. I'll check it out.
And I'll get back to fixing the launcher.
Got to find some threes!
We'll look! 
Check the faces. Anything there that comes in threes?
Eyes... one, two. No good.
Lots of twos around. Two legs, two arms...
We can see lots of fours, too.
Four wheels on the buggy...
Four legs on the table. 
Four! Ha ha ha ha ha!
I WILL find things with three in!
We're all looking!
Look! A buggy with three wheels!
Yes!
Look! A three-legged stool!
Oh, yes! 
What's happening over there?
It's the three-legged race. Sort of three legs.
Yes, yes, yes!
We need more threes! Any shapes with three corners and three sides?
Look at the sandwiches! They're triangles, with three sides!
Four! Ha ha ha ha! 
We need more triangles to beat the Shape Japer!
I can't see any more triangles.
Then I'll have to make some. I bet I can. 
How?
Get some straws to make a shape with three sides.
I'll power up the Brain Gain machine!
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain! 
Three straws together. Make a triangle!
Three fingers together make a triangle.
Make a triangle!
Three straws make a triangle!
Yes! Three corners and three sides!
Ha!
We've got her worried, but we need a bigger triangle!
I'll find some things to make a bigger triangle.
I wonder...
Yes, why not? Three children to make a triangle!
Three children to make a triangle!
Three corners! And three sides!
Yes. Well done, Three.
See, Shape Japer? I found lots of things with three in them.
And make triangles! 
Nah!
We've got her worried.
Square! Ha ha! Ha ha!
She's still going on about four sides!
If we could turn that square rug into a triangle, that would show her.
I'm sure I've seen a square being turned into a triangle...
When? Try and remember!
When did we see a square being folded into a triangle?
Back in the cafe. The waitress folding the napkins.
I'll put it on screen.
Yes! Look at that! 
I'll do that with the picnic rug.
We'll help.
Square into triangle! Square into triangle!
Square into triangle!
Yargh!
Yes! Triangle! Three corners, and three sides!
Now, fold that Shape Japer, too! Square into triangle!
She won't like it. Square into triangle!
Aaaaagh!
Aaaaagh!
I've fixed the machinery. 
Great. Come back now, Number Three.
Checking the room's clear... it's clear!
One, two, three!
Well done, Three!
That was a bit tricky! 
Got it all on screen for you to see.
The girl's car should have had four wheels.
The table needed four legs.
That Shape Japer! Saying things with three don't work!
Just cos she was square today, she liked four!
But we found lots of things with three. 
And we made triangles, too!
Three corners, and three sides! 
Yeah!
And we turned a square into a triangle!
And got rid of the Shape Japer.
And everything back to normal. 
Hurray!
So, I'm in the middle. 
Yes.
For this game, you need three people to play. To you...
Oooh! 
I'll get it, I'll get it!
What's the matter? 
I was just wondering.
If we'd folded a corner of that rug again, what shape would it have made?
Find out, and call the Numberjacks!
It's a bit squashy here.
You could budge up a bit. 
OK. 
Not that way.
Budge up the other way. Away from me.
Well, you should've said what you meant! 
Please, budge up the other way. 
OK!
Is that it? 
What?!
You only budged up a tiny bit.
You didn't say how big a budge you wanted!
Well, I... 
You've got to say what you mean! 
I'll show you what I mean.
I mean budging up this much!
OK, I see how much you mean now. 
Well, well... aren't you going to budge up?
Why? You've already done the budging. 
Yeah, but...
No point me budging up now, is there?
I suppose not.
But if you really want me to... 
I will budge up. 
Thank you.
ALARM SOUNDS Oh, well, next time. 
Oh! 
Come on!
We've got a call. 
Who is it?
Agent 34 here, we've got something going wrong.
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
She needs a bigger brush than that! 
That's what she thought and this is what she got.
It's definitely a bigger brush.
But it's much too big, she'll have even more trouble now.
What's she doing?
That's very clever.
But she's not going to brush her hair properly like that.
And there's another problem. 
This boy was drawing and he ran out of paper.
So he wished he had a bigger bit. And now it's too big.
There's something strange going on.
So will you send someone out? 
Yes, how about you, Four? Ready to go on a mission?
I suppose so, why not?
Four is on his way. 
Thanks.
Number Four!
ALARMS BLARE
Checking everything's clear. All clear. No, wait!
Wait there, Four.
Ready when you are.
OK, all clear now.
Stand by, Four.
Off you go!
Four-three-two-one-zero!
Scanning for a four to land on.
Found a four!
Ooh! 
Good luck, Four. 
Keep your eyes open.
I will. I'll go and help that girl and boy.
At least that piece of paper will be recycled.
Her friend's helping.
They're doing their best but it's not great.
Things aren't right out there.
Right. Let's sort this out. 
We need to know why things went wrong.
Agent 47 here. I bet the girl wished for a bigger brush.
She didn't say how much bigger she wanted it.
The boy must've wished for a bigger piece of paper.
He didn't say how much bigger.
I bet they're right.
That girl and boy didn't say clearly what they wanted.
Got another call coming in.
The man who does the cleaning, he's in trouble with his brush now.
Putting it on screen.
That brush was too big to sweep into his pan.
Did he want a different brush?
Yes. He wished he had a smaller brush. 
He wasn't very clear how small he wanted it.
He's going to be sweeping for AGES with that brush.
He's unlucky he got such wrong brushes.
I don't think they were unlucky.
I think something made them have a problem.
What did? 
The Problem Blob, look!
Yeuch! 
Putting the data on screen.
Uh-oh
Look! The cleaner's got slime on him. That's why things are going wrong.
The girl and boy must have been slimed too.
He's getting very hot. All that sweeping with a tiny brush.
I bet he's wishing he had something to wipe himself with.
Oh, no, what size will it be?
Bigger than he expected. 
A lot bigger than he expected!
All because he didn't say what size he wanted.
You've got to say what you want,
or the Problem Blob will make sure it's not right!
More problems! 
At the cafe. 
The lady's just asked for a few beans with her meal.
Look! She's been slimed. 
So something will go wrong!
She asked for a few beans so she'll get...
Three beans! That's not very many. 
If you're not clear what you want,
the Problem Blob makes you end up with something silly.
She's asked for more beans. 
Did she make it clear how many more beans she wanted? 
No.
Oh, dear.
Uh-oh!
If you don't make it clear what you want, that's when things go wrong.
Thanks to the Problem Blob.
If you're cold in bed and you wanted a blanket.
You might just get a doll's blanket that was far too small.
Or someone might wish for a bike and they'd get one that was far too big.
Or someone might wish for some ice cream.
And the Problem Blob would make sure they got far, far, far, too much!
You've got to be clear in what you say.
We've got to sort this Problem Blob out.
There are problems at a picnic. 
I'm on my way.
Be careful what you say!
I bet the Blob is there somewhere. 
There he is! 
BLOB BLOB BLOB
He'll make things go wrong again.
The sandwiches are different sizes.
That's a very small one.
That's a very big one.
And that's a very long sandwich!
These sandwiches need sorting out. 
How can they make all the sandwiches the right size?
Make them all about the same size.
Yes, make them all the size of your hand.
Brilliant! We'll send Brain Gain to sort it out.
I'll get the Brain Gain going. 
Getting brain power now! Brain Gain!
All sandwiches got to be the size of a hand.
BOTH: The size of a hand.
ZZAPP!
ZZAPP!
ZZAPP!
ZZAPP!
ZZAPP! 
Yes! Sandwiches the size of a hand!
The sandwiches are going well. 
The Blob won't like that.
How are they going to share the drink out fairly?
If they all have one cupful, it should be all right. Shouldn't it? 
What could go wrong?
Look!
That's a cupful, but it's not very much.
And there's another cupful. That's not very fair.
But it is very heavy.
The Problem Blob liked that.
HO-HEE HO-HEE HO!
The cups have got to be the same size too.
Make the cups about the same size as your hands. 
Like this.
Sending Brain Gain. Make the cups the size of your hands. 
The size of your hands.
ZZAPP! ZZAPP!
Cups are all the size of hands. The picnic will be good.
Not if we don't get rid of the Problem Blob.
Send the Problem Blob away! Send him away!
Away, away!
ZZAPP!
ZZAPP!
Ooooh... 
THE BLOB MUMBLES
Oh, no, we didn't say how far away!
Send him so far away, we can't even see it! 
So far we can't even see it.
ZZAPP! ZZAPP!
Oooh!
Yes! 
Done it! Come back now, Four.
Here I come.
All clear for landing.
One-two-three-four!
Well done, Four. 
We told our Problem Blob EXACTLY where to go.
We got it all on screen.
The girl wanted a bigger brush -- but not that big! 
And the paper was much too big.
The cleaner needed a brush to match his pan.
And he didn't need a giant handkerchief.
It was all the Problem Blob's fault.
He was making the picnic go wrong too!
All the sandwiches were the wrong size.
Till we made them the size of a hand. And we sent the Problem Blob away -
so far we couldn't see him.
Everything back to normal.
You must be tired, Four, after all that rushing about.
Do you want to sit down?
I do. 
Well, we'll budge up. 
To make exactly enough room for you.
Thank you.
Very good.
One last thing.
Can you find anything in your house that's about the size of your hand?
Find out and call the Numberjacks.
Ha ha! Hmmm, that's good.
I'm not in the mood for reading.
I'm not in the mood for anything much. Except making noises.
Meep meep meep! Doo doo doo!
Meeble, meeble, doodle do!
Meeble, doodle do!
Meeble, meeble, doodle, doodle, meeble, doodle do! 
Ahem!
Is it a good book? 
I expect so.
It's a bit hard to tell at the moment.
Oh. I know! I could do some jumping!
Joop, joop, joop-joop.
Joop, joop, joop, joop-joop.
You COULD go to the gym, if you want to jump.
No. I like it here, with you. 
Oh, good(!)
Oh, look! Here's One. 
Lovely(!)
Hey, One! We're making noises, and jumping. 
Not ALL of us are.
Joop-a-joop! Joop-a-joop-joop!
Gleep!
Flub! 
That's not very good!
I think it is! She's making just one noise at a time.
Flub! 
And one little jump.
I could do just one jump. Joop!
I bet you couldn't make just one noise.
I could, I could! 
Gloop. 
I can do that!
Dooble ooble ooble dooble ooble dooble do!
That's not one noise! 
Dip dip dip dip dip dip dip!
I think I'll finish this later.
No time for it now, come on!
We've got a call coming in!
Agent 55 here! 
What's up?
Things are going wrong! 
But not for long!
It's a bit worrying. 
What is it?
This girl had lots of things.
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
She's still got a lot of things.
Yes, but look what she had before. 
Something strange going on.
We'd better send someone out. 
Thank you!
OK, who's going? 
I've had a good rest, I'm ready for action.
OK, Six is going. 
Get ready for launching!
Number Six!
Good luck, Six! 
Ready for launch. Checking the room's empty.
It's all clear. 
Let's go!
Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Zero!
Looking for a six to land on...
Got a six!
Right, I'm ready for action.
Why have some toys been taken, and some been left?
All agents out there, any ideas?
Agent 68 here. There's only one of each toy.
Something has taken all the other toys, and left only one of each.
Six! There's just one of every toy!
We must watch out for things there are more than one of.
They'll be taken!
Agent 94 here. I think there's going to be trouble for the gardener.
OK, I'm on my way. 
I've put it on the screen.
He's all ready to sow some seeds.
He's getting the soil ready with his fork.
Nice and flat.
Lots of seeds to sow.
That's all right. What's the problem?
I think I can see the problem. 
What? 
Look!
Aaagh! The Numbertaker! 
Putting the data on screen.
What's he going to take? 
Things there are more than one of.
The fork should be all right, there's only one of that.
And there's only one rake.
Oh, no! There are lots of seeds!
The Numbertaker will be after them!
He's getting some more seeds!
Why is he grabbing the fork? There's only one of them!
Agents, what's going on?
There's only one fork, but it has three prongs.
The Numbertaker is taking any number more than one.
What's he done?
There's only one prong left! 
That's not going to be much good.
Oh, no! The prongs of the rake!
That's not going to be much good!
He's not going to be happy!
Surely nothing else can go wrong.
Oh, no. The watering can!
The Numbertaker has taken all the other holes, and only left one!
That Numbertaker! Where's he gone?
Off to cause more trouble. 
Taking things, leaving one.
He's even taken one of the gardener's boots!
I'd better get after the Numbertaker.
How can we stop him taking things?
He mustn't see anything, if there's more than one of them.
I've spotted the Numbertaker!
He's looking for things, so he can grab them!
OK, the plan is to make sure he doesn't see anything
with a number more than one in.
Right. 
We've got to spot things before he does,
and get them out of his sight.
OK, good plan. Everyone look closely.
Mustn't let anything past that has more than one.
Check out the trolley. Is it in danger?
Yes! It's got one, two, three, four wheels.
Scare the lady away. 
I guess I've got to.
Boo! 
Aaagh! Aaagh!
I don't like scaring people. 
It's for their own good.
Better than having your wheels grabbed.
I'll see if there are any more things.
The gardener! He doesn't want any more trouble!
Is his wheelbarrow OK?
Yes! It's got one wheel.
If he's after wheels, the Numbertaker won't be interested.
Great! 
We've got to get rid of the Numbertaker,
or he'll keep grabbing things that have more than one.
If you had some cereal,
the Numbertaker would grab everything except one bit of cereal!
If you had a plant in a pot, it would only have one leaf...
.. and one petal!
Or if there were lots of people together,
the Numbertaker would make it only one person,
and she'd be very lonely.
We've got to stop that Numbertaker.
You'll have to be quick, he's coming!
Oh, no! He'll be after you, Six!
Oh, yes! 
Because you're a number more than one.
What number isn't the Numbertaker grabbing? 
One!
He won't grab One! You've got to get One out here!
OK. Time for an emergency launch! 
I'll get her ready!
Do you think One will be all right? 
She'll have to be!
Good luck, One. 
Oooh.
Ready for launch. Checking the room's empty...
All clear!
It's going to be a very short countdown. Ready?
One! Zero!
One is on her way. 
Found her a one to land on.
Come on, One. We need you!
She can get close, without being grabbed.
It's up to you, One. You're the only number that can save us.
What can poor little One do against a great big Numbertaker?
Wait a minute... she doesn't have to be little One. She can be big One.
Yes! We need Brain Gain to make her bigger.
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
Think big! Think one elephant!
Think big! One big building! 
Think big! One big plane!
Sending Brain Gain now!
Think big! Think big One!
Think big, big, big!
Think scarily big!
THEY ALL CHEER
Number One did the trick!
Come on back, Six.
All clear.
One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six!
Well done, One! 
Oooh. 
Come and see what you look like on screen.
She only had one of each toy,
but she's all right now the Numbertaker's gone.
And the gardener had a bad time, but he's OK now.
I had to scare away the lady with the trolley,
so the Numbertaker wouldn't get her,
cos she had four wheels on the trolley.
And the gardener had one wheel, which was OK.
But once One arrived, and got bigger,
that was the end of the Numbertaker.
Ahhh. 
You know you wanted me just to make one noise? 
Yes...
Well... I will make just one noise.
But it's going to be a big one.
YAY!
One last thing. Check your home.
What things have you got just one of?
Check it out, and call the Numberjacks!
Today, I want to practise a game of Estimate!
And... 
Wow! I want to play! I want to play!
OK, I'll show you how to play.
It's called Estimate... 
I can do that!
Know what "estimate" means? 
No.
It's like guessing and you've got to look and think.
OK...
I wait to see how many things there are, then...
.. if I think it's near my number,
estimate six!
Yeah, I think there are about six dots.
Hang on, hang on.
There's one, two, three, four, five dots there! Not six!
I didn't say it was exactly my number, I said estimate six.
Could be six or a bit more or a bit less.
Clever! 
Do you want a go? 
Oh, yes.
OK, I've got it.
Could be the same as my number or a bit more or a bit less.
Ready, go!
Three, it doesn't have to be exactly your number,
it could be nearly your number. 
Oh, yeah!
Estimate three!
One, two, three, four.
Which is only a little bit more than three.
Well done. 
Yes!
Estimate! Estimate!
Do you want to go together? 
Yes!
BEEPING Oh! I want to play Estimate!
Later, we've got work to do, come on.
There's a call coming in.
Agent 28 here. Things are going wrong.
But not for long!
This boy is having problems. 
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
He needs four pieces to finish his construction.
He can't work out which pile has about the right number.
Because he's not deciding, the pieces do strange things.
Weird! 
He'll never build that construction
if they keep doing that. We'll send someone straightaway.
Thank you. 
I'll go, 6.
Get ready for launching.
Number 5!
Good luck, 5!
Checking the room...
Hang on -- someone there.
Oh, let me make the doorbell ring. 
Go on, then.
DOORBELL RINGS
There won't be anybody at the door. 
Room clear.
I love doing that! 
Let's go!
5...4...3...
2...1... zero!
Looking for a 5 to land on.
There's a 5.
OK, 5? 
I'm fine.
That's good. I think we've got more problems.
Strange things are happening to the builder.
She knows she needs six nails
but she can't work out which pile has got about the right number.
And while she can't decide,
the nails are doing strange things.
What is going on?
I think I know -- look.
Oh, look!
The Problem Blob!
Bet he's the one making things go wrong.
We need all the information we've got. 
Info on screen.
He slimed the builder to make things go wrong.
Yes, look. The builder can't choose which nails to use.
They're behaving strangely.
More problems.
Who is it this time?
The man with balloons.
He's been blobbed! 
Oh, no!
He knows he needs about six balloons for his show,
but he can't work out if he has enough.
He's having a lot of trouble! 
Poor man.
More problems.
A teacher doesn't know if she's got enough children to help her.
Blobbed! She's been blobbed!
She needs about four children to help her.
She can't choose which group has got about the right number.
Don't say a teacher's in trouble!
If she doesn't choose soon, the kids will behave strangely.
You're right!
Look!
Poor lady.
5, we've got to sort these problems out.
I know. If we don't stop the problem blob, things could get even worse.
You want about four sandwiches.
You can't decide which plate has got about the right number.
The sandwiches might start behaving strangely.
If you needed about three plants, but couldn't decide which pot,
the plants might start acting strangely as well.
If the dancing cow needed four shoes,
but couldn't choose the right group, the shoes might go potty.
We've got to sort these problems out.
Agents, any ideas?
It's because everybody can't decide if they've got the right number.
How can they decide quickly?
Wait a minute! What about our game of Estimate?
No time for playing now, 3.
No, I mean, could the people estimate what number it is?
Yes, like we did!
It's worth a try.
We'll need to send them Brain Gain.
I can do it! Me, me, me!
Joined-up thinking
Let's start with the builder.
Estimate! Estimate!
She's estimating.
She knows she needs six nails.
Just check if it's about six.
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.
It WAS about six.
Well done, that builder.
Sort the others now, 5. 
OK.
Keep the Brain Gain going, 3.
Estimate!
Let's sort the balloon man.
Time for some Brain Gain.
Estimate!
He's estimating.
He needs about six balloons...
.. and he's got about six.
Better sort everyone else, 5.
Estimate, then count, if you want.
Yeah!
She's estimating. This group has got about four children.
Counting to check.
She's got one, two, three, four, five children.
Very close to the four she needed.
Her estimating worked fine.
Do the boy and his construction.
He needs to estimate
which lot is about four.
Counting to check.
One, two, three, four, five.
Very close.
Well done, 5. We did it!
Estimating sorted things out.
One more thing still to sort out -- the Problem Blob.
THE PROBLEM BLOB GURGLES
How can we stop it doing weird things?
Estimating sorted the other things. Try it with the Problem Blob.
OK, 5. You've got to make the Problem Blob spurt some blobs.
And then we'll estimate how many.
OK, I'll make him spurt.
Be careful.
And you get ready to estimate how many blobs.
Problem Blob, we're estimating how many globs of slime you make.
THE PROBLEM BLOB MOANS 
He didn't like that.
Come on, blobbery blubber. Blob us. We'll estimate how many.
Quick! Find the blobs of slime!
Brain Gain to help you estimate.
Estimating about five blobs. 
Looks good to me.
One, two, three, four, five!
Excellent estimate!
Ha-ha, blobbery!
He's getting angry.
Estimate! Estimate!
About how many?
About ten!
Estimates about ten.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Really close.
Great estimate. 
We've got that blob beaten.
He's getting very angry! 
He's going into overload!
He won't be making any more trouble for a while.
ALL: Yes!
Come back now, 5.
Hurrah!
All clear for landing.
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5!
Well done, 5.
He was so blobbery!
We've got it down on screen.
His pieces were all over the place. 
I love those nails.
I wish I had some.
I'd like some of those balloons. They're mad.
Those children were strange too. 
I wouldn't want to be the teacher.
But we sorted them all. Estimate!
Sorted them out by estimating.
That's better.
Even the children calmed down.
And we sorted the Problem Blob. 
Well done, 5.
And made the blob very grumpy.
Go!
Agh! Who put that there?
Estimate!
Not very close to my number 3.
I estimate one problem blobbery blob...
.. and yes, I was right!
One!
Remember, you may need to estimate quickly. Can you do it?
Get ready to estimate...
.. and then call the Numberjacks.
Estimate how many. 
Good luck!
Zero! Zero!
Zero!
One, Two and Three are waiting for you.
It's no good. Zero said he wanted to play hide-and-seek,
but I don't know where he's gone.
Ha-ha. 
He's probably causing trouble somewhere.
You know what he's like!
Ooh.
WHIRRING
Now, actually, I'm pretty good at counting to ten,
so I'll count and you hide.
Off you go.
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten!
Coming, ready or not!
WHIRRING
Seen you! I can see you, One!
Now I can't! How did you do that?
Two, I can see you!
Wow!
That's a clever trick. Show me how you do it.
All right, you've had your fun, One and Two... Huh?
I'm not playing hide-and-seek with you two again.
You can do your clever hiding as much as you like.
Have you seen One and Two's trick? 
There's a call coming in.
Come on. 
What have we got today?
Agent 33 here. 
What's the problem?
Things are going wrong. 
But not for long!
It's this boy... 
Hold on. I'm putting it on screen.
That's not his hat. 
And he can't get it off.
And there's another problem.
Those are the gardener's boots!
One chef's hat and two welly boots?
We'll definitely send someone out. 
Thank you!
You up for it? 
OK. 
Right. Get ready for launching!
Good luck, Five. 
Hang on. Can you see anything wrong with the launcher?
No. 
I thought it was making a strange noise.
No, probably all right. 
OK then. Checking the room...
All clear. Let's go!
Five, four, three, two, one, zero!
Finding a five...
Found a five to land on.
OK, Five? 
I'm fine.
Check out that boy and girl. 
OK.
That chef's hat is giving him problems. That's one silly hat!
What caused the problem?
There's Number One!
I can see her. 
One, did you put the chef's hat on the boy's head?
Not me. 
Anyway, time to go home.
Can't move. 
There's something very strange going on here.
Check the girl out.
Those boots are big and silly! 
Come on! What's causing the problem?
It's Two! 
Did you put those two boots on the girl?
No, and I'm stuck.
We've got a big problem here.
How did One and Two get out there?
I was telling you! They disappeared!
Something must have made them disappear. 
First One, then Two.
Who's going to be next?
Oh, no!
One, Two, me!
WHIRRING What's that? 
Sounds like a problem with the launcher.
Maybe that's how One and Two were disappeared. 
Oh, no!
Aaaargh! 
No! Three!
Help me! 
Three!
Got to check that launcher,
cos if I don't, you know who's going to be next -- me!
Five, Three's disappeared now.
This is getting worse and worse. I'll see if I can find her.
Good luck.
Can you do anything with it, Four? 
I'll do my best.
I've found Three!
Help! I'm stuck too. 
And I bet there's going to be another problem,
this time with three things.
I hope I'm not going to do anything mean to him.
One...
Two...
Three!
Oh, dear! Sorry!
Four, you've got to fix that launcher. 
I think this should do it.
Or maybe not.
Aaaargh!
First One, Two and Three, now Four has gone!
Instead of solving problems, the Numberjacks are causing problems!
It's terrible. I'd better look for Four.
That's not one of the builder's tools.
Now she's got two things.
Three things.
Four things!
I bet Four's here somewhere.
I didn't do that. 
'Fraid you did.
Numberjacks are causing problems
and everyone's things have been swapped over.
Calling all Numberjacks out there. We've got a huge problem.
Any Numberjacks nearby, call in.
Oh, Seven! 
What's up, Six?
All of us Numberjacks are causing problems instead of solving them.
I'll get hold of Eight and Nine. We'll be with you as fast as we can.
Five, I'm getting Seven, Eight and Nine to help.
Good, cos we... really... need them.
Oh no, not you two! 
Yes.
One, two, three, four, five!
Whoa!
Six, if Seven, Eight and Nine don't make it, it's all up to you.
I know! But so far I'm all...
Oh, no! Me too!
Six? Six! Where are you?
This is where I am. What mix-up trouble am I going to cause?
One, two, three, four, five, six!
Right, I'm ready to help.
Oh! Oh, no! I'm not. I'm part of the problem too.
One,
two, three,
four, five,
six, seven!
All right, where's the problem?
Oh, no! Here's the problem.
One, two, three,
four, five,
six, seven, eight!
All right everyone, Nine is here. What do I need to do?
Oh no! I'm in trouble too!
One... two... three... four... five...
six... seven... eight... nine.
If Seven, Eight and Nine are stuck too, what will happen?
We've all been causing problems.
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six...
.. Seven, Eight... Nine.
That's all the Numberjacks, isn't it?
Have I forgotten anyone?
Nine, Eight, Seven, Six,
Five, Four, Three, Two, One.
Of course! Zero.
Maybe Zero can save us.
Zero.
Six, can you hear me?
Yes!
We've all forgotten about Zero. He's our only hope!
He might hear us on the screens! Shout! We've got to shout!
'Zero! Zero!
'Zero!'
Oooh.
'Zero, if you can see me...'
'.. you've got to save me.' 
Oooh. 
'And all the Numberjacks.' 
Oooh.
'If you're there, get the Brain Gain machine going.' 
Brain Gain.
'The big purple machine. Please, if you're there, save the Numberjacks.'
Purple...
'Please Zero, if you're there, do it.'
Purple. Brain Gain.
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
Agents, if YOU can hear me, help.
We've got to count back to get us all back to Zero.
Start with Nine.
Nine.
Yes!
Yes! Keep going, Zero. Let's get all those Numberjacks back home.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Zero! Well done!
ALL CHEER
And for once we're all here.
Zero. 
One. 
Two. 
Three.
Four. 
Five. 
Six. 
Seven.
Eight. 
Nine. And can YOU count on more than nine?
How far can you count?
See how far you can get and call the Numberjacks.
And I'll fix that launch machine, once and for all.
OK, you two, you're going to love this. 
Oh, yes?
It's the circle game. 
I know about circles. Round and round and round!
Round and round and round and round and round and round!
I'm back! 
Oh, good(!) 
That was a really good big circle.
I know! 
But this game is about that small red circle. 
Oh, right.
You've got to bounce and slide just the right amount to end up inside.
Sounds good to me! 
Like this.
Oh, bad luck. 
You have a go now.
Oh, right you are.
Give it some go, 4! 
Let's go!
Oh, dear. Not very near at all.
Watch this, watch this! Here goes!
Wheeeee! Aaargh!
Bit strong there, 3. 
Never mind. You show us again, 5.
OK. Heading for the red circle... go!
Come on! 
You can do it! 
Go, 5! Yes!
Right in the middle! 
Well done!
Oh, an agent calling in! 
Let's go!
Agent 28 here. 
Go ahead.
Things are going wrong! Not for long!
It's some children on the beach. 
Hold on. I'm putting it on screen.
Oh, I love frisbees! 
That looks fun!
But look at it now.
It's stuck in his hand!
Not much fun like that.
And this girl's got a problem, too.
Nice food. 
But look at the plate! 
The plate is out of control!
Oh, no!
Definitely problems there, Agent 28. We're on our way. 
Thank you.
Who's going out there? 
I don't know why, but I think this one is for me.
Yes, I'm going out. 
Get ready for launching!
Good luck, 6! Good luck! 
Ready to launch, checking the room's empty.
Hang on. 
I'll ring the bell! Me! 
Oh, all right.
DOORBELL RINGS
Wait a minute... All clear! 
Let's go!
Six! Five! Four!
Three! Two! One! Zero!
Looking for a six.
That's the one!
OK.
Where are those children?
Looks good, that beach. 
That boy is still having trouble.
He's not throwing the frisbee, the frisbee's throwing him!
Dear, oh, dear! Is the girl still in trouble?
Yes, she IS in trouble.
What's going wrong?
Let's have a look.
The frisbee and the plate. There's got to be a link between them.
Agents ringing in!
It's the shape. Look at the shape.
Yes, of course!
They're both circles.
Circle! Circle! 
Looks like we have trouble with circles today.
I've got more trouble to report.
Tell us, quick! 
The cleaner is having trouble with his bucket.
What's the matter with that bucket?
Is it the same shape as the other things that went wrong?
Circle... bad!
That was the Shape Japer! A circle inside the bucket.
She's made that circle go bad. Look. 
He can't stop it! 
Oh, no!
What do we know about the Shape Japer? 
Getting data on screen!
We've got to stop that Shape Japer.
More problems with circles!
The gardener's flowerpot has gone potty!
Circle... gone bad!
The Shape Japer again! 
Making another circle go bad!
It's just like the bucket -- out of control!
Oh, no!
Circles are going completely crazy!
More trouble with the cleaner. 
Got to spot that Shape Japer!
At least there aren't any circles with that vacuum cleaner.
I'm not so sure -- look closely!
Circle... small!
And bad!
Oh, no!
This is really bad!
Bad circles!
More trouble with the gardener! 
I can't be in two places!
Oh, no! The gardener's got a hose, too!
Any dangerous circles here? 
Circle... tiny!
Bad!
All this trouble with circles.
We've got to do something or else anything could happen.
Wheels might come flying off cars and trucks!
Pizzas might go mad!
Or the Shape Japer might spoil a trampoline
and make it too bouncy! 
Aaaaah!
That Shape Japer must be stopped.
More trouble down on the beach.
I'll get back there!
'The girl should be hitting the ball in a circle.
'There's a hole in the bat!'
Bad!
And the Shape Japer has made a circular hole in the bucket.
And another hole in the cup!
Look, Shape Japer, you've got to stop making circles go bad.
Hahaha! Wheee!
We'll not get much sense out of her.
What can we do to stop her?
We must wear that Shape Japer out!
Give her so many circles to worry about, she can't handle it!
Yeah! We've got to make circles.
So many circles the Shape Japer goes potty!
Get the Brain Gain going. Circle making brain gain!
Powering up the Brain Gain machine!
Make circles! Make circles!
ALL: Make circles! Circles!
Sending Brain Gain now!
Yes!
And more circles!
That'll give the Shape Japer plenty to think about.
She's got lots of circles to worry about. Give her more!
More circles!
Aaargh!
Bad!
We've got too many circles for the Shape Japer to handle!
Now some bigger ones! The cleaner!
More circles! Bigger ones!
Ungh...!
Yes! Now the gardener!
More circles!
Ungh...!
The Shape Japer can't handle it!
Ungh!
Aaaaiiieee!
Yeah! 
That's the last we'll see of her for a bit.
And everything back to normal.
Come back now, 6.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One! Two! Three!
Four! Five! Six!
Well done, 6! 
Did the trick! 
We've got it all on screen.
There was trouble on the beach. 
The frisbee was stuck!
And the plate was silly!
The cleaner had problems, too!
And so did the gardener.
All that Shape Japer's fault! Making circles go bad!
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Lucky we gave that Shape Japer too many circles to handle!
We did it!
You did it, 6. 
We all did it.
But you're the one who went out there. You said it ought to be you.
Why should 6 be good with circles?
Oh! Cos you've got a circle! 
Oh, yes!
And a very good circle it is, too.
Have people got circles? Have you got a circle on you?
Look very closely in the mirror.
Find those circles and call the Numberjacks!
Wow! All the buddy blocks are big.
Yes, and I think I'm going to be good at jumping up them today.
Show us, then.
I can jump all the way up to my number.
One... two... three... four.
Pretty impressive, I think you'll agree.
Four... three... two... one... zero.
All the way to my own number and back.
I can do that!
One... two... three.
And I can go on to four.
One more than my number.
Well, of course, I COULD go to one more than my number.
Oh, could you?
Yes, I could easily go to five,
but we haven't got a tower of five buddy blocks.
Well, we could have.
Oh, could we?
You watch.
Buddy block one, please go and add yourself to four to make five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Now you can go to one more than your number.
Yes, good(!)
Here goes!
I'm on two.
On three.
You can do it!
Five. Yes!
Yes! 
SIREN
Well done! Come on.
We have an agent calling in.
Agent 16, here. 
What's the problem?
Things are going wrong.
But not for long.
It's down on the beach! 
Hold on, I'm putting it on-screen.
She WAS going into the sea with her flippers on.
Nothing wrong with that. 
But look at her now.
That's not where flippers go.
And there was a boy playing football. 
Perfectly fine.
Now look!
That's not allowed. Use your feet, not your hands.
Definitely got problems here.
So are you sending someone? 
Sure are!
Thanks!
Who's going? Who's going?
Tell you what, this one's for me.
Number Five.
Checking the room.
All clear! 
Let's go!
ALL: Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Going to find a five.
Found a five.
Phew! Made it.
Can you see the boy and girl? 
Yes.
What's happening with them?
Agent 42 here. They've got things switched round.
They're using their hands instead of their feet.
OK, we need to know more. More!
There are more problems, I'm afraid. 
We can handle it.
More problems with hands being where feet should be.
That's not where you wear shoes.
It's going to be hard to do the gardening with those on his hands.
That's funny -- hands and feet getting completely mixed up.
Come in. We really need to know what's going on here.
Hands swapped for feet -- what's that all about?
We need to see a close-up of a hand. 
Close-up of a hand.
And a close-up of a foot. 
Close-up of a foot.
Is there anything the same about a hand and a foot?
Anything?
Count the digits. 
Count the fingers and the thumb.
One, two, three, four fingers and one thumb is five digits.
Count the toes. One, two, three, four, five toes.
That's why hands and feet have been swapped over.
They've both got five things.
And if hands and feet keep getting swapped over, anything could happen.
Yey! Woo!
Instead of a paddle dipping your toes in the water,
you'd have to paddle with your hands.
Instead of scooting with your foot, you'd have to scoot with your hand.
And skipping would be really hard -- for everybody.
We've got to sort this problem out.
But who's causing all these problems? Who can it be?
You'd better believe it. It's me.
I know that voice.
I know that face.
Yes, my face. Isn't it lovely?
Handsome and, yes, oh, so bubbly.
Putting data on The Puzzler on-screen.
You've got to stop messing people up.
Who's gonna stop me? Little you?
That's not something YOU can do.
Let's liven up these people's lives.
Have fun with things that come in fives.
My little tricks have just begun.
It's time for me to have more fun. Yeah!
I'll get after him.
Anything in fives could be in trouble.
More trouble for the poor lady.
She's got five nails to paint.
Oh, no!
Ah-ha ha ha!
PLAYS TRUMPET BADLY
Ah-ha ha ha!
Puzzler, stop messing up fives.
To stop things now would be so sad.
I love to make five things go bad.
Making five is what I can do.
Oh, no, you can't. I'm bubbling you! 
R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.
Help! Oh, no!
Oh, aaahhhh!
You all need help, that's very true. 
And here's that chance I'm giving you.
Find two numbers that add to five,
then I will let five out alive.
Come on, think!
Two numbers that add to five.
Come on, we've got to sort this.
There's five nails altogether.
One, two, three, four, five.
And four of them are red and one is blue.
Four and one make five.
We've done it! We know how to make five with two numbers.
Four and one.
Got to send the Brain Gain to rescue Five.
Hang on, it should be me. 
What?!
Me and One. Four and one make five.
I'll go and get Number One. 
Quick!
How's it going, Numberjacks?
Have you got the problem cracked?
Yes, we have. Come on, One.
Getting brain power now! Brain Gain!
Two numbers that make five. Four. 
One. 
Make five.
Four and one make five. Four and one make five.
Sending Brain Gain.
Four. 
And one. 
Make five.
Hooray!
Going somewhere, Five? No way.
R-R-R-R-R-R-R.
We found two numbers that make five.
Yes, I know, but I'm afraid I've changed my mind. 
What?
Yes, and now I say, "Add up to five a different way."
We've got to do it another way.
What?! Four and one not good enough?
You were great.
Yeah.
But we've got to find another way to add up to five.
Agents, any ideas?
Watch the man with the trumpet.
Putting on-screen.
PLAYS TRUMPET BADLY
Watch his fingers and thumb. Five digits.
Some digits move up and down and do the playing,
and the other two don't move. 
Yes! Count the digits that move.
One, two, three. Oh, yes!
And the digits that don't move, one on either side. That's two!
Three and two make five.
One, two, three, four, five.
I'll get Two in the Brain Gain Machine.
Yes! Three and two make five.
Another way of making five.
Send that Brain Gain.
Come on, Two. Three... 
And two... 
BOTH: Makes five.
Sending Brain Gain.
Yes! Three and two make five.
I must admit that yes, they do.
First four and one, then three and two.
Two different ways of making five.
So, just as quick as I arrived, off I go.
I'll set you free.
But I'll be back. Remember me!
ALL: Hooray! Yes! 
Done it!
Well done!
Everything back to normal.
PLAYS TRUMPET WELL
Come on back now, Five.
All clear.
ALL: One, two, three, four, five.
Well done, Five. 
I needed everyone's help today.
That's what the Numberjacks are all about. 
Got everything on-screen.
Everyone was using their hands instead of their feet.
That's not how to play!
You can't go wearing shoes on your hands.
Or boots.
Yuck!
Oh, no!
Lucky you found two ways to add to five.
Four and one.
Three and two.
Everything sorted!
See? We made five for you.
Oh, thanks, Three.
Two different ways.
I wonder... 
What?
If MY four buddy blocks were on top of One's, instead of underneath,
would it still add up to five?
Check it.
Is four with one on top the same as one with four on top?
Find out and call the Numberjacks.
This is a good book.
And this is a good collection of beautiful things.
So I've heard -- lots of times.
Lovely. 
If they're so lovely, perhaps you should share them.
Well, that's one for me and that's one for me...
That's not very fair. 
And that's one for me. 
Three,
you're being a little bit selfish. 
They are my beautiful things
and if I gave any of them away they'd be sad. So sad.
They'd probably enjoy the peace and quiet. 
Yes.
I'm so sorry, Four, but I can't share any of my beautiful things.
You can't share anything! 
I can! I can! For instance...
Six, can I borrow your buddy blocks? 
Yes!
Thank you!
So, sharing the buddy blocks, like this. One for you...
and one, two, three, four, five for me. Shared. 
Shared?
It's not fair sharing.
Oh, now he wants me to do fair sharing!
That's the whole point.
You share things equally so everyone gets the same.
We've got to have the same number. Do it like this.
One for you... and one for me.
One for you
and one for me.
And one for you
and one for me.
I've got one, two, three
and you've got one, two, three.
Fair shares. 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do you think I can have my fair share of peace and quiet?
No, none of us can. Come on.
Come on, you lot. 
Who's calling in?
Agent 28 here.
Go ahead. 
Things are going wrong.
But not for long. -- It's the children on the beach.
I'm putting it on screen.
Sandwiches -- yeah!
They're sharing them fairly. Oh, yes.
But look! 
Oh, no. 
She has no sandwiches.
The boy has them all. 
He's trying.
But it's not working. 
This needs sorting out.
So... 
We'll send someone. Don't worry.
Thanks. We need your help. -- The Numberjacks are on their way!
Hey! 
And which Numberjack is it? 
Today...
I think it's going to be me.
So much for fair shares!
Number Six!
Good luck, Six.
Checking the room's empty...
All clear! 
Let's go!
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero!
Looking for a six...
That's the one for us.
Ha! OK, ready to sort things out.
I fancy a paddle on that beach. 
We've got work to do!
I'm watching out for things going wrong. They seem all right.
Oh, no! 
She's got both spades.
What's going on here? 
Agents, call in. We need some help here.
Agent 101 here. Things aren't being shared fairly.
Instead of people having the same number of things each,
one person has got all of them.
That boy had all the sandwiches. 
And the girl had both the spades.
Even when they try to be fair, things aren't working out.
Six, can you see anything? What is causing all the trouble?
I can spot something...
Look at that spade.
What is it? 
Going in closer.
Oh yes, look, a blob. That's what made the spades go wrong.
And look at the plates.
A blob of slime.
Which means... 
Yes, look.
Yucky yucky! 
Getting the data on screen -
all about the problem blob.
Yucky yucky yuck!
That problem blob is going to take some sorting out.
Yes, and quick. He's been blobbing problems all over the place.
Tell us about it. 
The gardener's in a lot of trouble.
Getting it on screen.
He's dividing the plants between the two pots.
Three plants in each pot. That's fair so far...
What's the problem? -- Here's the problem.
Blobs.
The plants are on the move. 
Those plants won't stay divided fairly.
Those pots haven't got their fair shares of plants.
And now the plants are too crowded.
The problem blob is stopping things being shared fairly!
More problems, more problems.
She's divided her bags up -- two on each arm. 
Checking for blobs...
Spotted some blobs!
Spotted some blobs!
Oh no, now the bags aren't shared fairly.
Poor lady! 
Mean blob!
BLOB LAUGHS
Hey, there's a very boring game of football on the beach.
That was an easy goal. 
That's cos the players have been blobbed!
They're nearly all on one side.
Five against one?
That's not fair.
If the problem blob keeps stopping things being shared out fairly,
anything could happen.
There might be two bulls with two horns each.
Then one bull would get three horns
and the other bull is left with just one!
Or instead of two cars having four wheels each,
one car would have six wheels and the other car would only have two!
Or instead of two clocks with two hands each,
you'd have one clock with four hands and one clock with no hands,
and you couldn't tell the time with either of them!
That problem blob has got to be stopped. 
Yes.
Send me the Brain Gain and I'll do it. 
We need to share things fairly.
I'll get the Brain Gain machine going. Powering up...
Share things fairly. Share things fairly.
Share things fairly. Share things fairly.
Fair shares. Fair shares.
Sending Brain Gain now...
Share the sandwiches fairly!
Share the spades fairly!
Share the plants fairly!
Share the bags fairly!
Divide the players up fairly!
That's better!
We did it! 
Hurrah!
Hang on, I think there's going to be another problem.
Those children and their flippers! 
They need to share the flippers out.
But look! 
Oh, no!
They won't share out fairly now.
That's not very fair.
Let's share those flippers fairly!
But there's three children to share them. 
Oh, dear. Now what do we do?
No problem. To share them out equally...
One each, one at a time. That's the way to be fair.
OK. One each, one at a time.
One each, one at a time.
Yes! Two each, shared fairly.
We've still got to deal with the problem blob.
He's near the gardener.
Share out its blobs of slime until they're all gone.
Yes! A blob for every blade of grass in the garden.
That's loads of blobs!
Share the blobs. Share the blobs.
A blob for every blade of grass in the garden.
It's using up a lot of blobs.
It's used up all the blobs!
He won't be making trouble for a long time. We did it!
THEY CHEER 
Come back now, Six.
All clear for landing.
One, two, three, four, five, six!
That was scary!
Sharing did the trick. 
We've got it all on screen.
There was trouble with the sandwiches -- not shared fairly.
Nor were the spades.
And those plants were a problem, all in one pot.
That lady's bags were a problem too.
And so was five playing against one.
We sorted things, even when three people were sharing.
One each, one at a time! He won't be making trouble for a long time.
And then something really strange happened.
More! 
You were right, it is a good book.
And so is the book that Five's reading to us. 
We're sharing books.
Three Numberjacks reading this book. 
And three reading this book.
Did I hear there's reading going on? Love a good book! 
Yeah, me too.
Which book are you going to read? 
Mmm...
Wow, now there are eight Numberjacks.
If we are all shared out fairly,
how many Numberjacks will be reading each book?
Work it out and call the Numberjacks.
BALL SQUIDGES
I like watching the bloop ball.
And listening. Very peaceful.
Well, I like looking at my beautiful things.
And I think these... yes.
These are my three favourites.
One, two, three. Lovely.
One, two... 
Three! Your counting is interrupting my blooping.
Well, your blooping is interrupting my counting!
And counting beautiful things is a bit more important.
That's what you think. Bloop, bloop...
Hey, Five, look! My three favourite beautiful things.
Let's have a look.
Oh, better count them again. 
There's still three. 
But they've moved!
Yes, but... 
Well, I suppose I can see there are three. But...
One, two, three. Just to be sure.
Bloop, bloop!
Four! 
Aaaagh! Oh, sorry.
Got a bit bloopy there.
My beautiful things are all over the place!
I definitely better count them now.
There's still three things.
Even I can see that, and I'm bloopy! 
Yes, but...
One, two, three. Ah!
There's a problem. Come on!
Don't go away!
Here we go again! A call coming in.
'Agent 28 here.'
Things are going wrong.
But not for long! -- Have a look.
Hold on! I'm putting it on screen.
The boy had some marbles, but they wouldn't move. 
Not much fun!
And then... 
Not much fun at all.
Really bad. And this girl had some dolls.
And they fell over. And then they disappeared!
There's someone on their way soon. 
Thanks!
It's me, it's got to be me!
What? 
It's got, got, got to be me that goes out!
Why? 
Didn't you notice? Put them on screen, quick!
Didn't you notice how many things there were? Three!
Three marbles, three dolls.
This has to be investigated by Numberjack Three! Me!
OK. 
Yes! 
Three is going out!
Who's going out there? 
Number Three!
Are you sure about this, Three? 
Yes! Just send me out there!
Ready for launch! Check the room's empty...
The room's not empty!
Ringing the doorbell. 
DING DONG!
Nearly clear...
They've gone.
Here we go!
ALL: Three, two, one, zero!
Looking for a three...
Need a three to land on...
Got one! 
Yaaaaaargh!
Unh! Yes, I did it!
Plenty more to do, Three.
I'm on my way.
Three's going to need help. 
Agent calling.
What do you think?
Things have been coming in threes. Three marbles, three dolls. 
Yeah?
You'd better watch out for more lots of three things.
Good thinking! Three!
Shhh! I'm on a secret mission.
I know, but watch out for things that there are three of.
I will.
Can you see three of anything?
Yes! Look! The three red balloons.
Something might go wrong with them. 
Yes, you're right.
Oh, no! Argh!
POP! POP! POP!
Three! What's going on?
I don't know. The three balloons have all popped.
Can you see anything suspicious? 
Well, I...
I know that hat. 
It's the Number Taker's!
Argh! I want to go home. 
Stick with it, Three.
Give me all our information on the Number Taker. 
On screen.
He's mucking up everything that comes in threes.
Where's he going now? 
You've got to follow him, Three. 
What?!
He's looking for things in threes. 
To make them disappear. 
Right.
If the Number Taker spots things in threes, anything could happen.
He might see three things here.
One, two, three. The three clouds.
He might see three things here. Three wheels.
Or the Number Taker might find three things here.
Three flags.
Someone's got to stop him.
Three has got to stop him. 
I hope she can do it.
I can see that meanie, Number Taker. He's looking for things in threes.
How many people?
Phew! Only two. 
Oh, no!
Can anyone spot what I can see? 
Three chairs!
I know. And so does the Number Taker!
He's got a magnet!
He's taken one of the chairs! 
Not a good start to their lovely meal.
Oh, no! The second chair!
That's the third chair going.
That Number Taker is ruining their meal.
Try to spot anything else that's in threes. 
Look!
More threes!
The lady's rings! And the buttons on the man's sleeve!
The Number Taker's in control again.
Oh dear, oh dear! 
This is terrible! 
We've got to stop this.
Agents! Agents! Any ideas? How do we stop the Number Taker?
The Number Taker is controlling things that come in threes.
If there weren't any threes, he couldn't do anything.
How do we stop there being threes? 
Change the number of things.
Add one more thing to three things, make it four things!
A much better number. 
I'll get Number One into the Brain Gain.
Hang on, Three. Help is on the way.
Go! Three add one makes four.
Three... 
Add one... 
Makes four!
Sending Brain Gain now!
Woah! Waaaaah!
Three add one makes four!
Three add one makes four.
There's four rings and four buttons.
The Number Taker can't control things any more. We did it!
Oh, no! Trouble again. 
There's three people!
Quick! Get another person.
OK. Sorry about this.
Three add one makes four!
Did the trick! 
We did it.
The Number Taker's not happy. 
We did it! We did it!
Watch out, Three! 
He's after threes!
I'm a three! Argh!
Help!
Help!
More Brain Gain! Three... 
Add one... 
Makes four!
I'm four! I'm four.
I can't look. 
Three! Four! Three! Four! Three! Four!
You did it, Three! 
ALL: Yeah!
Hurray! You've got a very funny shape, Four.
It's a very NICE shape. 
Maybe. But get me back to normal, please.
Four... take away one... is three.
OK. Four take away one...
.. makes three! That's better. 
Come on back now, Three.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One, two, three!
Well done, Three. 
I did it! 
It's all on screen.
The boy lost his marbles.
And the dolls went.
There was all sort of problems for the man and the lady.
Three things in trouble every time. 
Very silly.
Adding one and making things four sorted everything out.
And I had to become four.
Hurray! 
Everything's sorted.
Good to be back with my beautiful things.
And with my bloop ball.
It was only when you turned into the same shape as me
that you beat the Number Taker. 
He ran off
because it was such a horrible sight. 
Are you saying I'm ugly?
Well... I wouldn't call you one of my beautiful things, but...
you are one of my favourite things.
Oh... oh... I've come over all bloopy again. Oh!
But just in case that Number Taker is still around,
watch out for things that come in threes.
If you see any, call the Numberjacks.
Right, hide and seek! Hide and seek! 
Yes, calm down!
I'll hide. 
And I'll seek.
COUNTS TO TEN QUICKLY 
Hey! That's a bit quick.
It is, isn't it? I've been practising.
But I haven't had time to hide. 
That's not MY fault.
The rules are count to ten and then start seeking.
But you must start slowly.
But I'm in a fast mood today. I can't do slow.
But you must do it slowly, like this.
One...
two...
three... 
SHE YAWNS
four...
five...
six... 
SHE HUMS
seven...
eight...
nine...
Oh, are you all right?
No, I am not! I can't count THAT slowly.
I'd fall asleep before I got to one.
All right then. All right.
If you can't count slowly, count more numbers. 
More numbers?
Count to ten and keep on going.
OK. COUNTS TO TEN QUICKLY
..11...
12...
16...
14...
No, no, no.
You're supposed to be hiding!
And you're supposed to be counting properly past ten, like this.
11...12...13...
14...15...16...
..17...18...
19...20.
Three? Three!
I'M the one who's supposed to be hiding.
Three!
Your slow counting has made me go bonkers!
Aaargh!
That's better.
As I was saying...11...
WHIRRING Thank heavens for that. Come on!
12...13...
What's going on? 
17...18...
Agent 33 here. Things are going wrong!
But not for long!
This boy on the beach... 
Hang on, I'll put it on screen.
.. He had one sandcastle. 
Very nice.
And then suddenly he had lots more. One, two, three, four, five more.
Then another five more... Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
And with the one he already had, that makes... 
11!
So instead of one sandcastle, he has 11 sandcastles all over him.
Right, we need to send someone out there. 
Thanks!
Four's been doing some useful counting today. 
Have I?
Looks like it's Number Four.
Number Four! 
ALARM SOUNDS
Keep practising the counting, Four.
OK. 11...
'12...' 
Checking the room's clear.
Only Jasper. He's not bothered.
Stand by, Four. 
13...14...
And off you go!
ALL: Four, three, two, one, zero!
Need a four to land on.
Found a four.
'OK, Four?'. 
Yes, I'm OK.
Good luck, Four.
I'm looking for anything strange.
And I think I've seen something strange.
I know who that is. 
So do I. The Numbertaker. 
Aaargh!
We need some info on the Numbertaker.
What's the Numbertaker up to? 
I don't know but I bet it is mean.
I can see the Numbertaker.
He's written a three. 
He's bad, writing on the wall.
He's writing some more.
He's written a one in front of the three. 
Why?
There's five more. And another five. That's ten...
And the other 3 make 13.
13 candyflosses, yummy!
Somehow I don't think it will be good.
Oh no! 
Her mum is going to be angry.
What's going on here? What IS the Numbertaker up to?
The Numbertaker is a Number MAKER today.
He made the number 3 into 13 by putting a 1 in front of it.
That's amazing.
Just putting a one in front makes it ten more.
3 becomes 13. Too big a number to handle.
That's how he made extra sandcastles.
I found some extra shots of what happened.
It's the Numbertaker MAKING numbers.
One sandcastle...
and a one in front makes it ten more?
Which is 11.
Just putting a one in front makes it ten more.
If the Numbertaker keeps putting a one in front of numbers,
anything could happen.
A racing car with four wheels may become a car with 14 wheels!
Ten more wheels... Ten becomes 14!
CRASH!
A glove with four fingers and a thumb, five digits, may get bigger.
A glove for ten extra digits, making 15 digits!
And a crab with six legs will get ten more legs, making it 16 legs!
Far too many.
That Numbertaker must be stopped.
The Numbertaker's up to his tricks again.
What's he up to now? 
She's got one sunshade.
She's got ten more! 11!
We've got to stop this.
Any ideas? How do we get things to the number they were before?
The Numbertaker put one in front to make the numbers bigger.
We've got to get rid of the one -- that means ten more.
If it's 14, get rid of the one in front and it becomes four again.
I'll get the Brain Gain going.
We're sending Brain Gain to sort things out.
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
Rub out the one -- that means ten more.
Rub out the one that means ten more.
11. 11 goes back to one.
There's 13.
Get rid of the one and make it three.
This is good. We'll sort the Numbertaker.
We need more Brain Gain though.
You got it. One! One! 
What did you say, Three?
I said one! Oh no! I should've said rub out the one.
You might've made an extra one.
Oh! That's weird.
Careful, that Brain Gain might turn a number into ten more.
Wooooh! Aaaah! 
Four, what's up?
Wow-eeee!
That's not four any more.
That's 14. A one next to a four... means I'm 14. I'm so grown up!
Four, we've got Brain Gain work to do.
Yeah, hang on a minute. I'm 14, a teenager.
Nearly a grown-up. 
Four! We've got work to do.
Wait a minute, I've got things to do. Call me Mr Cool, yeah.
Oh no! Teenagers are a bit wild sometimes.
I'm not Four, I'm 14, the coolest dude you've ever seen.
We've got to get Four back to normal.
We've got to get him back to being Four.
I'll send the proper Brain Gain this time to turn 14 back to four.
Rub out the one that means ten more.
14 get rid of one is four again.
Yeah, watch 14 go! 
Wait till he stops. 
Yeah!
Get rid of the one that's making four into 14.
Woah! Aaaah!
I'm Four again. 
Good. 
It was fun.
But you've got work that a teenager couldn't handle.
He's too busy singing.
Ok then, let's get rid of those ones.
11 sunshades back to one.
Now sort that Numbertaker.
Er, which one?
That funny Brain Gain you sent through has turned one Numbertaker
into 11 Numbertakers.
They don't like each other.
They're going to suck each other up! 
They're disappearing!
ALL: Hurray!
Done it. Come back now, Four.
All clear for landing.
ALL: One, two, three, four!
Great work, Four. 
Thanks. It was fun being 14.
It was fun watching the Numbertakers disappear. 
We have it on screen.
One sand castle, 11 sand castles.
Three, one in front, that's 13.
Woah! That Numbertaker.
Making everything ten more than before.
Then Four was ten more. 14!
Oh my word.
Too many Numbertakers. Going... 
Going... 
Gone!
OK, One, you come up right next to me. And now we're 13. 
Yeah.
Oh yeah! You must stay next to me or I can't be a teenager.
Oh, hi. 
Hi.
Say it. BOTH: 13.
That's good. 
If one was in front of seven, or eight, or nine,
I wonder what numbers that would make.
Find out and call the Numberjacks.
Woah! 
Hello, Four!
What d'you think of this?
Wow! That looks good! It's great!
Fantastic! Erm...
What is it?
It's a moving mat.
Wow! Just moves the car, then, does it?
No, I think it can move anything, really.
I'd love to see if it would work on you.
Oh, WOULD you?!
Where do I stand?
There's great. 
OK.
(I hope I can work this!)
I'm ready!
(I must be mad!)
OK, ready? I'm switching on!
Going to slide you forwards!
Wo-o-o-o-w!
And... back!
Ya-a-a-a-ah!
And slide you left...
and right!
Yar-o-o-o-o!
This is GREAT!
Well, that was exciting!
And I can TURN you too!
Turn you this way...
Yow!
Hey!
It's stuck!
Well, get it unstuck, then!
Yaroo-o-o-o!
Hurgh!
Did the trick!
Ooh... I'm giddy.
I haven't QUITE got the hang of the controls.
BLEEPING
Quick! Come on!
I'll do my best! 
HE GROANS
Come on, we've got a call coming in!
Who's calling?
Agent 17 here. Things are going wrong.
But not for long!
Look at this.
Putting it on screen.
Whoops... Still a bit dizzy.
On screen!
She's looking at a book. -- I like books!
But this book MOVES!
It's sliding!
That's a very strange book!
Very strange! 
We'd better send someone out straightaway!
I'm up for it! 
Thanks.
Number Five!
SIREN BLARES
Checking all clear for launch.
All clear!
ALL: Five! Four! Three!
Two! One!
Zero!
Finding a five...
Finding a five...
Found some fives...
That's a good five!
Phew! Made it!
I'll go and find that girl.
What's going on with that book?
Agents calling in!
Agent 41 here. That book keeps sliding about.
Agent 60 here. It's like Six's moving mat.
Of course!
Left...
Right...
And forward...
OK. We know what's going on.
Sounds like we've got more problems!
That spoilt his painting!
There's a lot going wrong in this house!
MORE sliding!
EVIL CACKLING
It's the Shape Japer! What do we know about the Japer?
Data on screen now.
Looks like the Shape Japer's back.
But why's the Shape Japer interested in a book, a painting and a plate?
Putting them on screen!
The Shape Japer must like their shapes.
The book is a rectangle. 
So's the painting.
And the plate is a circle.
So THAT'S why the Shape Japer is messing about.
They're all rectangles or circles.
Shape Japer! You've got to stop sliding these shapes around!
Kay...
Kay...
What? You're going to stop sliding things?
Yah...
Wow! That was EASY!
Erm... Maybe you can come home now, Five.
I don't think so!
SHE LAUGHS MOCKINGLY
NOW what's happening?
The Japer's turning shapes now.
Right! Shape Japer!
No sliding OR turning the shapes!
Kay!
You sure?
Yah...
I'm not sure she means it.
And if she keeps on sliding and turning shapes,
anything could happen!
She might look for a circle and see the sun.
And then she'd slide the sun around in the sky!
Light...
Dark...
Light...
Or... she might look for a rectangle,
and see the window and start sliding it about.
REALLY confusing!
Or she might look for another rectangle and see the door,
and start sliding it...
Oh! 
.. or turning it, and you'd never get in your house!
That Shape Japer could cause all sorts of trouble.
It's Agent 106 here. The Shape Japer is moving people now!
Oh, no! Where is she?
With the cleaner. 
I'm on my way!
Got the cleaner.
He's seen some mess that needs mopping up.
It's the Shape Japer!
Back!
Left!
Right!
Turn!
Turn!
Back!
SHE CACKLES
Oh, no! The poor cleaner looks terrible.
We're going to have to sort this mess out for him.
But the poor man can't move!
How are we going to move him?
Have we got anything we can move him with?
Use the moving mat. 
That can make things move!
Of course! If we can connect it to the Brain Gain machine...
We can do it! Come on!
Don't worry, Five! We've got a cunning plan.
Good! Cos the cleaner needs all the help we can give him!
Poor man!
The mat's connected to the Brain Gain!
Getting Brain Power now! Brain Gain!
Right. First we've got to get him OUT of the mess.
OK. How do we move him first?
Turn, turn, turn, turn!
Oh, no!
Sorry!
Let's get him out of this mess.
And he goes... forward!
He's going to need more water on his mop.
Turn him! 
Turn him to the bucket.
Turn to the bucket!
Now... Forward a bit!
Yes!
Now, how do we get him pointing at the mess?
Turn him again!
Turn to the mess!
Forward a bit... 
Back a bit...
Forward...
Back! 
Forward!
Back!
He's happy now!
There's nothing like a nice, clean floor!
Great! I can come back.
Wargh!
Oh, the Shape Japer's back!
SHE CACKLES
Give me some help!
Forward!
Back!
Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!
ALL: Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!
Argh!
Forward, forward, forward!
ALL: Forward, forward, forward!
That sorted her!
Come back now, Five!
All clear for landing.
One, two, three, four, five!
Well done, Five! 
I'm still a bit dizzy!
I know how you feel!
All on screen!
That book kept sliding!
And the painting!
And the plate kept sliding too!
Then things started turning! 
Like the painting.
It's hard to eat when the plate's turning!
And it was all the Shape Japer's fault!
Sliding and turning circles and rectangles!
And making life hard for the cleaner!
He was moved all over the place!
WE sorted things out!
Forward... Back...
Forward, back! 
Job well done!
And we got rid of the Shape Japer! 
All sorted!
Are you SURE this is a good idea?
I can definitely do it. Moving two numbers at once.
Oh, dear.
Let's GO!
Forward...
Ooh... 
Back...
Left... Right!
See? I CAN do it!
Careful!
Ooh!
Ooh! Sorry!
Look! Two looks a different shape when she turns around!
But One looks the same shape.
Can you think of two other Numberjacks
that look the same shape when they're turned round the other way?
Find out... and call the Numberjacks!
Hello, and welcome to the Grand Jumping Six Festival!
Three! 
What?
There's only us here! 
We can still call it a festival.
I've even put up some flags.
So, let's get on with the jumping.
OK, we start from here, and we have to jump six squares,
to get to number six.
Can we do as many jumps as we like?
Three! You don't have to be the announcer all the time!
Sorry! Sorry.
And yes, you can take as many jumps as you need to get to six.
And first to jump is... 
Number One!
How many squares are you going to jump at a time?
Just one, I'm only a little number.
Let's see how many jumps will Number One take to get to six!
Go!
One, two, three, four, five, six!
Hurray! 
Hurray!
I'm Number Two, so I'm jumping two squares at a time.
One jump... two jumps...
Three jumps by Number Two gets to six.
Hurray! 
Yeah! 
And next, it's...
Me! Yay!
And Number Three -- that's me -- will be jumping three at a time.
One jump...
Two jumps...
Three -- that's me -- did two jumps of three.
Hurray! 
Hurray!
And now, Number Six, how many jumps will you be taking?
Well, Number Three, I'm going to try to do it in one jump of six.
Oooh! 
Oooh!
Jumping six squares in just one jump of six, it's Number Six!
Hey!
Fantastic! Just one jump of six.
We all jumped six squares, in our own different ways.
BLEEPING 
Time for action! 
Jump to it!
Come on, come on! 
We've got an Agent calling in. 
Who?
Agent 22 here. Things are going wrong.
But not for long!
It's the kids at the holiday club. 
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
It's the dice game, look.
There's nothing there!
Let's have a look.
There's one, two, three, four, five...
What's missing? 
Me!
Six! My number's missing!
Could you send someone? 
Yes, we'll send me.
Thanks!
Number Six!
Good luck, Six. 
Checking all clear for launch.
All clear!
Go, go, go!
Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Zero!
Looking for a six...
Still looking... that's the one!
Keep your eyes open.
Are there any more problems with the number sixes here?
What about that ladder?
Wow, what happened there?
Agents calling in!
Agent 41 here. Count the steps.
It's Agent 60 here.
Count exactly how many steps she took.
One, two, three, four, five, six!
Six steps!
That must be why it disappeared.
Right, keep your eyes open for more sixes!
Any sixes there?
Just checking.
Two lots of three. One, two, three, four, five, six.
Six things again!
It's six again. The sixes are disappearing.
Two lots of three are six.
Agent 106 here. Are there any more sixes?
What about these stars?
That's one gone.
Two.
Three.
Four... five... six.
They don't look much like stars now.
Look -- on the display! Globs of slime!
That can only mean one thing! 
The Problem Blob!
Uh-oh!
Blubbery
There he is!
BURBLES AND GRUNTS
We'll send Brain Gain to get the sixes back.
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
Bring back the sixes!
Bring back the sixes!
That's not how they were before.
BURBLES AND GRUNTS
That's not right.
They don't look much like stars. 
The six pointy bits are back.
But in the wrong places. There's two lots of three stuck together.
What about the stepladder? 
She wants to go up one step at a time.
That was three jumps of two!
BURBLES AND GRUNTS
That's the wrong arrangement of steps. 
And two jumps of three?!
What next?
One jump of six! 
It's still sixes.
But the six things have got to be arranged the right way.
If not, anything could happen.
If you shared a giant chocolate bar,
six lots of one,
the Blob would join it all up again.
And an ant with six legs might get blobbed.
And instead of two lots of three on each side,
it would have one lot of six on one side.
And shoelaces are hard enough to tie when holes are in the right place.
What if two lots of three became one lot of six?
That would be really hard to tie.
We've got to get these sixes sorted out the right way.
Yes!.. Oh, no!
How many children are there?
Three lots of two. That's six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Yes!
There's six of them. They might get blobbed.
BURBLES AND GRUNTS
Yeugh! 
Oh, no!
They're going to disappear!
We need Brain Gain to bring them back.
Bring back the six! Bring back the six!
They're back! 
But they're holding hands differently.
That's one lot of six.
What's going on?
That's not right! 
That's six ones.
And that's not right. 
That's two lots of three.
BLOB BURBLES AND GRUNTS
They had partners. They were three lots of two.
Get them back to the way they were -- three lots of two.
Three lots of two! Three lots of two!
Did the trick!
Now the paints -- we need two lots of three. 
Two lots of three!
That's it.
Sort the dice.
One lot of three.
Two lots of three.
Six!
Now sort the steps.
Six lots of one! Six lots of one!
That's it!
You've got to sort the Problem Blob out now, Six.
Let's see how good he is at jumping. 
Yeah!
Jumping six miles! Jumping six miles!
GRUNTS AND GROANS
One huge jump of six miles.
Right. I am coming back.
All clear for landing.
One, two, three, four, five, SIX!
We did it!
Great to see all those sixes.
And you can see them all on screen.
The six on the dice disappeared.
And the ladder with six steps.
Paint pots.
And the six points of the stars.
And the children -- three lots of two.
We got the six things back.
But they were the wrong arrangements.
Like the stars. 
And the stepladder.
And the children.
Finally sorted them out into the right arrangements.
And sent the Problem Blob on a six-mile jump!
And now a late entry in the Jumping Six Festival -- 
Zero!
I've got a feeling this isn't going to work.
Mmm. 
Now, Zero, you jump to six.
How many squares are you going to jump at a time? 
Zero.
Zero? 
Zero.
Oh, well, anyway...
Jumping zero squares at a time
how many jumps will Zero take to get to six?
One...
two...
three...
I think this might take a very long time. 
Four... five...
Why don't you keep your eyes open for things that come in sixes?
Things you can eat, things you can drink.
Anything. And call the Numberjacks.
I don't know what you mean, I can't keep quiet for two seconds!
What I mean is you're always talking.
You always say that.
Because you're always talking.
And this will prove you can't keep quiet.
WHOOSHING
Oops. What's that?
That is the Beeper.
Beep.
Hello, Beeper. 
Beep.
What does it do? 
It's a timer.
It will time how many beeps you can keep quiet for.
Loads of beeps. I could be quiet for ages and ages.
OK, what about ten beeps?
No problem.
Ooh, ten whole beeps of silence.
You're the one talking now!
Right, ten beeps starting... now!
One, two,
three, four...
five,
six,
seven, eight, nine...
SHE SHOUTS
I knew you couldn't do it. I knew it!
If the Beeper can time me being silent,
it could also time me being noisy!
Oh, no! 
One...
There we are! Argle bargle boo! I love making noise, don't you?
Noisy, noisy, noisy! Nooble wooble wooble!
ALARM RINGS
Oh, thank you, alarm, thank you.
I could've carried on. 
I know! Come on.
Beep.
ALARM CONTINUES
I could keep talking for ages.
Yes, yes.
Agent 38 here. Things are going wrong.
But not for long. 
Look at this.
On the screen.
WHIRRING
Look, he's doing up his shoe.
He hadn't finished doing his shoe up.
She didn't give him much time.
And look at this.
That wasn't enough time. 
We're on our way.
I'm up for it. 
Great! 
Thanks.
Number 5!
ALARM SOUNDS
ALARM STOPS
Checking it's clear for launching.
All clear. Stand by.
Five, four, three, two, one, zero!
Looking for a 5 to land on.
There's a good one.
WHOOSHING
OK, I'm here. I'll look for those children.
Wait, we've got another agent calling in.
Agent 54 here. We've got problems at the cafe.
'That looks nice.
'Oh, no!' 
What's going on?
The boy and his shoe. The girl and her coat.
The man and his food. What happened to them all?
Agent 79 here. Somebody stop them.
They didn't have enough time.
OK, now we need to find out who's doing this.
SHE CACKLES
And I think I'm beginning to guess. 
Spooky Spoon!
Putting the data on screen.
Oh, well, if it's not my numbery friend, 5.
I'm no friend of yours, Spooky Spoon.
Ooh, charmed, I'm sure.
Well, let me tell you, 5,
I'm having fun today.
I'm making sure nobody's got enough time to do anything!
Spooky Spoon makes you seem quiet.
People need time to do things properly.
Well, they're not going to get it, are they?
SHE CACKLES
'I didn't let her have enough time to get dressed.'
SPOOKY SPOON SNIGGERS
'Nor him!'
We've got to stop Spooky Spoon.
It's Agent 95 here. They all need more time to do things.
Getting the Brain Gain machine going.
HUMMING
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
BUZZING
Give them more time! Give them more time!
Give them more time! Give them more time!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
So, you want people to have more time.
Next.
'The waitress is taking too much time now.
'The food will be freezing by the time it gets there.'
SHE LAUGHS
We haven't stopped Spooky Spoon.
If people don't have enough time or have too much time,
anything could happen.
If there was never enough time to wash your face,
in the end you'd get so dirty,
plants might start growing on your face.
And if there was never enough time to get dressed,
you'd have to go out in your pyjamas.
And then, if Spooky Spoon gave you too much time outside,
you'd be out there for ages and ages
and get covered in snow.
We've got to stop that Spooky Spoon messing about with time.
You've got to find out exactly how much time things take.
If you time things, you know how long they take.
Of course! We can use my Beeper!
Do some timing! Do some timing!
5, can you find someone who Spooky Spoon hasn't messed up yet?
A woman over there looks OK.
'OK, let's time her drinking.'
Ready for timing.
'Here she goes. 
Start timing.'
One, two, three...
four, five.
Five beeps. 
OK, now we need to find someone dressing.
'That boy's doing his coat up.'
Starting timing.
'One, two, three...'
four, five,
six, seven, eight.
That's eight beeps for that boy doing his coat up.
Now we know how much time things take.
Well, time for me to have a bit more fun.
Oh, no, it isn't.
Get ready with Brain Gain.
I can make people take as much time as I want them to.
Like drinking.
Oh, no, you can't. 
The lady drinking takes five beeps.
Take too much time.
Take five beeps.
One,
two,
three,
four, five.
SHE SCREAMS
We've fixed the time things take.
No!
Hmm! I'll fix this child getting dressed.
Doing up coat -- eight beeps.
'One,
'two,
'three,
'four,
'five,
'six,
'seven, eight.'
SHE SHOUTS ANGRILY
We can time anything, Spooky Spoon,
and stop you messing it up.
Oh, can you?
Ha! Can you stop me messing you up?
Run for it, 5!
I'll catch you, 5!
Let's make you blink
for a very long time.
I can't see! 
She's near the edge!
She's going to fall! 
Make her fall take lots of time!
Lots of time! Lots of time!
Oh, no!
'One,
'two,
'three,
'four,
'five,
'six,
'seven,
'eight,
'nine,
'ten.' 
'Yeah!'
Taking lots of time, nice and slow!
Ooh! You Numberjacks think you're so clever.
We are, because we use our brains to think.
Well, think about this -
I am going to be around
for a very long time.
Not if we can help it. 
Set the Beeper to zero beeps.
Spooky Spoon's going to be around for no time at all.
No time at all. 
Zero time.
I am going to be around making trouble for... Ah!
For no time at all. 
Come back now, 5, well done.
Here I come!
All clear for landing.
ALL: 
One, two, three, four, five!
Well done, 5. 
I needed a lot of help.
A lot of thinking going on back here.
Now see it on screen.
Spooky was stopping people having the time to do things.
No time for eating.
Or for getting dressed.
We made Spooky give people more time.
But they had too much time. That's when the Beeper came in handy,
so we could say exactly how long things should take.
Spooky was after you.
I couldn't see. 
Lots of time to fall slowly.
No time at all for Spooky Spoon.
Now what I've done, 5, is set the Beeper to zero,
which means 3 can be noisy for no time at all.
I see. 
No time at all.
No time at all for being silent?
No, no time at all for being noisy.
I prefer no time for being silent.
So lots of time for being noisy!
Oh, no! 
Yes! Yargle bargle bingle bangle boo!
I love making noise! Don't you!
What can you find that shows how much time something takes?
Have a look for things and call the Numberjacks.
.. bingle bangle boo!
Right, the jump pad!
OK, I'm going first. 
Fine, you go ahead.
Watch this. Onto the jump pad, then onto the paper! Whoa!
Ahhhh.
It's not easy the first time you do it. 
I bet.
You CAN do an extra flip. 
No, thank you. 
Like this!
Yay!
Huh. Did the trick.
Hardly smudgy at all.
OK, Four, ready to go? 
Well, er... 
A Numberjack's got to do jumping.
Yes, well, there's jumping, and there's JUMPING.
You can do it, Four. 
You're right, I can.
Couldn't I just go and find a giant felt-tip pen?
You've got to make the mark yourself. 
OK. Here goes.
Yeah!
Pretty good for a first go.
It's more a splat than a four. 
Well, have another go.
Er... yeah, later. 
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on! 
Who's calling in?
Agent 79 here. Things are going wrong!
But not for long!
There's this girl, and her fridge magnets. 
I'm putting it on screen.
What's wrong with those?
They WERE fine, but look at the four!
That's a four?
Well, it was. Something's gone wrong with it. 
Oh, dear!
And look at these dice.
Four spots... gone!
Oh dear, oh dear!
What? 
Four, you're going out.
Thought so. All right, let's do it!
Number Four!
Checking the room is all clear. Need to clear the room.
Oh, me! Doorbell!
DOORBELL RINGS
All clear now!
Four! Three! Two! One! Zero!
Got to find a four...
Looking for fours...
Found a four.
Ooh. That was a bit uncomfortable. 
Sorry!
The best one I could find. 
There are problems with fours.
Oh, great(!)
It's Agent 83 here. There's a problem with the delivery.
OK, I'm onto it.
That parcel will never get delivered!
She doesn't know what house to deliver it to. 
Here we go!
It's Agent 95 here. There's a problem at the restaurant.
I'm onto it!
It's table four, but their table number's gone.
Now they'll never get served. 
They don't seem to mind!
OK, another job to do.
Oh, no. I can see what's causing all the trouble.
The slime!
The Problem Blob!
Urrgh! The Blob!
NOT what you want to see at a restaurant.
Information about him on screen now!
Oh, I think I've been hit!
So has the man, at exactly the same time!
What's happening? 
The slime has swapped them over!
He's Numberjack Man!
And Four thinks he's the man!
That lady's boyfriend!
He's going to try to be the table number!
He can't go round being a Numberjack!
Oh, no. What's he going to do next?
Agent 106 here!
We've got a problem!
This boy has got a birthday cake, but the number four is missing!
Can you send a Numberjack to... that was quick!
Numberjack Man is being the door number!
What's Numberjack Man going to do now?
Oh, no!
He's not very good at being a Numberjack!
And Four's not very good at being a person!
If Four carries on being a person, anything could happen!
For a start, Four wouldn't be very good at riding a bike.
He'd be good at SOME things in school...
Two and two... 
Four!
.. but he wouldn't be good at playing in the playground.
And what job could he get? A racing driver? Or a doctor?
Or a pop star? Not very likely!
Numberjack Man is going to get himself into more trouble!
That man lost the number four on his football shirt!
That lady's phone is missing a number!
What is it? 
It's four! 
Oh, no!
Nobody wants a great big Numberjack Man to be the number!
You can't really blame them.
He really wants to help people, but he can't be a number! He's too big!
Somebody's got to make some numbers to put things back to normal,
and Four can't!
He still thinks he's a person! 
It's got to be Numberjack Man!
Agents, any ideas how the Numberjack Man could make some numbers?
Maybe he could make a number with dots. 
Or maybe with lines.
Let's get Numberjack Man going!
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
Stop! We've an easy way! 
Make four dots!
Write four dots. Write four dots!
Four dots!
Try the dots on the man!
Great! How else can Numberjack Man write four?
Now he can do four lines!
Four lines!
They've got a new cake!
That's the cake sorted out.
The man wants lines, as well as spots.
Write it like number four.
Write the number four!
The man wants his shirt finished off!
Three different ways of writing four!
We've got to sort out our Four now!
He's not happy! 
We've got to swap them back!
Swap, swap!
Swap them back!
What's been going on?
Just got to sort the Blob.
Let's swap him, too. Swap him with something far away!
Hmm... something from where polar bears live. Swap! Swap!
What will it be?
A big lump of ice!
The Blob won't mess around with polar bears! 
Come back now, Four.
On my way.
All clear for landing.
One, two, three, four!
That was very weird.
But everything got sorted! Have a look.
All the fours were going wrong.
All disappearing.
That door number, and I was going to sort out the table number.
When the Blob swapped you with the man...
Ah! You were being a person!
And the man was being a Numberjack man!
He tried very hard to be a good Numberjack.
Looks like he wasn't very good at it.
Until we sent him some Brain Gain.
Sorted everything out! 
Including the Blob!
Here we go! 
Good luck!
Yeah!
Yes!
Now me!
Yay!
Wow, not bad!
It's another good way of showing three.
OK, Agents. Now try writing my number,
with dots, or lines or as a number.
Try it out, and call the Numberjacks.
OK. Two is going to do the jumping, jumping two squares at a time. 
Two.
Good luck, Two. 
Thank you. 
Try and jump on my number.
Two, four...
Hmph.
Six, eight...
Two, four, six, eight.
Jump back now. 
Perhaps he'll land on my number this time.
Eight, six, four, two, and back to the start.
Did it! Eight, six, four, two.
And where was three?
Three is a very good number to jump on!
Not when you're jumping in twos, it isn't.
It goes two, four, six, eight.
Your number's there, I noticed.
I can't help that.
Two, don't get me wrong, but I don't think you're trying hard enough.
All I'm asking is that you jump, just jippy-jippy-jump,
onto lovely number three.
Oooh, feels lovely.
You try it. 
He can't, if he's jumping in twos. 
He can try!
Oh! Go!
Two, four... 
Oh!
Sorry.
Six, eight... Come on, time to get over it.
Oh, OK then.
Bye, Two!
Come on, you two!
We've got an Agent that needs help! 
Who, who, who?
It's Agent 79 here. Things are going wrong.
But not for long!
It's a boy in his hovercraft.
Hold on, I'm putting it on screen.
That's cool.
Yes, but look what happened.
The number's gone!
And look at this dice.
There's one... 
And three...
And five!
But some of the numbers are missing.
Oh! Two, four and six!
Very strange. OK, Agent 79, we're sending someone out.
Thanks.
Two, four and six missing.
Shall I go, then? 
Six is going out!
Number Six!
Checking all clear for launch.
Don't mind us, Jasper. Apart from the cat, all clear!
Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Zero!
Looking for a six...
It's hard, not many sixes around.
Found one!
OK. Time to sort out these missing numbers.
Sounds like more problems!
Agent 54 here. There's a problem with a mobile phone.
On screen!
Six? Can you see what happened to her mobile phone? 
Checking now.
Some of the numbers seem to be missing. 
Which ones?
Two, four, six and eight. Sounds familiar.
Why those numbers?
Agent 57 here. They are the numbers you get if you count in twos. 
Two, then four, then six, then eight. 
At least three's safe!
But what's made them go missing?
I think that's the Numbertaker!
What do we know about him? 
Putting it on screen.
I'm after him!
Got a recording of how it happened.
Checking the car and dice.
He's up to his tricks! 
Let's hope Six finds him.
I've spotted the Numbertaker! 
What's he after now? 
Guess.
House numbers?
He's got two!
What will be next? 
I've got a terrible feeling...
I can't watch!
What number will be next?
Watch out, Six!
We've got to find a way of stopping him! He's moving on!
I should have guessed. Number eight. That's two, four, six, eight.
I think I'm going to need help.
I'll send for... Number Eight! 
Yeah!
If the Numbertaker starts mucking about with two, four, six and eight,
anything could happen.
Maybe he'd stop people using two hands.
Or he'd stop you being four years old.
You'd have to go straight from being three to being five!
And boxes wouldn't work, because they've got six sides.
And a spider couldn't use her eight legs.
She could only use seven legs.
That Numbertaker has got to be stopped!
Eight is on his way!
He's started on people now. Look at this man!
He can't use two legs! 
Poor man.
He has to hop!
I don't know why people find it so hard. 
But they do!
And there's more problems!
All these people are struggling with buggies.
Why? What is it about the buggies?
Agent 17 here. Count the wheels.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Great to see you, Eight! 
Great to be here.
Where's this silly old Numbertaker? 
Watch out, Eight.
Watch out!
OK. We need a plan. Any ideas?
It's all to do with two, four, six and eight.
If we keep counting two, four, six, eight,
things might get back to normal.
I'll go and get Two. 
I'll look after the screens.
OK. Everybody, get ready for Brain Gain.
Getting brain power now. Brain Gain!
Come on, Two. 
Ready, everyone?
Two, four, six, eight!
Two! 
Four! 
Six! 
Eight!
Two, four, six, eight!
Come on, Eight. 
Let's do it.
Two, four, six, eight!
Yeah! 
Yes!
And let's do it the other way!
Eight! 
Six!
Four! 
Two!
Did the trick!
Oh, look out!
Oh, no! 
Numbertaker, this way!
He can't decide who to go for!
Now he really can't decide!
Two legs. 
Four legs.
Or six. 
Or eight.
Make your mind up!
Serves you right, you meanie!
Come back now, Six, and bring Eight with you.
Let's go!
Number Three, checking the room is clear.
And it is!
One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!
We did it! 
Great working with you, Six.
And we've got it all on screen!
The toy and dice had lost their numbers.
That mean Numbertaker, taking two, four, six, and eight.
More numbers going! 
And people couldn't use two legs.
I needed Eight to help. 
Happy to!
Two, four, six, eight. Brain Gain sorted things out.
And the Numbertaker couldn't choose between two, four, six and eight!
And ended up very confused!
Now then, all together...
Two! 
Four! 
Six! 
Eight! We're the numbers who are great!
Well, that's all very nice for YOU...
Don't worry, Three. 
We're here, too.
Ready? 
One. 
And three. 
Five. 
Seven. 
And nine.
We're the numbers who are fine. Hurray!
Oh. Who does Zero join in with?
Two, four, six, eight? 
Or one, three, five, seven and nine?
You decide the best group for Zero to join in, and call the Numberjacks!
Now, this isn't easy, One, but you might as well have a go.
You jump on to the jump pad, and then onto the paper to make a one.
Mmmm, yeah.
Oh, dear. Still, I said it wasn't easy.
Oh, do you want a go?
Well, why not? Your buddy block is going to have a go. 
Oooh.
Excellent.
I knew it. My buddy blocks want a go, now.
All right, then. Get together...
Go for it!
Yeah!
That looks good.
Making big squares, and little squares.
Yes, we've got some very clever buddy blocks here.
More buddy blocks want to join in.
Will they make a square, too? 
Just watch them.
That's it! And, go!
Yeah! Another great square!
One, four and nine.
Numbers who make squares... 
.. with our buddy blocks.
Got to go. Might be off on a mission.
Never mind, One.
Maybe I'll take you out somewhere, later.
Come on, Four. What have you been doing? 
Making squares.
Agent 22's calling in!
Things are going wrong!
But not for long!
On the screen.
He LOOKS all right.
But look what happens!
He's starting to dance!
Wow!
Is he going to risk it again?
I wouldn't want to be dancing like that.
Can you send someone? 
Definitely!
Dear, dear! 
Four looks keen on dancing. 
I am not!
Excellent! Four's going out! 
Thanks!
Number Four! 
Checking the room's clear...
All clear!
Four! Three! Two! One! Zero!
Finding a four...
A four...
Found a four!
I'm here!
Good! Cos there's more problems!
Agent 41 here. Look at this!
Oh, no!
Everybody's dancing! They can't stop themselves!
It's Agent 79 here. Look what the children are playing on.
It's Agent 95 here.
They're on squares, just like the boy on the mat!
Are we sure they're squares? 
Looking at them...
Yes! It's a square!
What about the other children?
Squares again!
Maybe it's the squares.
The squares are making them dance. 
It's square dancing!
OK, but you have to ask -- why?
Four... 
I mean, what sort of strange...
Four! 
.. would take a harmless shape like a square, and...
ALL: FOUR! 
What?
Behind you!
Aaagh! The Shape Japer! 
Here's what we know about the Shape Japer.
Looks like the Shape Japer's back.
We're... DANCING!
The Shape Japer is using squares to make people dance!
Even if they don't want to!
She's looking for more people, to make them dance!
She'll be all right. She's not near a square.
Square dancing!
She's certainly dancing!
How come the lady started dancing?
She's got squares on her top.
First, it was people who were on squares.
Now it's squares that are on people.
Oh, no! Anyone with squares on them might be made to dance,
when they don't want to!
Four! Check that man!
He seems all right.
Just some diamond patterns on his tie.
Square dancing!
He won't be dancing!
Oh no!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I thought it was diamonds, but...
These diamonds are squares that have been tipped over a bit.
It looks like anything to do with squares
could get people square dancing!
If you had a diamond on your T-shirt,
it could be a tipped-over square, so you'd be square dancing!
And if your bath was on square tiles,
your bath might start square dancing, and throw the water out!
And if your house had squares on it, like square windows,
your whole house might start square dancing, and throw EVERYTHING out!
We've got to stop that Shape Japer!
There she is! 
Oh no! 
Square dancing! Ha ha ha ha ha! 
Oh no!
Hey! No! How come I'm dancing? Woah! There are no squares on me!
Why is Four dancing? 
What's Four got to do with squares?
It's because four things can make a square.
Like Four's buddy blocks made a square.
Yes, got it on screen! Four buddy blocks make a square!
You're a square sort of number, Four!
Which is fine, except when I'm made to do square dancing!
SHE LAUGHS
Square dancing! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh no! Who's going to help Four?
Look! Nine's out there, taking One for a trip!
Lucky she was. Nine! Can you help Four?
I'll certainly try.
The Shape Japer's making square numbers do square dancing!
Phew. 
Hmmm. 
Hey! Nine!
You two had better watch out.
Your buddy blocks made squares too, remember? 
Got it on screen.
Use Brain Gain to make safe squares.
One and Nine can make safe squares.
Sounds good to me! 
We'll need some Brain Gain.
I can do it!
We'll make squares that everyone can be safe in!
Getting Brain Power now. Brain Gain!
I'm thinking squares! Squares! Squares!
Safe squares, safe squares.
Ooh. 
You can do it, One.
Make a safe square.
That's a safe square, so the boy can stop dancing.
Square dancing!
Square safe.
Quick! We need a bigger one for the man and the woman! 
I'll do it!
Sending Brain Gain!
One, two, three, four little squares...
.. make one big square!
THEY SIGH IN RELIEF
Square dancing!
Square safe!
SHE HISSES
Need a big safe square for all these kids.
I can do it! Safe square! Safe square! Safe square!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine little squares...
.. make one big safe square!
Square dancing!
Square safe! 
We're all inside the safe squares.
We've won.
Square dancing! Square dancing!
The Shape Japer's not happy. 
Square dancing!
SHE SCREAMS
Did it! 
Come back now, One, Four and Nine.
Three famous square numbers.
All clear for landing!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!
Well done, everyone! 
Check it all out on screen.
The boy on the square mat got dancing.
And the children on the hopscotch squares.
The lady had a square on her blouse. 
The man had diamonds on his tie. Diamonds are squares.
That Shape Japer, up to her tricks.
She got me dancing. Oh, no.
And Nine and One helped Four make safe squares.
One small square for the boy.
Four small squares make a big one.
And nine squares make a big square, for all the children.
Goodbye for now, Shape Japer. Yee-ha!
Now, can our buddy blocks make an even bigger square?
I don't think so. 
And one's joining in...
No. We need some more buddy blocks to finish that square.
So, how many buddy blocks will we need all together to make a bigger square? Find out, and call the Numberjacks.
