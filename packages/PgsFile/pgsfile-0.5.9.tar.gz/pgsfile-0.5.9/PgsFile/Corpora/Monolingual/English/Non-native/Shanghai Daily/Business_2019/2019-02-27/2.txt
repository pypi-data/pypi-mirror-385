Fair expands to develop nation’s trade 
2019-02-27
This year’s East China Import and Export Commodity Fair, which kicks off on Friday, will see a new matchmaking session for companies in Belt and Road countries in addition to the three conducted at last year’s event.
The fair, the 29th and which runs until Monday, has attracted over 4,000 companies, including more than 500 overseas enterprises; will cover 126,500 square meters, an increase of 2,900 square meters from last year; and boast 5,868 standard booths, organizers said in a statement yesterday.
“The East China Fair has always been committed to the development of China’s import and export trade platform and to actively promoting the development of China’s foreign trade,” said Shi Chen, deputy director of the Trade Development Office of the Shanghai Commerce Commission.
The consumer goods sector will set up 1,185 booths, 76 more than last year, indicating China’s consumer goods sector continues to develop amid strong competitive pressure in global markets, organizers said.
The Belt and Road matchmaking session is in addition to the three held last year — on Europe and America, textiles and clothing, and Japan — which will also be held this year.
Amid a complex external environment and increasing uncertainties in the global economy, the ECF has buckled down to provide a better environment for exhibitors and help companies develop.
