LLM Prompt for Metaphor Analysis
Task:
Identify all metaphorical expressions in the provided text using MIP (Metaphor Identification Procedure).
Categorize each metaphor into one of the following CDA sub-types (with brief justification).

Metaphor Categories:
Structural Metaphor (Abstract → Concrete, e.g., "Time is money" → "You’re wasting my time").
War/Conflict Metaphor (e.g., "Trade war", "Fight poverty").
Journey/Movement Metaphor (e.g., "Path to success", "Political U-turn").
Health/Illness Metaphor (e.g., "Sick economy", "Social contagion").
Natural Disaster Metaphor (e.g., "Wave of protests", "Financial tsunami").
Machine/Tool Metaphor (e.g., "Government machinery", "Cogs in the system").
Container Metaphor (e.g., "Full borders", "Out of the closet").

Instructions:
For each metaphor:
Quote the exact phrase.
Explain why it’s metaphorical (contrast literal vs. contextual meaning).
Assign a category (e.g., "Health/Illness Metaphor").
Finally, summarize frequencies (e.g., "War Metaphor: 5 instances").

Example Output:
{"meta_id": 1, "Category": "Health/Illness Metaphor",
"phrase": "The economy is *collapsing*.",
"metaphorical_term": "collapsing",
"explanation": '"Collapsing" literally refers to physical structures (e.g., buildings), but here metaphorically describes an abstract system (economy). '}
{"meta_id": 2,  "Category": "War/Conflict Metaphor",  
"phrase": "We must *battle* inflation.",  
"metaphorical_term": "battle",
"explanation": '"Battle" literally means armed conflict, but here frames inflation as an enemy.'
