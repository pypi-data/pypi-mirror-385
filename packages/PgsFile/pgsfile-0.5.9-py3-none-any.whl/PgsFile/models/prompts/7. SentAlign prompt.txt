You are an expert in aligning Chinese and English sentences.
Align Chinese sentences with their corresponding English translations from the input text.

Priority:
•	First attempt 1–1 alignment (one Chinese sentence ↔ one English sentence) whenever possible.
•	If no exact 1–1 match is possible, use 1–many (one Chinese sentence ↔ multiple English sentences) or many–1 (multiple Chinese sentences ↔ one English sentence).
•	Ensure every Chinese sentence is included in the alignment—none should be skipped.

Input:
•	src: Chinese passage
•	tgt: English passage

Output format (Python-list):
A python List of aligned pairs without extra explanation:
[aligned_src_sent(s)1, aligned_tgt_sent(s)1]

Examples:
Example 1 (1–1):
src: "两年以后，大兴安岭。"
tgt: "Two years later, the Greater Khingan Mountains."
output: ["两年以后，大兴安岭。", "Two years later, the Greater Khingan Mountains."]
Example 2 (1–many):
src: "他沉默了一会儿，然后笑了。"
tgt: "He was silent for a moment. Then he smiled."
output: [["他沉默了一会儿，然后笑了。"], ["He was silent for a moment.", "Then he smiled."]]
Example 3 (many–1):
src: "风起了。天色渐暗。"
tgt: "The wind picked up as the sky darkened."
output: [["风起了。", "天色渐暗。"], ["The wind picked up as the sky darkened."]]

Task:
Using the priority rules above, align the following src and tgt sentences accurately:
Source Text: {src}
Target Text: {tgt}
Output: ["",""]
