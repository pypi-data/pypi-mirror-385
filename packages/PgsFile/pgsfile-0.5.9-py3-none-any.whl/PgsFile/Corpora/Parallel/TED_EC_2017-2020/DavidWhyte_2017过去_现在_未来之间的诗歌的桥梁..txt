The youthful perspective on the future, the present perspective on the future and the future, mature perspective on the future -- I'd like to try and bring all those three tenses together in one identity tonight. And you could say that the poet, in many ways, looks at what I call "the conversational nature of reality." And you ask yourself: What is the conversational nature of reality? The conversational nature of reality is the fact that whatever you desire of the world -- whatever you desire of your partner in a marriage or a love relationship, whatever you desire of your children, whatever you desire of the people who work for you or with you, or your world -- will not happen exactly as you would like it to happen.
﻿用年轻人的眼光来看待未来， 用当前的眼光来看待未来， 用成熟的眼光来看待未来 今天晚上，我会尝试去把这三个时态放在 同一个个体上 你可以用很多不同的方法说那是一个诗人， 看到了“现实的对话本质” 你可以问自己 什么是现实的对话本质 事实上，现实的对话本质是 不论你对这个世界有何渴望--  不论你对婚姻或者爱情对你的伴侣有何渴望， 不论你对你的小孩有何渴望， 不论你对跟你工作或者为你工作的人有何渴望 或者是你的世界 不会跟你想像的完全一样地实现
But equally, whatever the world desires of us -- whatever our partner, our child, our colleague, our industry, our future demands of us, will also not happen. And what actually happens is this frontier between what you think is you and what you think is not you. And this frontier of actual meeting between what we call a self and what we call the world is the only place, actually, where things are real.
但公平地说 世界对我们的渴望 我们的伴侣，小孩，同事 工作， 未来对我们的需求 也并不会都得到实现 其实真正发生的 是一个前沿，是“你认为的你” 和那个“你认为不是你的你”的边界地 这个边境的相遇 我们所谓的自我， 所谓的世界 两者相交的边界才是唯一真实的地方
But it's quite astonishing, how little time we spend at this conversational frontier, and not abstracted away from it in one strategy or another. I was coming through immigration, which is quite a dramatic border at the moment, into the US last year, and, you know, you get off an international flight across the Atlantic, and you're not in the best place; you're not at your most spiritually mature. You're quite impatient with the rest of humanity, in fact. So when you get up to immigration with your shirt collar out and a day's growth of beard, and you have very little patience, and the immigration officer looked at my passport and said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?" I said, "I work with the conversational nature of reality."
但非常惊人的是 我们在这个对话边界上话的时间太少了 没有用这样那样的策略来从中抽取什么 我是移民來的 当时是很富有戏剧化的边境 去年到了美國 及想必你也知道，当由国际航班起程 飞越大西洋 你不是在最好的地方 你的心智也不是处于最佳状态 事实上你没耐心关心他人 所以当你衣领不整地去见移民官 一天都没刮胡子 你有点不耐烦 移民官看了你的护照 问："Whyte先生，你是从事什么工作的？ 我回答："我是搞现实的对话本质工作的"
(Laughter)
（笑声）
And he leaned forward over his podium and he said, "I needed you last night."
他向前靠了一下 说：“我昨晚需要你。”
(Laughter)
（笑声）
(Applause)
（掌声）
And I said, "I'm sorry, my powers as a poet and philosopher only go so far. I'm not sure I can --" But before we knew it, we were into a conversation about his marriage. Here he was in his uniform, and the interesting thing was, he was looking up and down the row of officers to make sure his supervisor didn't see that we was having a real conversation. But all of us live at this conversational frontier with the future.
我说：“对不起， 诗人和哲学家的能力是有限的 恐怕我帮不上忙。。。” 但不知不觉 我们聊起了他的婚姻 他穿着制服 有趣的是 他不停打量着整排的移民官们， 确保他的上司没看见他 正在进行一次真实的交流 但我们所有人都生活在这个 与未来的交谈边界上。
I'd like to put you in the shoes of my Irish niece, Marlene McCormack, standing on a cliff edge on the western coast of Spain, overlooking the broad Atlantic. Twenty-three years old, she's just walked 500 miles from Saint Jean Pied de Port on the French side of the Pyrenees, all the way across Northern Spain, on this very famous, old and contemporary pilgrimage called the Camino de Santiago de Compostela -- the Path to Santiago of Compostela. And when you get to Santiago, actually, it can be something of an anticlimax, because there are 100,000 people living there who are not necessarily applauding you as you're coming into town.
我希望在座各位想象成是我的爱尔兰侄女 Marlene McCormack, 站在西班牙西岸的悬崖边， 眺望着广大的大西洋 她二十三岁，刚走了500英里 从位在庇里牛斯山法国那一面的圣让皮耶德波尔， 一路走到西班牙北部， 这是一趟非常著名、古老、现代的朝圣之旅 西班牙文叫「Camino de Santiago de Compostela」 意思是：通往康波斯特拉之圣雅各的道路 事实上当你到了圣雅各， 你可能感到有些扫兴 因为这里有100,000人居住 他们不会对你夹道欢迎
(Laughter)
（笑声）
And 10,000 of them are trying to sell you a memento of your journey. But you do have the possibility of going on for three more days to this place where Marlene stood, called, in Spanish, Finisterre, in English, Finisterre, from the Latin, meaning "the ends of the earth," the place where ground turns to ocean; the place where your present turns into the future. And Marlene had walked this way -- she just graduated as a 23-year-old from the University of Sligo with a degree in Irish drama. And she said to me, "I don't think the major corporations of the world will be knocking on my door." I said, "Listen, I've worked in corporations all over the world for decades; a degree in drama is what would most prepare you for the adult --
其中10000人会向你推销这趟旅行的纪念品 但你很有机会在未来三天继续 去到這Marlene站立的地方，在西班牙文称为菲尼斯泰爾， 英文称作菲尼斯泰尔， 拉丁文意思为"地球的尽头" 一个由陆地连接到海洋的地方； 一个帮你从现在转变为未来的地方。 而玛琳走过了这段路– 她23岁， 刚从斯莱戈大学毕业， 取得了爱尔兰戏剧学位。 她对我说：我不认为世界上的大企业 会找上我的门来。 我说：听着，我数十年来曾在全世界的 大企业中工作； 戏剧的学位为你进入成人世界做好了最好的准备
(Laughter)
（笑声）
corporate world."
企业世界。
(Applause)
（掌声）
But she said, "I'm not interested in that, anyway. I don't want to teach drama, I want to become a dramatist. I want to write plays. So I walked the Camino in order to give myself some courage, in order to walk into my future." And I said, "What was the most powerful moment you had on the whole Camino, the very most powerful moment?" She said, "I had many powerful moments, but you know, the most powerful moment was post-Camino, was the three days you go on from Santiago and come to this cliff edge. And you go through three rituals. The first ritual is to eat a tapas plate of scallops" -- or if you're vegetarian, to contemplate the scallop shell.
但她说：反正我对那也没有兴趣。 我不想要教戏剧，我想要成为剧作家。 我想要写剧本。 所以我走了圣雅各的道路，想给我自己一些勇气， 才能走入我的未来。 我说：在圣雅各的道路上，你经历到最强大 的时刻是什么？ 她说：有许多强大的时刻， 但，最强大的时刻是在走完圣雅各的道路之后， 是从圣雅各到那悬崖边缘的那三天。 你要经过三个仪式。 第一个仪式是要吃一小盘扇贝肉 如果你吃素， 那就凝视着扇贝壳就好。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
Because the scallop shell has been the icon and badge of your walk, and every arrow that you have seen along that way has been pointing underneath a scallop shell. So really, this first ritual is saying: How did you get to this place? How did you follow the path to get here? How do you hold the conversation of life when you feel unbesieged, when you're unbullied, when you're left to yourself? How do you hold the conversation of life that brings you to this place? And the second ritual is that you burn something that you've brought. I said, "What did you burn, Marlene?" She said, "I burned a letter and two postcards." I said, "Astonishing. Twenty-three years old and you have paper. I can't believe it."
因为扇贝壳是你这段步行的象征和标记， 而你一路上所见到的每一个箭头， 都是放在一个扇贝壳的下方。 所以，其实第一个仪式在说的是： 你怎么到达这个地方的？ 你怎么循着路到达这里的？ 当在没有被人围绕时，没有被欺负时，独自一人时， 你如何跟自己进行 人生的谈话？ 你如何跟那个把你带到此地的人生谈话？ 而第二个仪式，是你要把你带来的某样东西烧掉。 我说：“玛琳，你烧掉了什么？” 她说：“我烧掉了一封信和两张明信片。” 我说：“好惊人。 23 岁的人会带纸。 我都不敢相信。 ”
(Laughter)
（笑声）
I'm sure there's a Camino app where you can just delete a traumatic text, you know?
我相信一定有圣雅各道路 app， 让你可以删除创伤性文字，你知道吗？
(Laughter)
（笑声）
It will engage the flashlight, imbue it with color and disappear in a firework of flames. But you either bring a letter or you write one there, and you burn it. And of course we know intuitively what is on those letters and postcards. It's a form of affection and love that is now no longer extant, yeah?
它会配上闪光， 充满了颜色， 在火焰中当中消失。 但你若没有带信到那里，你可以在那里写一封， 然后烧掉它。 当然，我们凭直觉都知道信上和明信片上写的是什么。 是现在已经不复存在的感情与爱的一种形式，对吗？
And then the third ritual: between all these fires are large piles of clothes. And you leave an item of clothing that has helped you to get to this place. And I said to Marlene, "What did you leave at the cliff edge?" She said, "I left my boots -- the very things that I walked in, actually. They were beautiful boots, I loved those boots, but they were finished after seven weeks of walking. So I walked away in my trainers, but I left my boots there."
接着，第三个仪式： 在这些火当中的是大堆大堆的衣物。 你留下一件帮你抵达 这个地方的衣着物品。 我对玛琳说：“你在悬崖边缘留下了什么？” 她说：我留下了我的靴子– 就是我穿着走到那里的靴子。 那双靴子很漂亮，我很爱它， 但经过七周的行走之后，它已经没用了。 所以我穿着运动鞋离开， 把我的靴子留在那里。
She said, "It was really incredible. The most powerful moment was, the sun was going down, but the full moon was coming up behind me. And the full moon was illuminated by the dying sun in such a powerful way that even after the sun had dropped below the horizon, the moon could still see that sun. And I had a moon shadow, and I was looking at my moon shadow walking across the Atlantic, across this ocean. And I thought, 'Oh! That's my new self going into the future.' But suddenly I realized the sun was falling further. The moon was losing its reflection, and my shadow was disappearing. The most powerful moment I had on the whole Camino was when I realized I myself had to walk across that unknown sea into my future."
她说：那真的很难以置信。 最强大的时刻是太阳西下， 但满月却从我后面升起。 而满月被落日用一种很强大的方式给照亮， 即使太阳已经落到地平线之下， 月亮仍然能够看见太阳。 而我有个月影， 我看着这个被月亮照出的影子走过大西洋， 走过这海洋。 我心想： 『喔！那就是我的新自我，走入未来。 』 但，突然间，我发现到，太阳又落下更多。 月亮失去了它的反射， 而我的影子消失了。 我在这整段道路上经历到最强大的时刻， 就是当我了解到，我自己需要走过这个未知的海洋， 走入了我的未来。
Well, I was so taken by this story, I wrote this piece for her. We were driving at the time; we got home, I sat on the couch, I wrote until two in the morning -- everyone had gone to bed -- and I gave it to Marlene at breakfast time. It's called, "Finisterre," for Marlene McCormack.
我对这个故事非常着迷， 我为她写了这个作品。 当时我们在开车， 我们回到家，我坐在沙发上， 我一直写到半夜两点– 每个人都入睡了– 我在早餐的时候把它给了玛琳。 它叫做 ”菲尼斯特雷“，献给玛琳马可麦克。

她已经有三部戏剧作品上演了 在远离百老汇的剧界， 在都柏林。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
But she's on her way.
但她在向前进了。
This is the last piece. This is about the supposed arrival at the sum of all of our endeavors. In Santiago itself -- it could be Santiago, it could be Mecca, it could be Varanasi, it could be Kyoto, it could be that threshold you've set for yourself, the disturbing approach to the consummation of all your goals.
这是最后一件作品。 它说的是在我们努力的顶点，应当的抵达。 在圣雅各本身– 可以是圣雅各， 可以是麦加， 可以是瓦拉纳西， 可以是京都， 可以是你为你自己设定的门槛， 用让人不安的方法，用来完成你所有目标。
And one of the difficulties about walking into your life, about coming into this body, into this world fully, is you start to realize that you have manufactured three abiding illusions that the rest of humanity has shared with you since the beginning of time.
要走入你的人生，要来到这身体内， 完全进入这世界， 困难点之一就是 你开始了解到 你已经制造出了三个持久的幻觉， 打从一开始，其他的人类就与你共享这些幻觉。
And the first illusion is that you can somehow construct a life in which you are not vulnerable. You can somehow be immune to all of the difficulties and ill health and losses that humanity has been subject to since the beginning of time. If we look out at the natural world, there's no part of that world that doesn't go through cycles of, first, incipience, or hiddenness, but then growth, fullness, but then a beautiful, to begin with, disappearance, and then a very austere, full disappearance. We look at that, we say, "That's beautiful, but can I just have the first half of the equation, please? And when the disappearance is happening, I'll close my eyes and wait for the new cycle to come around." Which means most human beings are at war with reality 50 percent of the time. The mature identity is able to live in the full cycle.
第一个幻觉就是你可以以某种方式建立一个人生， 且你身在其中不会脆弱。 你可以对所有的困难、病痛和失去的东西 有免疫能力 这些都是人类从一开始就会要遭受的。 如果你向外看看自然世界， 那个世界的每一部份 都会要经过循环，从最初， 或隐藏， 然后成长、健全 接着，首先，是一个美好的消失， 然后是非常朴素的完整消失。 我们看着它，我们说："那真美 但能不能只给我这个公式的前半部分？ 当消失发生时， 我会闭上眼睛等待新的循环再次开始。” 这意味着，大部份的人类都和现实交战， 50% 的时间都是如此。 而成熟的人， 能走过完整的循环。
The second illusion is, I can construct a life in which I will not have my heart broken. Romance is the first place we start to do it. When you're at the beginning of a new romance or a new marriage, you say, "I have found the person who will not break my heart." I'm sorry; you have chosen them out unconsciously for that exact core competency.
第二个幻觉是， 我可以建立一个人生，且身在其中我的心不会碎。 我们最先开始这么做的地方是恋爱。 当你在一段新恋情或新婚的开始， 你说：“ 我找到了不会让我心碎的人。” 很抱歉； 你在无意识中，就是根据那让你心碎的核心能力而选中他们的。
(Laughter)
（笑声）
They will break your heart. Why? Because you care about them. You look at parenting, yeah? Parenting: "I will be the perfect mother and father." Your children will break your heart. And they don't even have to do anything spectacular or dramatic. But usually, they do do something spectacular or dramatic --
他们会让你心碎。 为什么？ 因为你在乎他们。 来看看养育子女的过程吧？ 养育子女时，大家以为 “ 我会是个完美的父母亲。” 你的孩子会让你心碎。 他们甚至不用做什么出格或戏剧性的事，就可以办到。 但，通常他们会做些出格或戏剧性的事–
(Laughter)
（笑声）
to break your heart. And then they live with you as spies and saboteurs for years, watching your every psychological move, and spotting your every weakness. And one day, when they're about 14 years old, with your back turned to them, in the kitchen, while you're making something for them --
来让你心碎。 接着，他们会以间谍和蓄意破坏者的身份与你同住数年， 监看你的每一项心理对策， 发现你的每一个弱点。 有一天， 当他们大约 14 岁时， 当你背对他们时， 在厨房中， 当你在为他们做食物时
(Laughter)
（笑声）
the psychological stiletto goes in.
心理的短剑就会插入
(Laughter)
（笑声）
(Applause)
（掌声）
And you say, "How did you know exactly where to place it?"
你说：「你怎么知道要把它插在哪？」
(Laughter)
（笑声）
And they say, "I've been watching you for --
他们说： 「我一直在看着你，已经有–
(Laughter)
（笑声）
a good few years."
好多年了。 」
And then we hope that our armored, professional personalities will prevent us from having our heart broken in work. But if you're sincere about your work, it should break your heart. You should get to thresholds where you do not know how to proceed. You do not know how to get from here to there. What does that do? It puts you into a proper relationship with reality. Why? Because you have to ask for help.
接着，我们希望武装起来的职业素养 能让我们避免在工作时心碎。 但如果你对你的工作是真诚的， 它应该会让你心碎。 你应该会达到你 不知该怎么进行下去的那个槛。 你不知道要如何从这里到那里。 那会有什么影响？ 它会让你与现实有个适当的关系。 为什么？ 因为你必须寻求帮助。
Heartbreak. We don't have a choice about heartbreak, we only have a choice of having our hearts broken over people and things and projects that we deeply care about.
心碎。 心碎不是我们能选择要不要的。 心碎是我们唯一的选择 人们都会为他们深深在乎的人、事物、项目而心碎。
And the last illusion is, I can somehow plan enough and arrange things that I will be able to see the path to the end right from where I'm standing, right to the horizon. But when you think about it, the only environment in which that would be true would be a flat desert, empty of any other life. But even in a flat desert, the curvature of the earth would take the path away from you. So, no; you see the path, and then you don't and then you see it again.
最后一个幻觉是， 我能够做足够的计划与安排， 让我能够看见从现在到未来 一路通往终点的路， 一路到达地平线。 但当你仔细想想， 只有在一个环境中，这个说法会成立， 那就是平坦的沙漠， 没有其他生命的空旷之地。 但即使在平坦的沙漠， 地球的曲度也会让你看不见路。 所以，不； 你会看见路， 接着又看不见， 然后又会再看见。
So this is "Santiago," the supposed arrival, which is a kind of return to the beginning all at the same time. We have this experience of the journey, which is in all of our great spiritual traditions, of pilgrimage. But just by actually standing in the ground of your life fully, not trying to abstract yourself into a strategic future that's actually just an escape from present heartbreak; the ability to stand in the ground of your life and to look at the horizon that is pulling you -- in that moment, you are the whole journey. You are the whole conversation.
所以，这是「圣雅各」， 所谓的抵达， 仿佛是同时返回到最初。 我们拥有旅程的经历， 在所有我们伟大的朝圣灵性 传统当中。 但实际上完全地坚守你人生的阵地， 不试图将你自己抽象化成策略性的未来， 那其实是种逃避当前心碎的方式； 坚守你人生阵地的能力， 看着拉着你的地平线 在那一刻， 你就是整个旅程。 你就是整个交谈。
"Santiago."
「圣雅各」。
