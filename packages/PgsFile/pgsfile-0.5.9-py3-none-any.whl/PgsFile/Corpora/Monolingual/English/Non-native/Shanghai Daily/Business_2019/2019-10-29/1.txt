2019-10-29
SLOVAKIAN company Klein Vision is to display a flying car at the China International Import Expo.
Its AirCar arrived at Pudong International Airport yesterday morning. It came from Vienna, Austria via Incheon, South Korea. 
With wings on both sides, the flying car can change from vehicle mode to flying mode in a short time.
More details of the AirCar, a functional prototype, will be released when the expo opens on November 5, it said. 
Slovakia currently has five successful sport aircraft manufacturers, including Klein Vision.
Another Slovak firm AeroMobil exhibited a flying car at the first import expo last year.
