2019-02-14
Alibaba’s logistics arm, Cainiao Network, said it has signed a letter of intent to strengthen collaboration with Russian Post to boost cross-border trade in a bid to bolster Chinese exports.
The two parties will build and upgrade the infrastructure of full-service centers in Russia, providing services for warehousing, orders, parcel-handling, sorting and courier delivery, and also increasing capacity during peak times.
“Combining our two parties’ experience will improve the quality, cost-efficiency and speed of delivery of goods from China to Russia immensely,” said Nikolai Podguzov, general director of Russian Post.
“We intend to become a key logistics partner with Cainiao in Russia.”
Lin Wan, president of Cainiao Network, said: “Cainiao is committed to developing a global smart logistics network with a partnership approach, and we are delighted to join hands with Russian Post to help our merchants better serve Russian and global consumers.”
The tie-up would boost cross-border logistics and also provide vendors on Alibaba’s overseas-buyer targeted site AliExpress with its warehouse and delivery services.
