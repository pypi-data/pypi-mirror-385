In terms of assets, at the end of 2018, the total assets of legal entities engaged in the secondary and tertiary industries were 914.2 trillion yuan. These two industries employed 383.236 million people in the legal entities, an increase of 7.6 percent compared with that of the end of 2013. The secondary industry saw a drop of 10.4 percent in employment while the tertiary industries saw a jump of 28.9 percent employment. About 149.3 million people work in self-employed units.
