2019-02-14
Another three prototypes of the C919, Chinaâ€™s first domestically developed narrow-body passenger jet, will undergo test flights this year, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) says.
The No. 104 C919 is being assembled at the COMAC assembly line in Shanghai, while major parts for the No. 105 and No. 106 are being manufactured.
They will carry out maiden flights from Pudong International Airport by the end of the year, making the total number of prototypes six. All six will be used to acquire an airworthiness certificate.
The No. 102 and No. 103 C919s are being refitted at the assembly line following previous test flights. Further tests will be carried out on the two prototypes after the three-month refitting.
The first C919 made its maiden flight from Shanghai on May 5, 2017.
