2019-01-14
Hong Kong International Airport witnessed continuous traffic growth in 2018, with the volume of passengers and cargo throughput growing 2.5 percent and 1.5 percent respectively, said Airport Authority Hong Kong yesterday.
According to the airport authority, three air traffic categories reached new annual heights. During last year, HKIA handled 74.7 million passengers and 5.1 million tons of overall cargo throughput. Flight movements reached 427,725, with an increase of 1.7 percent.
Amid the uncertain global economic situation, Hong Kong flight movements and passenger volume experienced steady growth, benefiting from growth in visitor traffic to Hong Kong.
Data from Hong Kong’s Tourism Board showed that total visitor arrivals from January to November last year reached 58.56 million, up 10 percent over the same period in 2017. 
The airport would continue to launch new initiatives, including the upcoming Terminal 1 Annex Building, to cater for the surging demand and therefore to solidify HKIA’s leading position as a regional and international aviation hub, said authority CEO Fred Lam. 
As a major infrastructure, Hong Kong airport connected over 220 destinations.
