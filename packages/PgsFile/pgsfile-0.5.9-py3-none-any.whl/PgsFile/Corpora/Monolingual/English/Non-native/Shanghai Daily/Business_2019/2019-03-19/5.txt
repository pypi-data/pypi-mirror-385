Board open for sci-tech applications 
2019-03-19
The Shanghai Stock Exchange started accepting listing applications for its new science and technology innovation board yesterday.
Yantai Raytron Technology Co, a Chinese developer of imaging and sensor technology, has already completed pre-listing tutoring from CITIC Securities, while several other technology companies, including Venus Medtech (Hangzhou) Inc and Xinguang Photoelectric Technology Co, are receiving tutoring from underwriters, according to regulatory filings.
The exchange’s review process takes three to six months, which means the first batch of applicants could debut on the board as early as June.
The entire application process can be done online on the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s official website, which also has information about regulations and requirements.
The exchange will decide on applications within five working days. Upon approval, companies can then post a prospectus on the site.
