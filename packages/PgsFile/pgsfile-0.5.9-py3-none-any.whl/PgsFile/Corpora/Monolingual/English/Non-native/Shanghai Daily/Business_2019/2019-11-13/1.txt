2019-11-13
Shanghai is playing a leading role in research and development in the Yangtze River Delta region, with foreign-invested companies major contributors, according to a report.
“Shanghai is the core in R&D cooperation in the YRD region, while cities near Shanghai show strong collaborative innovation capability,” according to a report released at a forum hosted by the Shanghai Association of Foreign Investment yesterday.
“G60 Science and Technology Corridor is an important carrier and Nanjing is the best in radiation effect, which drives the rapid rise of scientific research in central Jiangsu Province,” the Yangtze River Delta Foreign-Invested Enterprise Sci-Tech Innovation report said.
There are six provinces and cities on the Chinese mainland with an R&D investment of more than 100 billion yuan (US$14.27 billion) in 2018, including three in the YRD region — Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
Chen Deming, chairman of the China Association of Foreign Investment, said foreign companies were important in this round of scientific and technological innovation.
“Foreign investors are open for new development while the new era has come,” Chen said.
“The new foreign investment law, due to take effect next year, will help foreign investors find new room for growth and we expect foreign companies to contribute even more in this process,” Chen added.
