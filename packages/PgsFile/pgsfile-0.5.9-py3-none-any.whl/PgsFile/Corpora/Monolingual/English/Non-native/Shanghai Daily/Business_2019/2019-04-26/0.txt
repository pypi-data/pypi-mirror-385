Are you being served? Man vs machine 
2019-04-26
With self-service stores on the rise, those with both human assistants and machines will likely be the future, rather than complete automation, the China Vending & Smart Retailing Show heard yesterday.
“Unattended shops and vending machines are mushrooming across China thanks to technological advances,” Jerry Huang, a partner with global consultancy Kantar, said at the show at the Shanghai New International Expo Center in Pudong.
“However, shops combining  human and mechanical forces will be the favored model as consumers still need help when shopping, and shops need human beings to see what really matters to consumers.”
The market value of unmanned retail, including unattended shops and vending machines, hit 20 billion yuan (US$3 billion) in 2018, and will continue to grow fast this year, Huang said.
“Even if you favor assistant-free shops, you need people to decide what to put in the shops,” said Zhou Qi, CEO of Vingoo, a self-service juice machine provider.
