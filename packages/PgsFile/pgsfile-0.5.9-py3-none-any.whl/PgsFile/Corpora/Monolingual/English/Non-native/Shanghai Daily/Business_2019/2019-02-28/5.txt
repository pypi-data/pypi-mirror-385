Good Doctor revenue sees healthy jump 
2019-02-28
Ping AN Good Doctor posted 79 percent revenue growth year on year in 2018 — its first fiscal year report after its IPO in Hong Kong — thanks to its booming core business and growing paid user base, the company said yesterday.
Its net loss also narrowed to 912 million yuan (US$136.53 million) from 1 billion yuan a year earlier.
Shanghai-based Good Doctor invested heavily in artificial intelligence and global expansion after the IPO.
Revenue for 2018 was 3.34 billion yuan, up 78.7 percent year on year and beating analysts’ forecasts of 2.96 billion yuan.
The growth came from the rapidly growing business of its online “Family Doctor” and the booming number of users.
By end-2018, the number of monthly paid users was 2.36 million, up 86.2 percent year on year, the company said.
Good Doctor also recently joined Grab in a US$140 million joint venture to tap the Southeast Asian online health care market.
Ping An Good Doctor shares fell 2.57 percent yesterday to HK$37.90, but remain 41 percent up this year.
