German chemical firm BASF yesterday unveiled its new research and development facility in Shanghai to enhance its regional innovation capabilities.
The 5,000-square-meter facility at BASF’s Innovation Campus Shanghai in the Pudong New Area includes its Automotive Application Center and Process Catalysis R&D Center, with a combined investment of up to 34 million euro (US$38.3 million).
“Thanks to our continuous investment in R&D, we are able to support our customers in China and the entire Asia-Pacific region,” said Stephan Kothrade, chairman of BASF China.
The company has invested nearly 180 million euro in China since 2012.
Also at the inauguration, BASF presented a range of innovations to support customers in industries such as automotive, construction and consumer goods, in particular a waterborne coating system that was newly introduced on the Chinese mainland.
