Among the top 20 cities, nine were from North America, eight were Asian, while the other three were in Western Europe.
The report covered 1,006 cities across the world. New York, London and Singapore were the top three. Besides the five Chinese cities in the top 20, another 15 made the top 100.
The report also studied urban sustainable competitiveness, “the ability of a city to enhance its advantages in economy, society, ecology, innovation and global connection, and to seek systematic optimization to meet the complex and advanced welfare utility of its citizens.”
Five American cities, nine European cities and six Asian cities made it into the top 20.
In this aspect, Chinese cities still have gaps compared with those in developed countries. But 31 Chinese cities ranked among the top 200, “indicating that the sustainable competitiveness of cities in the country has steadily improved.”
