More than 50 world-class artificial intelligence firms will be based in the Pudong New Area in near future, creating an AI industry output of over 30 billion yuan (US$4.41 billion), officials said yesterday.
As a national AI innovation demonstration area, Pudong’s development models and experience will be copied and promoted nationwide. Those firms cover AI chips, connected cars, robots and smart-device sectors, mainly in industrial parks in Zhangjiang, Jinqiao and Lingang.
In Zhangjiang’s new AI Harbor region, more than a dozen firms have set up facilities, including overseas industry giants, leading dot-com firms, research institutes and startups. The firms include IBM, Microsoft, Alibaba, the Tongji University and Cloudwork, an AI startup.
