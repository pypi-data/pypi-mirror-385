More sectors open to foreign investors 
2019-07-01
CHINA yesterday rolled out revised negative lists for foreign investment market access, introducing greater opening-up and allowing foreign investors to run majority-share-controlling or wholly owned businesses in more sectors.
The National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce released two negative lists of 2019. The two lists, one for the piloted free trade zones and one for the rest of the country, contain fewer access-limiting measures. Pilot FTZs now have 37 listed items for foreign investors, down from 45, while non-FTZ areas are required to implement 40 items instead of 48.
They will go into effect on July 30, and market access restrictions not on the negative lists will be fully lifted before the end of this year, said an official with the NDRC.
The negative lists for market access outline sectors, fields and businesses off-limits for investors. Industries, fields and businesses not on the lists are open for investment to all market players. Chinese authorities revise the negative lists for market access on an annual basis.
The service sector will see greater opening-up in transport, infrastructure, culture and value-added telecommunications.
The restriction that domestic shipping agencies must be controlled by the Chinese side will be scrapped. The restriction that gas and heat pipelines in cities with a population of more than 500,000 shall be controlled by the Chinese side will be lifted. The restriction that cinemas and performance brokerage institutions must be controlled by the Chinese side will be rescinded. The restriction on foreign investment in domestic multi-party communications, store-and-forward and call center services will be canceled.
