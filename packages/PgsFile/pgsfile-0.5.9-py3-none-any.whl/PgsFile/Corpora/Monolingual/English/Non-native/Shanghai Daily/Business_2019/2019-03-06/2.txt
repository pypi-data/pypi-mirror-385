Tesla’s Model 3 sedans arrive in Tianjin 
2019-03-06
A BIG batch of Tesla’s long-range Model 3 sedans have arrived at north China’s Tianjin Port after 84 such cars were imported via the port in February.
A total of 1,171 Model 3 sedans, in addition to 44 models of Tesla’s other lineups and 590 cars of other brands, were imported via the same freighter, according to freight authorities at the port.
Customs clearance has been suspended for these cars as authorities cite various irregularities, including improper labeling of the vehicles, financial publication Caixin reported yesterday.
Making inroads in China, the world’s largest electric vehicle market, is crucial for the Silicon Valley carmaker as it seeks to offset softening demand in the United States and convince investors of its ability to become consistently profitable.
Until then, Tesla has to import US-made cars with substantial customs duties, putting it at a disadvantage against locally made electric vehicles from rivals such as Nio Inc, Byton and XPeng Motors.
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, in 2018, 1.27 million new energy vehicles were produced in China, while about 1.26 million were sold, up 59.9 percent and 61.7 percent year on year, respectively. The booming NEV market in China has drawn the attention of foreign carmakers including Tesla.
