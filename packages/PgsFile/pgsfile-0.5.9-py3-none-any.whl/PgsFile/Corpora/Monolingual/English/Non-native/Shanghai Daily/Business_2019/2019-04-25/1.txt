Shanghai frontrunner as country goes to 5G 
2019-04-25
Shanghai has become the first city in China to trial 5G networks, with 500 base stations and various 5G applications.
China Unicom will invest 15 billion yuan (US$2.23 billion) in Shanghai by 2021 on information infrastructure and 5G.
Shanghai will become the first city nationwide, among seven first-batch cities, to debut China Unicom’s 5G services, industry officials said at a function yesterday hosted by China Unicom and the Shanghai government.
During a test run, download speeds hit 729 megabits per second — 30 times faster than current 4G networks. With 5G support, cloud gameing allows users to play games instantly without downloading applications.
Shanghai now has more than 500 5G base stations put up by carriers including China Mobile and China Unicom.
China Unicom, the country's biggest carrier after China Mobile, also announced a partnership with industry giants, including smartphone vendor Oppo and online literature service provider China Literature yesterday.
Oppo and China Unicom said they would establish a joint innovation center for 5G technologies and applications. They also plan to open 100 5G experience centers nationwide, with the first two in downtown Shanghai.
Oppo will also offer China Unicom 5G versions of its popular Reno models, which boast the world’s first 10-time optical zoom lens in a mobile phone.
China Literature and China Unicom also kicked off a new smartphone with a Kindle-like e-ink screen, which is designed for long-time reading and eye protection.
The new “Pocket Reader” phone can store up to 9,000 e-books. It supports 12 million novels licensed by 2,000 publishers in seven languages.
