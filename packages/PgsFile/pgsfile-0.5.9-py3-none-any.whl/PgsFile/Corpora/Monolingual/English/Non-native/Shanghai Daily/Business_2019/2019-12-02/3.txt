Online sales top US$7.4b 
2019-12-02
THIS year’s Black Friday was the biggest ever for online sales, as fewer people hit the stores and shoppers rang up US$7.4 billion in transactions from their phones, computers and tablets.
That’s just behind the US$7.9 billion haul of last year’s Cyber Monday, which holds the one-day record for online sales, according to Adobe Analytics. Adobe measures sales at 80 of the top 100 US online retailers.
Adobe expects online sales to jump to another record this Cyber Monday with an estimated total of US$9.4 billion.
