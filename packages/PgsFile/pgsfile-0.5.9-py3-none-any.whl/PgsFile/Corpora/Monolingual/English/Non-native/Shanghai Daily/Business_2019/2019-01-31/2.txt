WM Motor, Meituan in new project 
2019-01-31
Shanghai-based carmaker WM Motor yesterday inked a strategic cooperation deal with Meituan Dache on ride-hailing services.
Under the deal, WM Motor’s EX5 electric sport-utility vehicle will be introduced onto the Meituan Dache ride-hailing services platform.
And Meituan Dache, a unit of Hong Kong-listed diversified lifestyle services group Meituan Dianping, will use its customer base and expertise in areas such as Big Data to connect WM to its users.
WM Motor said the cooperation deal will help both sides as they strive to offer a more comfortable and affordable experience for both driver and passenger as well as enhance the quality of ride-hailing services. The companies said they would explore further areas for cooperation, but did not give details.
WM Motor, founded in 2015, is one of China’s leading electric car startups. It opened a factory in Zhejiang Province in 2016 and launched the  EX5, its first production car, last April.
