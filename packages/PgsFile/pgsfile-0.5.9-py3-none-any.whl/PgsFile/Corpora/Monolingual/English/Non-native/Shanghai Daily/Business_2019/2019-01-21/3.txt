BI begins animal vaccine production 
2019-01-21
GERMAN drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim has started commercial production at its 85 million euro (US$96.6 million) animal vaccine manufacturing plant in Taizhou in Jiangsu Province. 
And it said it will spend another 12 million euros to double capacity and quality assurance next year for its vaccine business.
“It’s an important milestone for BI which includes a complete value chain for swine vaccines, covering R&D, production and sales in China and we look forward to bringing products which are researched and developed specifically for China,” said Felix Gutsche, managing director of BI for the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  
The localized production will speed production and supply. Previously, supply relied on the US which could take at least four weeks.
The new plant will also serve other overseas markets.  
“We believe that the implementation of the national strategy for the Yangtze River Delta will help significantly consolidate talent and technology resources in the delta and lead to higher quality integrated development,” said Stephan Lange, head of animal health for China’s mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
