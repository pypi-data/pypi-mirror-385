Business jet CBJ takes to the air in Paris 
2019-06-19
A CHINESE business jet has made its overseas debut at the ongoing biennial Paris Air Show.
The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China took a 1:10 model of its CBJ business jet, based on the ARJ21, to the worldâ€™s largest air show.
COMAC has also taken models of the ARJ21 regional jet, C919 narrow-body jet and CR929 wide-body jet.
The CBJ features more cabin space than rivals in the same class. It can be configured with 12 to 29 seats, a separate VIP bedroom, lounge, meeting room, sitting room and dining section, depending on the demands of the customer.
It has better soundproofing, a range of 5,500 kilometers, and can adapt to a wide variety of flying conditions, from extreme temperatures to high altitudes and strong crosswinds.
The ARJ21 began commercial flights on June 28, 2016, with mass production starting in September 2017. Currently, Chengdu Airlines operates 11 ARJ21 jets.
A second operator, Genghis Khan Airlines, will begin flights early next month. Over 100 ARJ21s will be delivered in the next five years, as COMAC challenges the dominance of Bombardier and Embraer in regional jets.
