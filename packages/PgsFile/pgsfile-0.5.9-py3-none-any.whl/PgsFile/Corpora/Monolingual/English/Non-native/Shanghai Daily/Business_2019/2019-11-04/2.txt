5G boom in Tianjin 
2019-11-04
North China’s Tianjin will have around 6,000 5G base stations built by China Mobile by the end of 2020, the company’s Tianjin branch said. 
So far, the Tianjin branch of China Mobile has built more than 2,000 5G base stations in the city, covering many key areas such as the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. The figure is expected to reach 3,000 by year-end. In early June, China granted 5G licenses for commercial use, marking the beginning of a new era in the country’s telecommunications industry.
