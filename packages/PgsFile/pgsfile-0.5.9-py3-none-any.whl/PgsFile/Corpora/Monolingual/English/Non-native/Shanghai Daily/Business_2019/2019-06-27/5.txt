Huawei expects to retain top 5G rank 
2019-06-27
Sanctions-hit Huawei Technologies will remain a leading player in the global 5G market, thanks to multiple-layer supply system and overseas expansion outside the United States, the tech giant said yesterday.
Huawei made a plea for “non-discriminatory treatment” from the authorities and governments worldwide, the company’s deputy chairman Ken Hu said in Shanghai. 
Huawei Technologies has secured 50 5G commercial contracts globally — two-thirds of the world’s total. It has offered 150,000 5G base stations globally now, which is likely to touch 500,000 this year.
The US put Huawei on a trade blacklist in May and has since put restrictions on American tech firms in offering chips and services to Huawei. 
“It won’t influence Huawei’s 5G leading position at all,” said Hu. 
“It’s a huge loss for carriers and consumers to enjoy 5G without Huawei’s devices and advanced technologies.”
Without Huawei, Europe’s 5G development will lag “at least two years,” Hu added.
At the opening session of the MWC Shanghai 2019, a senior government official also spoke against “technical bullying.”
“Unfair and technical bullying” still exists in the world. They are challenges to the healthy and sustainable development of 5G and the whole digital economy,” said Liu Liehong, vice director of Cyberspace Administration of China. 
Huawei’s devices are used in more than 30 countries, including Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa. 
China, as the world’s biggest mobile network, gave out commercial 5G licenses on June 6. Huawei expects new contracts from Chinese operators. 
Huawei has invested US$4 billion on 5G technologies and it will keep increasing the investment. 
It has established a multiple-layer supplier system for chip and software and does not have to depend solely on US suppliers, Hu noted.
