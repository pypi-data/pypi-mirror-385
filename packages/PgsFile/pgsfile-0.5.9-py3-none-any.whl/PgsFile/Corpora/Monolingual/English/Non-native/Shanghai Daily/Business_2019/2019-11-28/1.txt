Economic concerns hits ad spending 
2019-11-28
Advertising spending losses in the first three quarters of 2019 narrowed from the first half as macroeconomic concerns pushed the restructuring of ad markets.
In the three quarters ending in September, total expenditures were down 8 percent against an 8.8 percent decline in the first half, according to CTR Market Research.
Advertisersâ€™ confidence was swayed by worries over an unstable economic climate, it pointed out. 
Advertising income at TV and radio stations fell 10.8 and 10.7 respectively, against an increase of 3.6 percent and 8.3 percent from a year earlier, the worst performance in five years, after ad slots were cut following new rules by the General Administration of Press and Publication. 
Ad income declines among print magazines narrowed to 7 percent while spending on outdoor posters retreated 19.8 percent. 
Combined ad spending through all media formats from food and beverage companies increased by 16.9 percent as they turned to new product launches to boost sales. Snack companies and dairy product makers were particularly prominent.  
Other heavy ad spenders included communications, pharma companies and retailers or commercial service providers.
Ad spending from Internet services and smartphone applications also went down 37 percent and 5.9 percent respectively as they sought more cost-effective measures to find new users.
