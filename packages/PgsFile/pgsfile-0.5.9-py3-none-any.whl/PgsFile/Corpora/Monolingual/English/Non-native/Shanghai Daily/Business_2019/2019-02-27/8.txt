Changing demands of tourists 
2019-02-27
China’s tourism sector is seeing a vibrant change in consumption patterns with tourists preferring to spend more money on quality experiences, a new report says.
The report, jointly released by Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and global measurement and data analytics company Nielsen, found 82 percent of the 1,000 respondents said they are willing to pay good money for a more luxurious travel experience.
The report found that compared with the past few years, Chinese tourists would like to explore local customs and reach out to local people, seeking unique and cultural experiences.
Comfort is the first and foremost demand of Chinese tourists, as they believe that travel mirrors their lifestyle and attitude, the report said.
In addition, when choosing a hotel, some people look for “refreshing” experiences, some favor hotels decorated with local cultural characteristics and others simply want their living needs to be met.
Boosted by increasing income and China’s efforts to shift its economy to a growth model that draws strength from consumption and services, the tourism industry is becoming a new growth engine.
