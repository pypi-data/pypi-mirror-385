Regulators press ‘play’ for online games 
2019-04-23
Chinese regulators have resumed approving licenses for new computer games, with tougher rules covering game names, gambling and violent content in the world’s largest gaming market.
Regulators stopped approving new games more than a year ago, which hit industry leaders such as Tencent and NetEase.
English is now no longer allowed in official names of games published in China. Excessive violence and gambling are also banned and images of corpses should disappear “as soon as possible,” the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China said in a statement yesterday.
And virtual marriages are banned in games aimed at people under 18.
The new rules on applications for publishing online games in China may bring fresh air and opportunities to the gaming industry, after the authorities stopped granting licenses in March last year. Approvals resumed in December, but without clear guidelines.
The tougher rules are especially designed to protect younger gamers.
