Thomas Cook deal 
2019-10-10
HAYS Travel will buy all Thomas Cook’s British travel agent shops, potentially saving up to 2,500 jobs, Britain’s insolvency agency said yesterday, in a rare reprieve for high streets across the country. Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel company, collapsed last month and its UK business went into liquidation. Hays Travel will acquire all 555 stores and look to re-employ former employees from Thomas Cook, Britain’s Insolvency Service said in a statement. The 40-year-old firm had sales of more than 1 billion pounds (US$1.22 billion) in 2018. Thomas Cook’s collapse stranded hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparked the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
