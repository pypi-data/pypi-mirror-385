Sessions to focus on least developed nations 
2019-11-01
MATCHMAKING sessions for exhibitors and buyers at the second China International Import Expo will be held from November 6-8.
Exhibitors and buyers from over 90 countries and regions have signed up, covering seven exhibition areas, according to Cao Pei of the China International Import Expo Bureau.
“This year we will pay more attention to the economic and trade development of the least developed countries and offer better support and assistance to enterprises from these countries,” Cao said. “For instance, we will set up a special national area for Uzbekistan at the supply-demand sessions.”
The meeting area this year will be able to accommodate 2,000 people at the same time, Cao said.
The large-scale supply-demand matchmaking fairs during the expo are hosted by the CIIE Bureau and the National Convention and Exhibition Center and organized by the Bank of China to serve as a platform to enable participants to meet potential partners.
At the three days of meetings during the first CIIE last year, 1,178 exhibitors and 2,462 buyers from 82 countries and regions held several rounds of one-on-one talks and signed preliminary agreements on 657 transactions.
The Bank of China will provide support at the meetings with the latest technologies. Its self-developed BOC Global Matchmaking System aims to serve as a platform to promote cross-border investment and cooperation of SMEs and solve their financing difficulties.
