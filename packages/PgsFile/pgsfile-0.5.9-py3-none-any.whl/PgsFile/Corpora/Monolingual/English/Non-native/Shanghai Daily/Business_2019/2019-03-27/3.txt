P30 to take on Europe 
2019-03-27
Huawei presented its new flagship phone in Paris yesterday with the hope of making further gains in Europe.
   Huawei’s P30 Pro, which has four rear cameras — including a so-called “time of flight” camera that helps its artificial intelligence create better exposures — will aim to take on Samsung’s Galaxy S10 and Apple’s iPhone X.
   The phone has a new light sensor that detects yellow rather than green, which Huawei said would significantly boost light absorption to create better results, even in near darkness.
   The P30 Pro, Huawei’s P30 premium version, also uses electromagnetism to vibrate the screen to create a speaker when the device is held up to the face, minimizing any sound problems when taking a telephone call, added the company.
   Starting prices are 999 euros (US$1,128) for the P30 Pro and 799 euros for the P30.
