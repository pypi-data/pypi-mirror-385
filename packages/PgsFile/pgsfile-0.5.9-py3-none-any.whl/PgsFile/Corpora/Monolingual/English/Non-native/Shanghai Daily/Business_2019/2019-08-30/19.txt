SELF-DRIVING cars are highlighted at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference which opened in Shanghai yesterday.
Until tomorrow, residents can make a reservation to experience self-driving vehicles from more than 20 domestic and foreign companies.
The self-driving experience area, covering about 36,000 square meters, displays technologies including autonomous driving, integration between vehicles and 5G technologies as well as automatic parking.
“In the past, only a small number of people could experience self-driving cars. During the conference this year, the experience area allows more citizens to experience autonomous driving,” said Li Lin, general manager of the Shanghai Intelligent Connected Vehicle Innovation Center.
“It is expected that more than 500 people will participate in the self-driving car experience every day during the three-day conference.”
In addition to self-driving passenger cars, there are also autonomous buses.
The buses can easily change modes based on demand between freight and passengers.
