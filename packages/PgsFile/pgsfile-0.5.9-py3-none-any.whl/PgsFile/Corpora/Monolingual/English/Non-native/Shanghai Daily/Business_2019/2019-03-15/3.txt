Aviation carriers, liquor firms and cement manufacturers were among the few sectors that registered increases. The country’s three largest carriers led the rises, with China Eastern Airlines soaring 6.7 percent to 6.21 yuan, and China Southern Airlines and national flag-carrier Air China both gaining more than 4 percent.

More than 100 companies on the two bourses fell by the daily 10 percent limit. Notably, major gainers on previous trading days, including livestock- and poultry-raising firms, telecoms service providers, high-tech park developers and media companies, led yesterday’s declines, shedding 6.26 percent, 5.02 percent, 4.96 percent and 4.63 percent.
China’s industrial output growth narrowed to 5.3 percent year on year in the first two months of 2019 from a 5.7 percent rise in December, while retail sales of consumer goods jumped 8.2 percent between January and February from the same period a year ago, unchanged from last December, data released earlier yesterday by the National Bureau of Statistics showed.
