Changing carriers 
2019-10-10
SHANGHAI residents will be able to switch phone companies while keeping their numbers from December 1, the city government said yesterday. Customers wanting to switch operators, except those with numbers starting with 157 or 188, can do so once their current contract ends and as long as they have no outstanding bills.
