A NATIONWIDE procedure to register investors who suffered losses in fundraising schemes on online peer-to-peer lending platforms Ezubao and zhimajinrong.com is set from July 2 to August 30, 2019.
The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Peopleâ€™s Court notice said yesterday that investors can register themselves at designated sites in Ezubao-related cases with their household registration addresses or residence addresses.
Locations of the registration sites will be publicized by local authorities in the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities concerned.
Participants in Ezubao schemes are supposed to provide information of their losses, personal identity card, contact information and bank accounts during the registration process.
