Vivo’s 5G investments 
2019-09-18
Chinese smartphone maker Vivo plans to invest heavily in 5G and 6G technologies with an eye on the high-end market. Apple did not add 5G features to its latest iPhones released this week, leaving market space for Chinese-brand phones like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, industry insiders said. Vivo will invest in 5G and 6G “without any budget limit,” the company said.
