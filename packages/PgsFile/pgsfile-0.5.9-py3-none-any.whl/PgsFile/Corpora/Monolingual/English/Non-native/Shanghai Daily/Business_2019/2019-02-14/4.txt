2019-02-14
Lower-tier cities saw the biggest growth in sales volume of on-demand delivery services during the Chinese New Year as consumers from inland regions embraced booming new consumption channels, according to Alibaba’s lifestyle services platforms Koubei and Ele.me.
Eight out of the top 10 fastest-growing cities for delivery orders during the Chinese New Year were third-tier cities, Ele.me data showed.
Baoding, Langfang and Yancheng were the top three cities for the number of deliveries, while Shantou, Dongguan, Foshan and Hefei were also amongst the fastest growing.
About 4,000 deliveries were sent on Chinese New Year’s Eve to people at work in places such as police stations, fire departments and sanitation bureaus, and hundreds of thousands of delivery staff were also hard at work delivering orders during the weeklong holiday.
Delivery orders nowadays not only include meals and beverages, but also groceries and flowers as consumers embrace new buying options.
Educational institutions and childhood learning spaces also gained traction, with sales volume climbing 60 percent from the same period a year earlier.
And tastes in sport and recreation are also diversifying, spending at skiing stadiums, ping pong houses and swimming pools all rose 30 percent from a year earlier.
But yoga was the standout as the fastest-growing segment, jumping more than four times on an annual basis.
China has one of the world’s leading e-commerce economies, with cashless and online shopping booming.
