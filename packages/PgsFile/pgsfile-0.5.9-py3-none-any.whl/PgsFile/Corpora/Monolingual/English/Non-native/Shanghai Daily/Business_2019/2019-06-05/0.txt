2019-06-05
Chinese developers and applications shone at Apple’s World Wide Developers Conference held in San Jose, California, on Monday.
   More than 5,000 people from 86 countries and regions attended the WWDC, including about 300 Chinese developers, according to Apple’s statement and media reports.
   Yang Jingsheng, vice president of qingting.fm, a Shanghai-based online radio startup, was one of them.
Apple’s opening of stream API will help Apple and developers build a more open and accessible music and radio ecosystem. The services will touch more devices and streams as the 5G era looms, Yang said.
   Qingting.fm, which has 450 million users and covers 1,500 radio stations, will update its application after the new iOS system is released.
