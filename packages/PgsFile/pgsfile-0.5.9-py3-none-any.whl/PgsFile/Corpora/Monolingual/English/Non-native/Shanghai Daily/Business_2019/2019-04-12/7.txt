2019-04-12
CHINA yesterday expressed the hope for smooth progress in negotiations on free trade zone with Japan and South Korea.
The 15th round of negotiations on China-Japan-South Korea Free Trade Zone is being held in Tokyo from Tuesday to today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said yesterday, expecting positive results that will lay a solid foundation for a comprehensive, high-level and mutually beneficial agreement.
Since the seventh China-Japan-South Korea leaders’ meeting in May, cooperation among the three countries has steadily advanced and has shown a good momentum of development, Lu said.
China, Japan and South Korea have firmly stood for free trade and actively promoted regional economic integration. This round of FTZ negotiations shows the common resolve of the three countries to maintain the multilateral trading system and oppose protectionism and unilateralism, he added.
Noting this year marks the 20th anniversary of the China-Japan-South Korea cooperation, Lu said the three countries are facing new development opportunities.
As the chairman of China-Japan-South Korea cooperation in 2019, China is willing to work with Japan and South Korea to successfully hold a series of important meetings and activities including the leaders’ meeting, open a new chapter in cooperation of the three countries at a new historical starting point, and open up a new dimension in East Asian cooperation, said the spokesman.
