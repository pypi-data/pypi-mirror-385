Passenger car sales lowest in 7 years 
2019-02-19
China’s auto market dived in January, with sales down 15.8 percent year on year, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed yesterday.
China sold 2.367 million vehicles last month.
Output reached 2.365 million units, down 12.1 percent from a year earlier.
Passenger car sales fell for the seventh straight month, plunging 17.7 percent year on year to 2.02 million units.
This marks the biggest decrease since January 2012.
Xu Haidong, assistant secretary-general of the CAAM, said sales will likely continue the downward trend in February, partly due to a slowing economy and a demand decline in smaller cities.
The slowdown can also be attributed to the Spring Festival holiday, which started on February 5, as consumers always delay their purchases ahead of holidays, analysts said.
The January drop comes on the heels of a 2.76-percent drop in last year’s sales, the first decline in 28 years.
There was still a bright spot though last month. New energy vehicles performed strongly, with sales surging 138 percent year on year to 96,000 units. Sales of all-electric cars hit 75,000 vehicles, up 179.7 percent, while those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles amounted to 21,000, up 54.6 percent.
Thanks to the government’s preferential policies to boost clean energy use to curb pollution, China has become one of the fastest-growing NEV markets in the world.
