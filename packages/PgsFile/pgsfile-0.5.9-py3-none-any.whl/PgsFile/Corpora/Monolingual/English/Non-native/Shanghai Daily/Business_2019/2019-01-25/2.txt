Didi to levy festival rush surcharge 
2019-01-25
Didi Chuxing will levy a surcharge of between 1 and 9 yuan (US$0.10-$1.30) a trip during the peak of the Spring Festival rush to address a shortage of drivers and vehicles, the company said yesterday.
The extra service fee in 268 cities from January 28 to February 10 — the busiest period of the 40-day rush — will be paid in full to drivers, with nothing to Didi which normally charges a 20-25 percent commission on standard fares.
The actual amount passengers will pay will depend on when and where they hail their ride.
Didi will also pay a subsidy to drivers in key areas of the 268 cities from January 28 to February 19.
But some passengers complain that even with driver incentives at busy times they often have to wait hours longer than normal.
Didi will also monitor weather across the nation and alert drivers and passengers of extreme conditions during the festival rush.
And earlier this week, Didi announced a special task force under President Liu Qing and Chief Executive Officer Cheng Wei to oversee safety.
