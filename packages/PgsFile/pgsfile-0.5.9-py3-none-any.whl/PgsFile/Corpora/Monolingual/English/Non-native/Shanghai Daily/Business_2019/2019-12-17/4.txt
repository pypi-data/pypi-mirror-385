2019-12-17
The total area of new residential properties sold in Shanghai, excluding government-funded affordable housing, jumped 39.3 percent to around 163,000 square meters during the seven-day period ending on Sunday, Shanghai Centaline Property Consultants Co said.
   Nanhui in the Pudong New Area surged to first place with weekly transactions hitting 48,000 square meters. Qingpu and Songjiang districts and Pudong, all managed to register sales above 10,000 square meters.
   “The extremely robust sales recorded in Nanhui did go beyond market expectations,” said Lu Wenxi, Centaline’s senior research manager. “Last week’s top three most popular projects were all located in Nanhui, which was very rare.”
   A project in remote Nanhui with a price tag of 30,978 yuan (US$4,417) per square meter dwarfed all by selling 16,709 square meters, or 190 units, of new homes last week.
