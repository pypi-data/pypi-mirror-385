Juhuasuan, J&J to develop local brands 
2019-12-26
Johnson & Johnson’s China consumer health unit said it’s working with Alibaba’s Juhuasuan platform (crowdfunding for discounts) to promote and encourage the development of local brands by leveraging J&J’s strong innovation capabilities and Juhuasuan’s extensive reach with consumers.
J&J will also work with Juhuasuan on tailor-made health and wellness solutions for various consumer groups and boost the sales of not just one brand, but also the whole product portfolio of its healthcare lines.
Previous successful collaboration between J&J and Alibaba’s Tmall includes its infant skincare brand Aveeno and medical cosmetics skincare brand Dr.Ci:Labo. The new partnership is expected to expand to other healthcare offerings.
Deng Xu, managing director of J&J Consumer Health China, said the tie-up will cover more product categories including oral health and skincare, to cater to rising demand in China.
General Manager Su Yu of Juhuasuan’s marketing department said it aims to bring new shoppers to existing brands and also to provide tailor-made products for shoppers in lower-tier cities by working more closely with established brands.
J&J will contribute startup funds and technical support while Juhuasuan will offer consumer insights and data analysis.
