2019-09-19
Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G are creating higher demands for cybersecurity and privacy protection, according to PwC’s 2019 Digital Trust Insights China Report. 
Some 28 percent of respondents say the most acute risk stemming from the digital transformation process is data governance or privacy, according to the survey of 121 Chinese cybersecurity executives.  
“Companies are under pressure to use innovations in artificial, blockchain, cloud computing and 5G in their operations in order to realize growth, therefore giving rise to an increase in demand for privacy and data protection,” said Ramesh Moosa, Cybersecurity, Privacy & Forensics partner at PwC China.
Only about 24 percent of Chinese executives and IT professionals are confident they can manage risks stemming from digital transformation, below the global average of 31 percent who believe they are very effective at doing so.
As many as 83 percent of Chinese respondents agree that their cybersecurity teams are being embedded in their business and a cybersecurity strategy is in place to support business initiatives, compared with 72 percent globally.
