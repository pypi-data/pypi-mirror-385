A joint-venture by the two firms will provide customized services for investors based on their investment objectives, time horizon and risk preferences, according to a statement released on Saturday.
The services are available for minimum investments of 800 yuan (US$113) and accessible through the Alipay app, a popular third-party fintech platform run by Ant Financial.
“We are delighted to bring this important service to more people in China and look forward to supporting the sustainable growth of the wealth management industry,” said Peter Zhang, CEO of the joint venture.
