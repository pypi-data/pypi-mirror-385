The Shanghai composite, the country’s major share average, fell 1.15 percent or 28.61 points to close at 2,465.29, following disappointing results the manufacturing sector last month.
On Monday, the National Bureau of Statistics released the official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, which dropped below the critical 50 level to 49.4. 
This marked the first contraction since July 2016 and the weakest reading since February 2016.
A reading above 50 reveals expansion, while a reading below that indicates contraction.

The smaller Shenzhen Component Index dropped 1.25 percent to end at around 7,149.27 points, while the Nasdaq-style ChiNext enterprise board shed 1.74 percent to finish at 1,228.77 percent.
