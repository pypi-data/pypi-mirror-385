Bilibili revenue, expenses surge in Q4 
2019-03-01
Shanghai-headquartered online entertainment and gaming platform Bilibili said revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 57 percent to 1.16 billion yuan (US$168.1 million), but net losses amounted to 150 million yuan following its investment in content production and marketing activities.
Selling and marketing expenses nearly tripled to 182.3 million yuan, which was primarily due to increased channel and marketing expenses associated with Bilibili’s app and brand, the NASDAQ-listed company said in its earnings release. 
Mobile gaming is still the biggest revenue contributor — 712.8 million yuan in the three months ended December. 
“We strengthened our animation, mobile games content and commercialization capabilities by securing relationships with market leaders Tencent and Alibaba, and we will continue to grow our business by adding best-in-class content to our industry-leading platform and further increasing the bond within our community,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chen Rui said.   
Total revenue soared 67 percent to 4.1 billion yuan in 2018.
Membership income also climbed, with average monthly paying users reaching 4.4 million — three times more than the same period a year earlier. 
It has also been beefing up efforts in self-produced variety shows and domestic animation series.
“We have seen a more balanced revenue mix with increased revenue contribution from our advertising and live broadcasting, and value-added service businesses,” said Chief Financial Officer Sam Fan.  
Brand advertising and performance-based advertising also boosted ad income.
