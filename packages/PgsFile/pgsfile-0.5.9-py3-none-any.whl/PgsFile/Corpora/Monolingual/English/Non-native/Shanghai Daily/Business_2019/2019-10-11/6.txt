Apple removes misused HK app 
2019-10-11
APPLE yesterday removed an app used by protesters in Hong Kong to track police movement.
The move came after Chinese state media this week criticized the app, which collates information on police locations submitted by users, charging that it was helping rioters.
The People’s Daily has said by stocking the app, Apple was “mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts.”
The app was no longer available on Apple’s Hong Kong App Store yesterday.
“We have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police,” said a notification sent by Apple and published on the HKmap.live’s Telegram channel, which has more than 70,000 subscribers.
“Criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,” it continued.
