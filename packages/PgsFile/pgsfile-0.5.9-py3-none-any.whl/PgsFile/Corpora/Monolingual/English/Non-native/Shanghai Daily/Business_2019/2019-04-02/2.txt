China’s first globally oriented credit-and-rating tool, which utilizes data from more than 300 million organizations and provides English-language support, has debuted in Shanghai.
The online tool, Qixinbao, which was developed by Shanghai-based CC Intelligence and 3ACredit, targets a credit-and-rating market valued at more than 10 billion yuan (US$1.49 billion) annually.
Qixinbao supports English and Chinese and offers credit-rating and data services for global firms.
The credit-and-rating market is not only massive in terms of value, it is also important to China’s social and trade development, said Michael Zhen, founder and CEO of CC Intelligence.
CC Intelligence now has 700 million users worldwide.
