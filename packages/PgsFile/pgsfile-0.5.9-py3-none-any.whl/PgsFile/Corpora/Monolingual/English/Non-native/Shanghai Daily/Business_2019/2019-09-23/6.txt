Just scan a QR code on a vending machine, then you will be given a drink. The special vending machine placed at the cybersecurity expo held in Tianjin has attracted many people to try it out.
Once you scan the code, you will receive a message in a second, reminding you that “arbitrary code-sweeping will endanger personal property safety,” as your personal information might have been illegally collected. This machine was installed by 360 Security Technology Inc.
The expo is a part of a cybersecurity publicity campaign held in north China’s Tianjin Municipality, aiming to promote public awareness of the issue.
In fact, it is also a part of the 2019 China Cybersecurity Week, held from September 16 to yesterday nationwide.
The campaign was jointly launched by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission and the ministries of education, public security and industry and information technology.
Over 100 cybersecurity and Internet enterprises have attended various activities held during the week.
Meanwhile, there were themed activities to promote cybersecurity issues related to students, the telecommunication sector and the financial sector.
