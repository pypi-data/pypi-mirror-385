Creative China the biggest exporter of ideas, arts 
2019-01-16
China is now the world’s biggest single exporter and importer of creative goods and services, a new report by the UN Conference on Trade and Development said yesterday.
And the country accounts for more than one-third of global art sales at auction, latest Creative Economy Outlook: Trends in International Trade in Creative Industries report says.
A section of the report, which profiles 30 developed and developing countries, charts “China’s remarkable rise in the trade of creative goods.”
China’s film production is also set to soar and the country accounts for a significant portion of the global trade of design products such as furniture, fashion, and jewelry.
The data covers 2002 to 2015 and shows the creative economy’s contribution to world trade.
China’s growth in trade in creative goods between 2002 and 2015 has been exponential — averaging 14 percent annually.
In 2002, China’s trade in creative goods was US$32 billion. By 2014, this had increased more than fivefold to US$191.4 billion.
For the first time, the economic contribution of creative services, not just goods, is also measured at the country level in the report.
“The creative economy has both commercial and cultural worth,” said Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who directs UNCTAD’s trade division.
“Creative industries generate income through trade and intellectual property rights, and create new opportunities, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises,” Coke-Hamilton said.
Creative industries include architecture, arts and crafts, marketing and advertising, media and publishing, research and development, software and computer games.
Design and visual arts are among the highest performing sectors, with fashion, interior design and jewelry accounting for 54 percent of creative goods exports.
