Better rapeseed 
2019-08-19
Chinese researchers have used gene-editing technology to develop a new type of high-yielding rapeseed, according to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. 
Height and branch numbers are essential components of rapeseed and directly affect yield. Researchers from the Oil Crops Research Institute of CAAS used a gene-editing tool to knock out the gene called BnaMAX1s, which resulted in a 30 percent increase in yield.
