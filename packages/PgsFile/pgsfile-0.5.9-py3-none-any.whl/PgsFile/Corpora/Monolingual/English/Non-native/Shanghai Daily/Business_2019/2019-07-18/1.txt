Investors remain positive about China’s real-estate market, despite concerns over a slowdown as well as uncertainty surrounding the global economy, the latest investment survey conducted by global property consultancy Colliers International discovered.
Nearly half of respondents indicated the willingness to continue investing in real estate while about 44 percent chose to sit on the sidelines and wait for clarity, according to the survey of 100 professional investors and developers.
“We believe this indicates that over 90 percent of respondents remain positive about China’s real-estate market, despite worries about GDP growth in 2019 and beyond,” said Dave Chiou,  senior director of research for Colliers international’s China operation. “In fact, of the 100 respondents, only six expressed reluctance to invest further.”
When asked about investments this year, 68 percent said their total spending will increase or remain flat. Among those willing to spend, 22 percent had earmarked over US$500 million while the bulk of investors said they would adopt a slightly more conservative approach. A good 63 percent planned to spend between US$100 million and US$500 million.
East China, with 57 percent of the votes, remains the most popular, trailed by South China, which interests 26 percent of respondents, keen to make gains from the central government’s initiative to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
