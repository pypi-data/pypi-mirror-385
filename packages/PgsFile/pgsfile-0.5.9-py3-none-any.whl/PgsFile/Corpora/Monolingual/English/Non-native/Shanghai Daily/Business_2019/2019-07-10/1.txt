2019-07-10
Luxury car brands remained steady in China in the first half of the year despite a lackluster overall auto market.
   In June, sales of luxury cars jumped 24.9 percent year on year, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association released on Monday.
   Cadillac delivered 21,200 vehicles in June, up 51.5 percent year on year. Volvo and Lexus sold 67,700 and 93,800 vehicles in the first half of the year, respectively, up 10.2 percent and 36.5 percent year on year. The growth rate is higher than the 9.1 percent growth of the mainstream joint-venture brands and a decline of 8.3 percent for Chinese brands.
