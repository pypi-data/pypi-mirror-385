CHINA will roll out a guideline to better use foreign investment with a focus on safeguarding the national treatment of foreign-funded enterprises, an official said yesterday.
The guideline, which was adopted at an executive meeting of the State Council held on October 16, puts forward 20 policies in four aspects to create a more “fair, transparent and predictable” business environment for foreign-invested enterprises, said Vice Minister of Commerce and Deputy China International Trade Representative Wang Shouwen.
For a start, in deepening opening-up, China will continue to reduce the negative list for foreign investment access in the national and pilot free trade zones, and comprehensively eliminate restrictions that are not on the negative list.
China will accelerate the opening-up of the financial sector and optimize the foreign investment policies for automobiles, Wang said. It will optimize the scientific and technological innovation services for foreign-invested enterprises and improve the construction of pilot free trade zones.
Third, China will lower the cost of cross-border capital use, make it easier for foreigners to work in China, and optimize the approval process for the use of land for foreign-funded projects.
Fourth, China will fully implement the foreign investment law, establish and improve institutions for accepting complaints.
