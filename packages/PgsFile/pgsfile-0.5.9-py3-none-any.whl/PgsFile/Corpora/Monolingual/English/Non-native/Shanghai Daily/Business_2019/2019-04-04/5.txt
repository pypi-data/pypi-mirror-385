Renault takes action 
2019-04-04
The board of French carmaker Renault moved to scrap ousted boss Carlos Ghosn’s pension worth around 770,000 euros (US$865,000) annually.
Directors also recommended that shareholders block a further 224,000 euros in Ghosn’s variable pay for 2018, two sources said, following a meeting that also approved governance changes reducing the size of the board to 18 members from 20.
