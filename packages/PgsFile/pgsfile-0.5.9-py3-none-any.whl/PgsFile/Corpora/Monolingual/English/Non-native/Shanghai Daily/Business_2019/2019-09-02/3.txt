Unsold houses 
2019-09-02
The size of unsold new commercial residential houses in 100 surveyed Chinese cities rose 6 percent year on year to 449.27 million square meters by the end of July, an industry report showed.
The pressure of destocking housing inventories has been growing as the inventory capacity has maintained a trend of growth for eight consecutive months, E-house China R&D Institute said. The inventory in first-, second-, third- and fourth-tier cities by the end of July grew by 19.7 percent, 2 percent and 9.1 percent year on year, respectively. “The inventory pressure will continue to increase with the follow-up new supply of commercial houses,” said Yan Yuejin, research director at E-house R&D Institute.
