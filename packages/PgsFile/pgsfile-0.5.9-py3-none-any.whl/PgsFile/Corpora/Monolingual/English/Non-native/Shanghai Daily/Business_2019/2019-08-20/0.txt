Huawei granted reprieve to buy US supplies 
2019-08-20
THE United States will extend a reprieve given to Huawei Technologies that permits the Chinese firm to buy components from US companies to supply existing customers, but also moved to add more than 40 of Huawei’s units to its blacklist.
The extension was announced yesterday by US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
The 90-day extension “is intended to afford consumers across America the necessary time to transition away from Huawei equipment, given the persistent national security and foreign policy threat,” the Commerce Department said in a statement yesterday. “As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption,” said Ross.
Ross said the latest extension was to aid US customers, many of which operate networks in rural America. At the same time he said he was adding 46 Huawei affiliates to the “Entity List,” a list of companies effectively banned from doing businesses with US firms, raising the total number to more than 100 Huawei entities that are covered by the restrictions.
In response, Huawei said in a statement yesterday that “it’s clear that this decision, made at this particular time, is politically motivated and has nothing to do with national security.” The company called on the US government to end its unjust treatment and remove Huawei from the Entity List.
