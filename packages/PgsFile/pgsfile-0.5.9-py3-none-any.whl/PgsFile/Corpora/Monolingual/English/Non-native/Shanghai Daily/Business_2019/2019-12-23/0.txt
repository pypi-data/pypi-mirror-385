Benefits of smart economy 
2019-12-23
IFYOU ask the silver-haired residents of the elderly care community Yinheyuan in Beijing what they know about artificial intelligence, they will probably throw the question to the smart speakers within their reach.
These smart speakers, ca­pable of interacting with users with voice-recognition tech­nologies, are also part of the answer. Via voice command, senior residents can control lights, TVs and other home appliances, order food or ask for help.
AI is no longer a techni­cal term used exclusively by professionals in China. Both young and old are enjoying the benefits of the growing smart economy.
After personal computers, PC Internet and mobile Internet, the growth focus of China’s digital economy is shifting to smart technologies like AI, said Baidu Chairman and CEO Robin Li at the World Internet Conference in October.
In the smart economy era, Li predicted a declining reli­ance on cellphones and a rising popularity of other smart devices. AI chips, cloud com­puting services, among others, would become the new digital infrastructure, while innova­tive businesses will flourish as transport, health, education and other sectors go smart.
Wearable devices, smart home appliances, autonomous driving and smart cities are among the fastest-growing fields in the smart economy.
China is the largest smart speaker market in the world, accounting for 36 percent of global shipments in the third quarter of 2019, according to global market firm Strategy Analytics. It found in a July and August survey that 63 percent of Chinese people without a smart speaker planned to buy one within the following year. Another 22 percent planned to make a purchase later on.
Chinese firms are stepping up investment in 5G, AI and the Internet of Things to gain a foothold in the emerging field. By end-June, China had over 1,200 AI-related enterprises.
