2019-05-09
CHINA yesterday expressed regrets over the planned measures by the United States to raise tariffs on imported Chinese products, saying escalating trade frictions is against the interests of the two peoples as well as people of the world.
“China deeply regrets this, and will be forced to take necessary countermeasures if the US side puts the tariff measures into effect,” commerce ministry said in a statement yesterday.
The United States announced yesterday that it would raise tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent from Friday.
