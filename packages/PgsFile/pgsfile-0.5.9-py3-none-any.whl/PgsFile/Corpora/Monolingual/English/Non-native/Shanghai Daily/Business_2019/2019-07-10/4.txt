Over half of the sectors suffered losses, with home-appliance makers, banks and property developers among the top losers. Shares of Zhejiang Kang Sheng Co Ltd, a company with core competitiveness in home appliances, declined by 3.92 percent to stand at 3.43 yuan a share.
Meanwhile, the market was keeping an eye on testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell due today.
