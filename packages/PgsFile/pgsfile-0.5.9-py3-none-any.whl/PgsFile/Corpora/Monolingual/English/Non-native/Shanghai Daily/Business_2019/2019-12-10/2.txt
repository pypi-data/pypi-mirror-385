The company acquired Suzhou Olyto Automation Technology Co, automation equipment, testing equipment and precision molds company. HYC will use its shares to pay 70 percent of the acquisition value, or 805 million yuan, and 30 percent of the 345 million yuan in cash, according to the company’s statement to the exchange.
