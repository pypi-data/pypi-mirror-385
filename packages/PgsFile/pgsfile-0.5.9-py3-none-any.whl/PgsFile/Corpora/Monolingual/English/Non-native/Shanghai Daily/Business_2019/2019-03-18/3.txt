Qualcomm in win over Apple on chip patents 
2019-03-18
US smartphone chip titan Qualcomm has won a US$31 million verdict in its multi-front war with Apple over patented technology used in iPhones.
A jury in a federal court in Southern California ordered Apple pay Qualcomm for patent infringement for chips used on iPhone 7, 8 and X models.
The damages were tabulated from July 6, 2017 through the end of the trial, according to a Qualcomm statement on Friday.
“Today’s unanimous jury verdict is the latest victory in our worldwide patent litigation directed at holding Apple accountable for using our valuable technologies without paying for them,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a release announcing the verdict.
Patents at issue in the case involved “flashless booting” that allows devices to connect quickly to the Internet after being turned on and technology that lets smartphone apps move online data efficiently.
A third patent related to promoting rich graphics in games while protecting battery life, according to Qualcomm.
On another front in the complex legal battle between two US companies, a federal judge in Southern California on Thursday issued a preliminary ruling that Qualcomm owes Apple nearly a billion dollars in patent royalty rebate payments the chip maker is withholding, according to US media reports.
Apple sued Qualcomm two years ago over the payments. The judge’s decision will be on pause until after a trial.
