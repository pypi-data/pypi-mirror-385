Housing price warning 
2019-05-20
China’s housing regulator has alerted four Chinese cities over marked housing price rises in the past three months.
Local governments of Foshan, Suzhou, Dalian and Nanning were urged by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development to stabilize land and housing prices as well as market expectations. The ministry reiterated that “houses are for living in, not for speculation,” and called on the four cities to enhance market monitoring and analysis and address rising problems in a timely manner. New home prices rose 0.8 percent month on month in April in 31 second-tier cities and 0.5 percent in 35 third-tier cities.
