Chinese regulators have been trying to boost bank lending and lower financing costs for over a year, especially for smaller and private companies which generate a sizeable share of the country’s economic growth and jobs. 
Chinese banks usually make fewer loans in July after ramping up lending in June but the data was lower than the tally in July 2018, when banks doled out 1.45 trillion yuan in new loans.
