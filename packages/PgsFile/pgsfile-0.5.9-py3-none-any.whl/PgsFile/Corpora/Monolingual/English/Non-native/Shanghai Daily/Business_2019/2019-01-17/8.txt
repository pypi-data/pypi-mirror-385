Microsoft’s biggest lab opens here 
2019-01-17
Microsoft will set up its largest artificial intelligence and Internet of Things lab in the world in the Pudong New Area in April, the company said yesterday.
The new lab will cover 2,800 square meters in Zhangjiang, which is establishing itself as Shanghai’s AI heartland.
The lab is set to enhance deep integration of AI and IoT, and help digital transformation across industries including manufacturing, retail, health care, and the public sector.
China will begin large-scale 5G tests and trial operations this year, which will fuel development not only of telecommunications but also IoT and industrial applications, says Industry and Information Technology Minister Miao Wei.
“China has the world’s largest IoT market. The AI and IoT industry has great potential in China,” said Roan Kang, vice president of Microsoft China, adding that Microsoft would provide the most comprehensive AI and IoT platform, products and solutions.
Global computer services and software company PTC says that between now and 2026, US manufacturers need to fill almost 3.5 million manufacturing jobs — but about 2 million of these may go unfilled because of a skills gap.
AI and a connected workforce through IoT are the “answer to the manufacturing employment gap,” says PTC.
PTC has a demo center in Shanghai and offers products and services in areas such as product lifecycle management, IoT and AR.
Computer services and networking company Avnet Inc, which also operates in Shanghai, says IoT and sensors are essential technologies.
