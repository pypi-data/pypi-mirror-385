Shanghai shares closed up yesterday after the Ministry of Commerce said retail sales this year would continue growing at a steady and relatively fast pace.
The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.68 percent to close at 2,671.89 points, led by agricultural service providers, chemical enterprises and pharmaceutical companies.
The market was buoyed by Commerce Ministry official Wang Binâ€™s comments to reporters in Beijing that the country has released a series of measures to sustain retail sales growth in 2019.
An action plan released in late January set out a strategy for 10 government agencies to increase domestic consumption. The measures cover sectors such as automobiles, home appliances, the 5G high-speed mobile network and urban properties, as well as improving the environment for consumption.
Wang said that the action plan will play an important role in maintaining the good momentum of consumption this year.
