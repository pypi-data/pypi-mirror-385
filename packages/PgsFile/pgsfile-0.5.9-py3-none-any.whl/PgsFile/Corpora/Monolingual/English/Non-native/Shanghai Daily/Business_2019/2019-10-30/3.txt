City seeks gains from “spillover” 
2019-10-30
SHANGHAI will hold a meeting to introduce the city’s business environment and investment policies to overseas investors, aiming to lure more foreign capital and attract enterprises to the city.
It is scheduled during the second China International Import Expo, as an attempt to seek greater spillover benefits from the CIIE.
Nearly 1,000 people are expected to attend the meeting, including key CIIE exhibitors, multinational corporations, state-owned enterprises based in Shanghai, as well as private companies, platforms and agencies.
Authorities will focus on four key areas — the Pudong New Area, the Lingang Special Area of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, the Hongqiao Commercial Zone and the Zhangjiang National Innovation Demonstration Zone.
The meeting will also highlight the core functions and competencies of the city, as well as major progress made by MNC headquarters and the development of the city’s “five centers” and “four brands.”
“At the forefront of the reform and opening-up, Shanghai has always attached great importance to and unswervingly expanded the use of foreign capital,” said Yang Chao, deputy director of the city’s commission of commerce.
It will be held on November 6 at the International Convention Center in Pudong.
