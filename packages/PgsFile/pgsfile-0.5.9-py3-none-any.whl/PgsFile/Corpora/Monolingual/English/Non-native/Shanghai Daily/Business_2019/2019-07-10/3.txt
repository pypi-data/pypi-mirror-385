Chinese firms looking abroad 
2019-07-10
Chinese firms have speeded up overseas business expansion, covering both products and services, local firms said at a forum yesterday.
More than 30,000 overseas authors have contributed English-language contents on webnovel.com, a global online literature platform founded by Shanghai-based China Literature, the country’s biggest online reading platform. 
“Good contents and culture should have no boundary. Readers from India to South Africa can find their favorite novels on our platform, written by native writers in their own languages,” Wu Wenhui, the co-CEO of China Literature, told the WISE forum.
Relx, an e-cigarette startup, expects to expand the business to over 100 countries and regions in the future, compared with only 43 right now.
Over 81 percent of B2B’s (business to business) overseas decision makers are interested in domestic brands and willing to buy products from China. Their ideas of Chinese goods have changed to “affordable, quality and fast delivery.”
