5G technology is mutually beneficial 
2019-02-22
CHINA will grasp the development opportunities brought about by a new round of scientific and technological advances and strengthen technological exchanges and cooperation with all parties, including in 5G.
Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the comments when asked about some countries’ remarks that Chinese enterprises should be excluded from the construction of their 5G networks due to the “security risks” of Chinese products and devices.
The fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication technology is not exclusive to one or a few countries but concerns the development of the global economy, Geng said.
He was speaking ahead of the Mobile World Congress 2019 scheduled for next Monday to Thursday in Barcelona, Spain.
Geng said the global industrial chain, supply chain and value chain of 5G are highly integrated and could not be artificially separated or divested.
Trying to do this would affect “mutually beneficial and win-win multilateral cooperation, undermine the open and inclusive market environment, and damage international rules of fairness, justice and non-discrimination.”
“In the era of globalization, no country could develop independently separated from the world, and no technology could be developed or applied without cooperation,” Geng said.
China hopes all countries can make choices that conform to their own interests based on their own judgments, he added.
