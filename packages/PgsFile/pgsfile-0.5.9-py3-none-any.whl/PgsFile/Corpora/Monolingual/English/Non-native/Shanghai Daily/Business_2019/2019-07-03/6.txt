2019-07-03
CHINAâ€™S Ministry of Commerce is intensifying efforts to clean up the restrictive measures on foreign investments that are not specified on the revised negative lists, the ministry said yesterday.
The ministry will help implement the new negative lists and facilitate foreign investments through measures including cutting administrative red tape and cleaning up regulations and rules that are not in line with the foreign investment law, said Tang Wenhong, an official with the ministry.
China rolled out the revised negative lists for foreign investment market access to further cut the number of sectors, fields and businesses that are off-limits for foreign investors. The country has seen a steady inflow of foreign investment this year.
