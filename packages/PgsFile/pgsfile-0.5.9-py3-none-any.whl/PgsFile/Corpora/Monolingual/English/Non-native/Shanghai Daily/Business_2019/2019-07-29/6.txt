Trump snubs Apple 
2019-07-29
US President Donald Trump said that he would snub Apple’s requests for tariff exemptions on device components imported from China, as he puts pressure on the tech company to shift production to the United States.
“Apple will not be given Tariff wavers, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!” Trump said on Twitter.
