711 Maserati cars recalled 
2019-09-23
Italian luxury car manufacturer Maserati has begun a recall of 711 vehicles in China over defective headlight beams, according to Chinaâ€™s market regulator.
The recall involved 87 imported Levante vehicles manufactured between November 6, 2018, and March 25, 2019, and 624 Ghibli cars manufactured from July 31, 2017, to March 18, 2019. The problematic headlights may cause the angle of beams higher than the normal range, which could cause dizziness for drivers coming from the opposite direction, posing safety risks, according to a statement on the website of the State Administration for Market Regulation. 
Maserati will fix the defective parts free of charge.
