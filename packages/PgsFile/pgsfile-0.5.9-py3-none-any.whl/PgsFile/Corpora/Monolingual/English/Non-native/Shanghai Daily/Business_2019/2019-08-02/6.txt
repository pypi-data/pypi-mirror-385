2019-08-02
THE Chinese and the US negotiating teams will maintain close communication and intensify trade consultations at the work level in August to prepare for the meeting of chief trade negotiators in September, Gao Feng, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce, said yesterday.
The two sides held the 12th round of China-US high-level economic and trade consultations in Shanghai on Tuesday and Wednesday, and have agreed to hold the next round of consultations in the US in September.
Some Chinese firms, including both state-owned and private companies, have inquired with US suppliers about buying US farm produce including soybeans, cotton, pork and sorghum since July 19, Gao said. Currently, a batch of deals have been made in line with market conditions.
Responding to some US comments imposing pressure on China, Gao said the bilateral consultations must be conducted on the basis of equality and mutual respect. He expressed the hope that the US side will make positive efforts, show sincerity and goodwill, and create a good atmosphere for the consultations.
