Intel drops 5G smartphone modems 
2019-04-18
US electronics giant Intel has said it was withdrawing from the 5G smartphone modem business, hours after Apple and American microchip manufacturer Qualcomm announced they had clinched an agreement to end a battle over royalty payments.
Smartphone modems were at the center of the battle between Apple and Qualcomm.
Intel said on Tuesday it will “complete an assessment of the opportunities for 4G and 5G modems in PCs, Internet of Things devices and other data-centric devices,” while pursuing investment opportunities in its 5G network infrastructure business.
“5G continues to be a strategic priority across Intel, and our team has developed a valuable portfolio of wireless products and intellectual property,” CEO Bob Swan said in a statement. “We are assessing our options to realize the value we have created, including the opportunities in a wide variety of data-centric platforms and devices in a 5G world.”
Intel will meet commitments to customers for its 4G smartphone modem products, though it has no plans to launch 5G smartphone modem products, including those previously set to premiere in 2020.
