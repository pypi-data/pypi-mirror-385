VICE Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said on Saturday that he sees “hope” in the prospect of China-US economic and trade consultations.
“Teams from both countries are trying their best to implement the consensus reached by the two countries’ heads of state,” said Wang, also deputy China international trade representative.
The two teams have had three rounds of consultations over more than three months, he said.
Reaching a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement conforms to the interests of both countries and the world’s expectation, Wang said.
