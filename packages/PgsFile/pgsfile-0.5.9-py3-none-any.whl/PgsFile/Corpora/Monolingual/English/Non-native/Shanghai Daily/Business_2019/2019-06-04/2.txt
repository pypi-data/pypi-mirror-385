Institute membership rights restored 
2019-06-04
EMPLOYEES of Huawei Technologies have had their rights restored as members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, one of the world’s biggest technical professional organizations, according to an IEEE statement yesterday.
This includes the right to review and edit publications.
Huawei employees have had their access to IEEE publications curtailed since the US government applied export controls and restrictions to Huawei and its 68 affiliates on May 16.
“Based on new information (and clarification), employees of Huawei and its affiliates may participate as peer reviewers and editors in our publication process,” IEEE said.
The earlier polemical IEEE restriction decision was widely debated in the industry.
The organization made “unnecessary links between academia and politics,” according to an open letter issued by 10 Chinese industry organizations covering electronics, communications and automobile.
The IEEE has more than 420,000 members, more than 50 percent of whom are from outside the United States, according to its website.
