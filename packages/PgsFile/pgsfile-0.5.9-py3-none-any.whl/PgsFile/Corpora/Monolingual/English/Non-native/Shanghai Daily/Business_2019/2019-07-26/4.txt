Sun says sorry for Buffet lunch bungle 
2019-07-26
Chinese cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun issued a lengthy public apology yesterday for the manner in which he promoted his US$4.57 million charity lunch with Warren Buffett, raising questions over whether the event will ever go ahead.
Sun, 29, was scheduled to dine with the American billionaire investor yesterday in San Francisco after winning an annual auction. He said he hoped the meal would “bridge the gap between institutional and traditional investors and the realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.”
He aggressively promoted the lunch on social media only to postpone it earlier this week, saying he had fallen ill with kidney stones.
Sun denied all allegations that his businesses were involved in illegal activities and that he had been barred from foreign travel.
In Sun’s statement on his Weibo account, he said he had been immature and “over-marketed” himself and that his original good intentions had resulted in unexpected consequences that led him to neglect his responsibilities.
“This has resulted in a bad influence on the public and incited the worries of the regulatory bodies which care for me,” he said. Sun did not say what prompted the apology, or if the lunch would be rescheduled.
