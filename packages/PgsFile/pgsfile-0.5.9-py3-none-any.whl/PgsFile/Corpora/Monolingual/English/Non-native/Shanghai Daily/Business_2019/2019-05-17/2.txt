2019-05-17
Shanghai Mobile has started selecting people to participate in 5G trials, offering Internet connection up to 50 times faster than current mobile Internet access.
The participants, the first in the country, will get a free 5G phone, SIM card and mobile data allowance and will give feedback on their experiences, according to China Mobile, the leading mobile carrier in the city with more than 25 million subscribers. China has not yet issued 5G licenses but 5G networks already cover major cities, including Shanghai.
