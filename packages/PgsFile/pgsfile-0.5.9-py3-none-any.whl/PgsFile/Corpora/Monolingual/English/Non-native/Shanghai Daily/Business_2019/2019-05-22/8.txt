Company victim of bullying by US administration 
2019-05-22
CHINESE giant Huawei denounced what it called “US bullying” yesterday and warned Europeans against “complacent appeasement” of Washington’s move to block its access to markets and technology.
Abraham Liu, Huawei’s envoy in Brussels, played up what he said were his firm’s common interests with Europe and pledged to go the “extra mile” to ease EU security concerns over rolling out 5G technology.
“Now Huawei is becoming the victim of the bullying by the US administration,” Liu told the media. “This is not just an attack against Huawei. It is an attack on the liberal, rules-based order. This is dangerous.
“If we shut our eyes, what will be the likely consequences of such a complacent appeasement in the future?”
Liu stressed his company’s nearly 20-year presence in Europe, its employment of 12,200 people, most of them hired locally, and its key role in advancing European economic interests.
