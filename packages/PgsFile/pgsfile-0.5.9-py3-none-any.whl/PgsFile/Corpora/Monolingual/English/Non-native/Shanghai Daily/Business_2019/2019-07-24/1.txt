Investors to be protected 
2019-07-24
The Shanghai Financial Court will protect investors involved in cases related to STAR Market by expanding the range of entities that can apply for investigation, according to a guideline issued by the court yesterday.
   Agencies working with securities investors will be allowed to file applications in court, instead of just lawyers. Those refusing to assist the writ holder after getting evidence, the court will hand out civil punishment. “That can help investors get the evidence needed,” said Xiao Kai, deputy head of the court. “We will use the online platform to simplify procedures and reduce costs.”
    Xiao said on disputes over information disclosure that they will give tougher penalties but will also consider the negative influence it may bring to the listed companies’ business.
