Maritime industry exhibition in city 
2019-08-23
Marintec China 2019, an international gathering of the maritime industry, will be held from December 3-6 at the Shanghai New International Expo Center in the Pudong New Area.
The exhibition has been held every two years in Shanghai since 1979. This year, the exhibition will highlight 5G in shipbuilding and navigation.
Xing Wenhua, chairman of Marintec China 2019, said it has been a tough year for the industry as the turnover of new ship trading in the first half of year declined over 50 percent from the same period of last year.
“But thanks to the development of new technologies and international regulations, the market is still keen to see the exhibition,” said Xing.
“We are expecting more than 2,100 companies from all over the world and 65,000 trade visitors which will both set a new record.”
Xing said intelligent navigation, green technology and luxury cruise liners will be the highlights of the exhibition.
Also, for the first time, the exhibition will have a section on interior decoration for luxury cruise liners, offering visitors the chance to try out entertainment and lounge services.
Amid the overall decline of ship trading, the volume of luxury cruise liner trading remained high, said Xing.
By the end of June this year, the total turnover of cruise trading this year was about US$50 billion, he said.
