2019-05-08
CHINESE Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States this week for trade talks, China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed yesterday.
Liu will be in the United States tomorrow and on Friday.
The ministry did not elaborate on the topics for discussion.
Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing yesterday that mutual respect was the basis for reaching a trade agreement.
“Adding tariffs can’t resolve any problem,” Geng said.
“Talks are by their nature a process of discussion. It’s normal for both sides to have differences. China won’t shun problems and is sincere about continuing talks,” he said.
“We hope the US side can work hard with China, to meet each other halfway, and on the basis of mutual respect and equality, resolve each other’s reasonable concerns, and strive for a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement.”
