2019-11-20
Shanghai will throw open more public data this year as the city aims to speed up smart city construction, government officials said yesterday.
Shanghai has launched a city-level public data platform, covering finance, health care, tourism, energy, urban management and transport data.
Currently, Shanghai has 2,100 packages of public data out in the open â€” that number will rise to 4,000 by the end of 2019, local officials said.
Shanghai will particularly focus on four sectors of public data in the next stage, namely finance, health care, transport and culture and tourism.
Nationwide, Shanghai has a leading position and unique advantages to promote data opening, said Wu Qing, vice mayor of Shanghai.
In 2012, Shanghai started opening certain sectors of public data.
And since 2017, it has become the top city nationwide on opening up on public data.
