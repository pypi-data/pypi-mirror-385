Mercedes factory opened in Russia 
2019-04-04
Germany’s Daimler AG has opened a new Mercedes factory in Russia, part of a 250-million-euro (US$281 million) investment it says will create 1,000 jobs.
CEO Dieter Zetsche said yesterday the Moscow-area plant will produce Mercedes sedans and SUVs for the local market, and is part of a strategy to move production closer to customers.
The opening was attended by German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who also was meeting President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials on a two-day visit. Ministry spokeswoman Annika Einhorn said the trip aimed to address “opportunities and challenges for German business in Russia.”
Germany stressed the visit didn’t signal a return to business as usual. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman said Germany’s position on sanctions over Russia’s actions in Ukraine hasn’t changed.
