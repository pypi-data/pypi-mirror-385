A MEETING was held yesterday to match equipment exhibitors with buyers ahead of November’s second China International Import Expo.
The session brought together more than 200 exhibitors and buyers, including 95 overseas exhibitors from countries and regions including the United States, Germany, Japan, Italy and Switzerland.
Leading companies such as General Electric, Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp, Jungheinrich AG, ABB, Dell Inc, Schneider and Nokia were introduced to buyers and match them up for sales or partnerships.
Representatives from central enterprises including China Railway and the China National Pharmaceutical Group Co (Sinopharm), China’s industry leaders such as Xiaomi Technology and Vitasoy, as well as medical institutions Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and the Hospital of Xi’an Jiao Tong University, were among the buyers.
Liu Fuxue, deputy director of the China International Import Expo Bureau, said at the meeting that the focus of preparatory work for the second CIIE has shifted from attracting exhibitors to seeking buyers and organizing the expo, and holding pre-expo meetings for exhibitors and buyers was an important part of the preparatory work. 
The meetings help exhibitors and buyers understand each other and strengthen communications.
