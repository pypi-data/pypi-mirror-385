Thai Air chief quits 
2019-11-04
Thai Airways has said its chairman has resigned as the carrier struggles with financial challenges. The airline said on Friday Ekniti Nitithanprapas had resigned effective immediately. Vice chairman and Air Chief Marshal Chaiyapruk Didyasarin will be acting chairman. Thai Airways gave no reason for Eknitiâ€™s departure. He  recently drew criticism for saying the company was in crisis and might have to close. The company reported a nearly 6.7 billion baht (US$220 million) net loss during April and June, saying a slowdown in tourism in Thailand and in the global aviation market were factors behind a 10 percent decline in revenue.
