Duffy makes maiden voyage 
2019-08-14
A NEW aircraft depicting Duffy and Friends made its maiden flight on Monday in celebration of the upcoming Duffy Month, scheduled for September at Shanghai Disney Resort.
The new airplane marks the fourth Disney-themed aircraft to join the companyâ€™s fleet as part of its partnership with Shanghai Disney Resort, following the Disney Pixar Toy Story Land themed Toy Story Happy Holiday Express, which was launched last spring.
Created in Tokyo DisneySea, Duffy the Disney Bear is a teddy bear that was hand-sewn by Minnie Mouse and given to Mickey as a companion for his many ocean voyages.
A series of Duffy-themed events both at the airport and in-flight were also introduced. The images of Duffy and his friends can be seen everywhere from cushion covers to luggage containers. 
The Duffy-themed airplane is mainly for domestic routes.
