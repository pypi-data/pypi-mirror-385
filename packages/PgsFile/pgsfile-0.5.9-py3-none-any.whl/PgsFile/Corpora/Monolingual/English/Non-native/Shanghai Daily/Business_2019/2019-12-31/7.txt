Fuel prices to go up from today 
2019-12-31
China will raise the retail prices of gasoline and diesel from today, the country’s top economic planner said yesterday.
Based on recent changes in international oil prices, the retail prices of gasoline and diesel will rise by 235 yuan (US$33.67) and 230 yuan per ton, respectively, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.
Under the current pricing mechanism, if international crude oil prices change by more than 50 yuan per ton and remain at that level for 10 working days, the prices of refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel in China will be adjusted.
China’s three biggest oil companies, namely China National Petroleum Corporation, China Petrochemical Corporation and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, have been asked to maintain oil production and facilitate transportation to ensure stable supplies.
