Tencent moves to protect child players 
2019-04-23
Tencent said yesterday it will keep children under 16 out of its targeted customers for online gaming, using real-name verification.
Online gaming has been criticized as a cause of nearsightedness and over-indulgence in electric devices among children. The company’s move is targeted to help parents more effectively manage their kids’ online behavior.
Last month, Tencent rolled out a child-lock mode. Children under 13 need their parent’s permission before unlocking and logging into the game.
This month, Tencent had installed checks in 53 mobile games and 11 PC games to restrict the amount of time kids spend playing. In games reinforced with the system, children under the age of 12 are only allocated one hour a day and are not allowed to play from 9pm to 8am the next day.
