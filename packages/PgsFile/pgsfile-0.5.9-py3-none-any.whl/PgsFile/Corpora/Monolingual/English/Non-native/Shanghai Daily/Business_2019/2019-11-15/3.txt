2019-11-15
The security department of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said on Wednesday that it had intercepted 2.2 billion network attacks in 24 hours during the Singles Day online shopping spree. 
The hostile attacks included network traffic attacks, hacker attacks and unfair scalping. More than 3,000 security specialists and 1,258 algorithm models worked 24 hours straight on November 11 to block the attacks, the company said. Jessie Zheng, chief risk officer responsible for data and information security across Alibabaâ€™s platforms, said the company has made efforts to prevent and control risks not only by identifying counterfeit goods and malicious complaints but identifying abnormal transactions.
