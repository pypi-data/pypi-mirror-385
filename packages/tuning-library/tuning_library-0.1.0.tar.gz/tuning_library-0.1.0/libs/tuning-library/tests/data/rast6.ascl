! Long description: This represents a version of Maqam Rast with a wide range of choices of pitch variants. Four potential choices for an E1/2♭ (the 3rd scale degree of Rast) are given, ranging from a relatively low version typical of later-20th-century Egypt, to a relatively high version typical of mid-20th century Syria, and two choices in between. Two possible choices for B1/2♭ (the 7th scale degree of Rast) are included. It is typical in maqam Rast to use a B1/2♭ relatively higher than the E1/2♭. Two choices of B♭ are given, because of the preference for a very low B♭ in Jins Nahawand on G, lower than the Pythagorean B♭ used for Bayati and Saba G. In addition, because of the inclusion of versions of E♭, E1/2♭, E♮, A♭, A1/2♭, A♮, B♭, B1/2♭, and B♮, all of the common modulations within the Maqam Rast family are possible. This version of Maqam Rast was developed by Sami Abu Shumays. Visit the website to learn more.
