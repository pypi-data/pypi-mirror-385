The pelog Liwung scale has five notes taken from the seven-tone Pelog scale. This version is based on the tuning of a to-be-named gamelan tuned in a Javanese style. This scale is referred to as Pelog Da = Galimer with the pitch order: S-G-U-L-T. If using a MIDI piano controller, we recommend setting "Black Keys Only" in the Track Tuning MIDI Controller Layout.
