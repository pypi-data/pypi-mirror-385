class Ultrasonic:
    """
    This class measures distance using the ultrasonic sensor `HC-SR04` to
    provide distance measurements from 2 cm to 400 cm, with a ranging accuracy
    that can reach up to 3 mm.

    Each HC-SR04 module consists of an ultrasonic transmitter, a receiver, and a control circuit.

    Principle of Operation:
    --------------

    1. Triggering the Sensor:
       - Send a high level to the `trig` (trigger) pin for at least 10 microseconds.
       - This initiates the module to send ultrasonic pulses at a frequency of 40 kHz.

    2. Sending and Receiving Pulses:
       - The transmitter emits the ultrasonic pulses and the receiver waits to
         detect the reflected pulses from any obstacle in the range.

    3. Calculating Distance:
       - If an obstacle is detected, the module sets a low level on the `echo` pin for 150 milliseconds.
       - Calculate the distance to the obstacle using the formula:

    Formula
    --------------
    ```
    distance = (time * sound_velocity) / 2
    ```
    Here, `time` is the measured pulse duration, and `sound velocity` is near 343.3 meters/second.

    Pin Configuration:
    --------------
    - `VCC`: Power supply (typically connected to 5V).
    - `Trig`: Trigger input (required by this class).
    - `Echo`: Echo output (required by this class).
    - `GND`: Ground (typically connected to ground).
