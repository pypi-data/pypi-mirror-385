    """
    This implementation provides a unified and abstracted motor control that relies on an external PWM driver.
    The motor is driven by a separate digital output pin for direction control and uses a PWM driverâ€”adhering
    to the PWMDriverABC interface - to provide a variable speed control signal.

    Use Case:
      - Ideal for hardware setups where a dedicated PWM driver (e.g., PCA9685, SunfounderPWM) is used to control
        motor speed via IÂ²C or another bus.
      - Both direction and speed are decoupled from low-level hardware details, enabling greater flexibility
        and resolution. The motor speed is controlled by a duty cycle, and the underlying driver sets the PWM
        frequency.
      - This approach is common for H-bridge motor implementations that leverage external PWM chips.

    Example wiring:
      - A digital output pin controls the motor's direction.
      - A PWM driver channel (provided via a PWMDriverABC implementation) is used to control motor speed.
      - No direct PWM initialization via GPIO is required; instead, the driver is configured with its bus address.
