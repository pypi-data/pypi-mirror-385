Draw.io Images
--------------

When working with diagrams created using Draw.io, it's important to ensure that the images retain their embedded metadata. This metadata allows the diagrams to be re-uploaded to Draw.io later for editing.

To preserve this metadata:

- When exporting from Draw.io, use the "File > Export As > PNG (with embedded XML)" or SVG (with embedded content) option.
- Make sure the "Include a copy of my diagram" or similar checkbox is selected during export.

This ensures that the image isn't just a flat graphicâ€”it includes the necessary data for Draw.io to reconstruct and edit the diagram later.

Tip: There is a chance of losing the metadata though if not handled properly. Sharing the image through Slack for example will delete the metadata associated with the image. Instead, use something like e-mail.
