How the documentation is structured
-----------------------------------

The documentation consists of a Developer Guide for MX-Bluesky, which also includes documentation for Hyperion. At its current stage in development, there is no user guide.

        The Developer Guide contains documentation on how to install, develop and contribute changes to MX-Bluesky; explanations about the purpose of the software and some of the technical concepts; as well as how-to guides and tutorials.
