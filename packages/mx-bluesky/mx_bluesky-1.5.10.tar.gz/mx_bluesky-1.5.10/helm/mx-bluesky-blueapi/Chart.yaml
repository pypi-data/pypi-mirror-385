description: A helm chart deploying a worker pod that runs Bluesky plans

# This chart provides extra configuration to a BlueAPI application which is generic to all MX beamlines,
# and does not startup an application by itself. A BlueAPI service in ixx-services should add this chart
# as a dependency. It currently mounts zocalo and ispyb credentials as config maps, with the assumption 
# that the beamline cluster have these secrets available. In the future, this helmchart may change to a 
# library type
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
# This is updated automatically by CI, the appVersion is automatically inserted by CI
version: 0.1.1
