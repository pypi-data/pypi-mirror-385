# Async Substrate Interface
This project provides an asynchronous interface for interacting with [Substrate](https://substrate.io/)-based blockchains. It is based on the [py-substrate-interface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface) project.

Additionally, this project uses [bt-decode](https://github.com/opentensor/bt-decode) instead of [py-scale-codec](https://github.com/polkascan/py-scale-codec) for faster [SCALE](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/) decoding.

## Installation

To install the package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install async-substrate-interface
```

## Usage

Here are examples of how to use the sync and async inferfaces:

```python
from async_substrate_interface import SubstrateInterface

def main():
    substrate = SubstrateInterface(
        url="wss://rpc.polkadot.io"
    )
    with substrate:
        result = substrate.query(
            module='System',
            storage_function='Account',
            params=['5CZs3T15Ky4jch1sUpSFwkUbYEnsCfe1WCY51fH3SPV6NFnf']
        )

        print(result)

main()
```

```python
import asyncio
from async_substrate_interface import AsyncSubstrateInterface

async def main():
    substrate = AsyncSubstrateInterface(
        url="wss://rpc.polkadot.io"
    )
    async with substrate:
        result = await substrate.query(
            module='System',
            storage_function='Account',
            params=['5CZs3T15Ky4jch1sUpSFwkUbYEnsCfe1WCY51fH3SPV6NFnf']
        )

        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Caching
There are a few different cache types used in this library to improve the performance overall. The one with which
you are probably familiar is the typical `functools.lru_cache` used in `sync_substrate.SubstrateInterface`.

By default, it uses a max cache size of 512 for smaller returns, and 16 for larger ones. These cache sizes are 
user-configurable using the respective env vars, `SUBSTRATE_CACHE_METHOD_SIZE` and `SUBSTRATE_RUNTIME_CACHE_SIZE`.

They are applied only on methods whose results cannot change â€” such as the block hash for a given block number 
(small, 512 default), or the runtime for a given runtime version (large, 16 default).

Additionally, in `AsyncSubstrateInterface`, because of its asynchronous nature, we developed our own asyncio-friendly 
LRU caches. The primary one is the `CachedFetcher` which wraps the same methods as `functools.lru_cache` does in 
`SubstrateInterface`, but the key difference here is that each request is assigned a future that is returned when the 
initial request completes. So, if you were to do:

```python
bn = 5000
bh1, bh2 = await asyncio.gather(
    asi.get_block_hash(bn),
    asi.get_block_hash(bn)
)
```
it would actually only make one single network call, and return the result to both requests. Like `SubstrateInterface`,
it also takes the `SUBSTRATE_CACHE_METHOD_SIZE` and `SUBSTRATE_RUNTIME_CACHE_SIZE` vars to set cache size.

The third and final caching mechanism we use is `async_substrate_interface.async_substrate.DiskCachedAsyncSubstrateInterface`,
which functions the same as the normal `AsyncSubstrateInterface`, but that also saves this cache to the disk, so the cache
is preserved between runs. This is product for a fairly nice use-case (such as `btcli`). As you may call different networks
with entirely different results, this cache is keyed by the uri supplied at instantiation of the `DiskCachedAsyncSubstrateInterface`
object, so `DiskCachedAsyncSubstrateInterface(network_1)` and `DiskCachedAsyncSubstrateInterface(network_2)` will not share
the same on-disk cache.

As with the other two caches, this also takes `SUBSTRATE_CACHE_METHOD_SIZE` and `SUBSTRATE_RUNTIME_CACHE_SIZE` env vars.


### ENV VARS
The following environment variables are used within async-substrate-interface
 - NO_CACHE (default 0): if set to 1, when using the DiskCachedAsyncSubstrateInterface class, no persistent on-disk cache will be stored, instead using only in-memory cache.
 - CACHE_LOCATION (default `~/.cache/async-substrate-interface`): this determines the location for the cache file, if using DiskCachedAsyncSubstrateInterface
 - SUBSTRATE_CACHE_METHOD_SIZE (default 512): the cache size (either in-memory or on-disk) of the smaller return-size methods (see the Caching section for more info)
 - SUBSTRATE_RUNTIME_CACHE_SIZE (default 16): the cache size (either in-memory or on-disk) of the larger return-size methods (see the Caching section for more info)
