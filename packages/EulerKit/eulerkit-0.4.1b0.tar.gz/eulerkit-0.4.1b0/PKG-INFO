This is a Python Library inspired by the functions that are needed to solve many Project Euler problems. It also includes some utilities that I personally enjoy very much.

Here is a (non-comprehensive) list of features that are in the library:
- Palindromes 
    - The ability to verify if a number is a palindrome
- Prime Generation
    - The ability to generate a large set of prime numbers - to a list or to a file if you want to pre-generate them.
- Pandigital
    - The ability to verify if a number is pandigital or not

### Quickstart:
You can install the library by running this simple command:

`pip install EulerKit`

From there you can begin using the library immediately by importing it at the top of your python projects like this:

```python
from EulerKit import*
```
