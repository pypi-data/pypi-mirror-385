Spectral _estimators
======================
This package contains methods that can be used to create a 2D spectrum from Fourier moments. Specifically, it contains
methods to construct a frequency direction spectrum given the first and second directional Fourier moments
(a1,b1,a2,b2) and the frequency spectrum. Core functionality is provided by the
`estimate_directional_spectrum_from_moments` function.
