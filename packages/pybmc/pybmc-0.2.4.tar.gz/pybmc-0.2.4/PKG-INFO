# pyBMC: A General Bayesian Model Combination Package

[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-86%25-brightgreen)](https://ascsn.github.io/pybmc/coverage/)

pyBMC is a Python package for performing Bayesian Model Combination (BMC) on various predictive models. It provides tools for data handling, orthogonalization, Gibbs sampling, and prediction with uncertainty quantification. The model combination methodology follows [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033266) by Giuliani et al.

## Features

- **Data Management**: Load and preprocess nuclear mass data from HDF5 and CSV files
- **Orthogonalization**: Transform model predictions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Bayesian Inference**: Perform Gibbs sampling for model combination
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Generate predictions with credible intervals
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculate coverage statistics for model validation

## Installation

```bash
pip install pybmc
```

## Quick Start

For a detailed walkthrough of how to use the package, please see the [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md).

## Development and Testing

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and packaging. Poetry is **not required** for regular users who install via `pip install pybmc`, but is needed for development and testing.

### Running Tests

If you want to run the test suite:

**Option 1: Using Poetry (recommended for development)**
```bash
# Install Poetry if you don't have it
pip install poetry

# Install the package with dev dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=pybmc
```

**Option 2: Using pytest directly**
```bash
# Install pytest and other test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=pybmc
```
