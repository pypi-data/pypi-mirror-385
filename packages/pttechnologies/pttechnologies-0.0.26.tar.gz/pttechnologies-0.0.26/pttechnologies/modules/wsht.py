"""
Test Apache Web Server detection via differential access to .ht* files.

This module provides a test that attempts to detect an Apache web server by
sending HTTP requests to `.hh` and `.ht` paths on the target URL and comparing
their responses. Apache servers typically restrict access to `.ht*` files
using `.htaccess` rules, so differing response status codes can reveal
the presence of Apache.

Contains:
- WSHT class for performing the detection test.
- run() function as an entry point for running the test.

Usage:
    WSHT(args, ptjsonlib, helpers, http_client, responses).run()
