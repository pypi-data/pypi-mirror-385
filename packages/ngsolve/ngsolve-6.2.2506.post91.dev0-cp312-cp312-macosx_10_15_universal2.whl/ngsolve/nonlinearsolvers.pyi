        Newton's method for solving non-linear problems of the form A(u)=0.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : BilinearForm
          The BilinearForm of the non-linear variational problem. It does not have to be assembled.
    
        u : GridFunction
          The GridFunction where the solution is saved. The values are used as initial guess for Newton's method.
    
        freedofs : BitArray
          The FreeDofs on which the assembled matrix is inverted. If argument is 'None' then the FreeDofs of the underlying FESpace is used.
    
        maxit : int
          Number of maximal iteration for Newton. If the maximal number is reached before the maximal error Newton might no converge and a warning is displayed.
    
        maxerr : float
          The maximal error which Newton should reach before it stops. The error is computed by the square root of the inner product of the residuum and the correction.
    
        inverse : string
          A string of the sparse direct solver which should be solved for inverting the assembled Newton matrix.
    
        dampfactor : float
          Set the damping factor for Newton's method. If dampfactor is 1 then no damping is done. If value is < 1 then the damping is done by the formula 'min(1,dampfactor*numit)' for the correction, where 'numit' denotes the Newton iteration.
    
        printing : bool
          Set if Newton's method should print informations about the actual iteration like the error. 
    
        Returns
        -------
        (int, int)
          List of two integers. The first one is 0 if Newton's method did converge, -1 otherwise. The second one gives the number of Newton iterations needed.

        linesearch : bool
          If True then linesearch is used to guarantee that the energy decreases in every Newton iteration.
    
        printing : bool
          Set if Newton's method should print informations about the actual iteration like the error.
