Vibdata is an open-source repository that provides a common interface for developers to manipulate vibrational data . It uses a Python package to store and manipulate data, aiming to facilitate the development of machine learning techniques in the context of intelligent fault diagnosis for rotating machinery.

## Paper Versions

For reproducibility purposes, specific versions of this repository were used in published papers:

- For the exact code used in **Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing** paper, see tag `mssp-similarity-bias-v1` ([GitHub Release](https://github.com/ivarejao/vibdata/releases/tag/mssp-similarity-bias-v1))
- For the exact code used in **International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management** paper, see tag `ijphm-towards-vibnet-v1` ([GitHub Release](https://github.com/ivarejao/vibdata/releases/tag/ijphm-towards-vibnet-v1))


## Features

- Provides a unified interface for handling vibrational data
- Includes five public datasets: 
    - CWRU - Case Western Reserve University Bearing Dataset;
    - IMS - Intelligent Maintenance System Bearing Dataset;
    - UOC - University of Connecticut Gearbox Dataset;
    - PU - Padeborn University Bearing Dataset ;
    - MFPT - Machinery Failure Prevention Technology Bearing Dataset;
    - HUST - Huazhong University of Science and Technology Bearing Dataset;
    - UORED - University of Ottawa Rolling-element Bearing Dataset.
- Divided into two main modules:
  - `raw`: Structures datasets into classes for easy and practical data manipulation
  - `deep`: Offers a lazy implementation compatible with deep learning frameworks, especially PyTorch

## Installation
Installing Vibdata is quick and easy! Just follow these simple steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system*.
2. Install Vibdata using pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ivarejao/vibdata.git
```
That's it! You're now ready to start using Vibdata in your projects.

> Note: Vibdata requires Python version 3.10 or later, but is not yet compatible with Python 3.12. Please ensure your Python version is within this range for optimal performance.

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Vibdata:

```python
from vibdata.raw import MFPT_raw

root_dir = "MY_DATASET_DIR"  # Where to save and load datasets
D = MFPT_raw(root_dir, download=True)  # Downloads the dataset if not available

print(D.getMetaInfo())  # Prints metainfo of the dataset
print("Number of signals:", len(D))

# Get the temporal signal and the respectively sample rate
signal = D[0]
signal_metainfo = D.getMetaInfo().iloc[0]
print("Length of signal:", len(signal))
print("Signal sample rate:", signal_metainfo["sample_rate"])
```

## Transformations

Vibdata provides common transformations used in machinery signal processing. You can implement new transformations using the `Transformer` interface, which is compatible with scikit-learn pipelines.


Example of using transformations:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from vibdata.raw import MFPT_raw
from vibdata.deep.signal.transforms import Split, FFT, FilterByValue, asType
from vibdata.deep.DeepDataset import convertDataset

transforms = make_pipeline(
    FilterByValue(on_field='sample_rate', values=48828),
    Split(1024),
    FFT(),
    asType(np.float32, on_field='signal'),
)

root_dir = "MY_DATASET_DIR"
D = MFPT_raw(root_dir, download=True)
D_transformed = convertDataset(dataset=D, transforms=transforms, dir_path=root_dir)
print(D_transformed[3]['signal'].shape)
```
