# SIS Unified Object Underarmor

Good morning, my brother! Welcome **SUOU** (**S**IS **U**nified **O**bject **U**nderarmor), the Python library which speeds up and makes it pleasing to develop API, database schemas and stuff in Python.

It provides utilities such as:
* [SIQ](https://yusur.moe/protocols/siq.html)
* signing and generation of access tokens, on top of [ItsDangerous](https://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous)
* helpers for use in Flask, SQLAlchemy, and other popular frameworks
* i forgor 💀

**It is not an ORM** nor a replacement of it; it works along existing ORMs (currently only SQLAlchemy is supported lol).

## Installation

**Python 3.10**+ with Pip is required.

```bash
$ pip install sakuragasaki46-suou
```

To install optional dependencies (i.e. `sqlalchemy`) for development use:

```bash
$ pip install sakuragasaki46-suou[sqlalchemy]
```

Please note that you probably already have those dependencies, if you just use the library.

## Features

...

## Support

Just a heads up: SUOU was made to support Sakuragasaki46 (me)'s own selfish, egoistic needs. Not to provide a service to the public.

As a consequence, 'add this add that' stuff is best-effort.

Expect breaking changes, disruptive renames in bugfix releases, sudden deprecations, years of unmantainment, or sudden removal of SUOU from GH or pip.

Don't want to depend on my codebase for moral reasons (albeit unrelated)? It's fine. I did not ask you.

**DO NOT ASK TO MAKE SUOU SAFE FOR CHILDREN**. Enjoy having your fingers cut.

Happy hacking.
