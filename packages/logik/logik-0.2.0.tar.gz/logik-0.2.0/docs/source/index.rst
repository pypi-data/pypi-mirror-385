Logik Demo Edition
==================

Welcome to the demo edition of Logik.  In this edition, the following features are showcased:

* RTL to bitstream automation flow for FPGA/eFPGA architectures, powered by `Silicon Compiler <https://www.siliconcompiler.com>`_
* Integration with logiklib, a catalog repository of FPGA/eFPGA architectures

* Example designs for reference in adopting the flow
* Documentation providing step-by-step guidance for setup and execution of the flow
