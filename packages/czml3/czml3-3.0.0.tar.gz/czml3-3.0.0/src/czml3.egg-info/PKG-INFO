From the official [CZML Guide](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer/wiki/CZML-Guide):
> CZML is a JSON format for describing a time-dynamic graphical scene, primarily for display in a web browser running Cesium. It describes lines, points, billboards, models, and other graphical primitives, and specifies how they change with time.

czml3 aims to make the process of writing CZML files in Python easy by:
- Type checking properties
- Cooercion of data to their required format
- Forbidding unrecognised properties
- Creating minimal CZML files
- Performant JSON serialisation

## Insallation
You can install czml3 using pip:
```
pip install czml3
```

or conda:
```
conda install czml3 --channel conda-forge
```

## Examples
A CZML document is a list of *packets*, which have several properties. Recreating the blue box from Cesium sandcastle's [CZML Box](https://sandcastle.cesium.com/?src=CZML%20Box.html&label=CZML):

```
from czml3 import CZML_VERSION, Document, Packet
from czml3.properties import (
    Box,
    BoxDimensions,
    Color,
    Material,
    Position,
    SolidColorMaterial,
)
from czml3.types import Cartesian3Value
packet_box = Packet(
    id="my_id",
    position=Position(cartographicDegrees=[-114.0, 40.0, 300000.0]),
    box=Box(
        dimensions=BoxDimensions(
            cartesian=Cartesian3Value(values=[400000.0, 300000.0, 500000.0])
        ),
        material=Material(
            solidColor=SolidColorMaterial(color=Color(rgba=[0, 0, 255, 255]))
        ),
    ),
)
doc = Document(
    packets=[Packet(id="document", name="box", version=CZML_VERSION), packet_box]
)
print(doc)
```
```
[
    {
        "id": "document",
        "name": "box",
        "version": "1.0"
    },
    {
        "id": "my_id",
        "position": {
            "cartographicDegrees": [
                -114.0,
                40.0,
                300000.0
            ]
        },
        "box": {
            "dimensions": {
                "cartesian": [
                    400000.0,
                    300000.0,
                    500000.0
                ]
            },
            "material": {
                "solidColor": {
                    "color": {
                        "rgba": [
                            0.0,
                            0.0,
                            255.0,
                            255.0
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

czml3 uses [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for all classes. As such czml3 is able to [coerce data to their right type](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/why/#json-schema). For example, the following creates a Position property of doubles using a numpy array of interger type:
```
import numpy as np
from czml3.properties import Position
print(Position(cartographicDegrees=np.array([-114, 40, 300000], dtype=int)))
```
```
{
    "cartographicDegrees": [
        -114.0,
        40.0,
        300000.0
    ]
}
```

## Contributing
You want to contribute? Awesome! There are lots of [CZML properties](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer/wiki/Packet) and validations that we still did not implement, which can be found [here](https://czml3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/contributing.html).

All ideas welcome!
