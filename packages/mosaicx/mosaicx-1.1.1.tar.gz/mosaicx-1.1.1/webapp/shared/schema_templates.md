## ðŸ“Š Usage Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic schemas and add complexity
2. **Medical Terminology**: Use standard medical terms for better results  
3. **Validation Constraints**: The AI will automatically add appropriate field validations
4. **Field Descriptions**: Each generated field will have descriptive help text

## ðŸŽ¯ Model Recommendations

- **Complex schemas**: Use `gpt-oss:120b` for best accuracy
- **Quick testing**: Use `llama3.1:8b-instruct` for faster generation
- **Batch processing**: Use `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` for efficiency
