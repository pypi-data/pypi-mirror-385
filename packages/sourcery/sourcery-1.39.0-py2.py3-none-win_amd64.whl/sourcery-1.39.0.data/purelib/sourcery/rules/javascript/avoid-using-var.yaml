  description: Use `const` or `let` instead of `var`.
  explanation: |
    `const` is preferred as it ensures you cannot reassign references (which can lead to buggy and confusing code).
    `let` may be used if you need to reassign references - it's preferred to `var` because it is block- rather than
    function-scoped.
