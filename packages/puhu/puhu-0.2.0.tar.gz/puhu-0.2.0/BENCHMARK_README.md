# Puhu vs Pillow Comprehensive Benchmark

## Overview

`benchmark_comprehensive.py` is a complete benchmarking script that compares Puhu with Pillow (PIL) across all API methods, performance metrics, and features.

## Features

### 1. **API Compatibility Testing**
- ‚úÖ Module-level functions (open, new, save, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Image instance methods (resize, crop, rotate, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Properties (size, width, height, mode, format, info)
- ‚úÖ Color modes (L, LA, RGB, RGBA, 1, P, CMYK, YCbCr, LAB, HSV, I, F)
- ‚úÖ Image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, WEBP, ICO)

### 2. **Unsupported Methods Report**
Lists all Pillow methods that are not implemented in Puhu, organized by category:
- Core Operations
- Pixel Access
- Image Manipulation
- Filters & Effects
- Format & Info
- Creation Methods
- Properties

### 3. **Performance Benchmarks**
Measures and compares execution time for common operations:
- Image loading
- Resize operations
- Crop operations
- Rotate operations
- Convert operations
- Copy operations
- Save operations

Tests are run on multiple image sizes (100x100, 500x500, 1000x1000) for comprehensive performance analysis.

## Usage

### Installation

First, ensure both libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install puhu pillow
```

### Running the Benchmark

```bash
python benchmark_comprehensive.py
```

Or make it executable and run directly:

```bash
chmod +x benchmark_comprehensive.py
./benchmark_comprehensive.py
```

## Output Sections

### 1. Module-Level Functions
Shows which module functions are available in both libraries.

### 2. Image Instance Methods
Comprehensive comparison of all Image class methods, organized by category:
- Core Operations (save, resize, crop, rotate, etc.)
- Pixel Access (getpixel, putpixel, etc.)
- Image Manipulation (paste, split, merge, etc.)
- Filters & Effects (filter, histogram, etc.)
- Format & Info (load, verify, etc.)
- Creation Methods (fromarray, frombytes, etc.)
- Properties (size, width, height, etc.)

### 3. Color Mode Support
Tests all Pillow color modes:
- **Supported in Puhu**: L, LA, RGB, RGBA, 1, P
- **Not supported**: CMYK, YCbCr, LAB, HSV, I, F

### 4. Image Format Support
Tests read/write support for common formats:
- PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, WEBP: ‚úÖ Fully supported
- ICO: ‚úÖ Read-only

### 5. Unsupported Methods
Detailed list of 42 Pillow methods not yet implemented in Puhu.

### 6. Performance Benchmarks
Side-by-side timing comparison with speedup/slowdown metrics.

### 7. Summary
Overall assessment with:
- Basic operations coverage percentage
- Status rating (EXCELLENT/GOOD/FAIR/LIMITED)
- Recommendations for when to use Puhu vs Pillow
- Version information

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Puhu Strengths
- **100% core operations coverage** - All essential image operations work
- **Drop-in replacement** for basic image processing tasks
- **All major formats supported** - PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, WEBP
- **Memory-safe** Rust implementation
- **Production-ready** for common use cases

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Puhu Limitations
- **27.6% method coverage** (16/58 methods)
- **42 unsupported methods** including:
  - Advanced pixel manipulation (getpixel, putpixel)
  - Image composition (paste, blend, composite)
  - Filters and effects
  - Exotic color modes (CMYK, LAB, HSV)
  
### üìä Performance Notes
Performance varies by operation and image size. Puhu's lazy loading architecture may show different characteristics than Pillow's eager loading.

## Recommendations

### Use Puhu when:
- ‚úÖ Doing basic image operations (resize, crop, rotate, convert)
- ‚úÖ Format conversion (JPEG ‚Üî PNG ‚Üî WEBP, etc.)
- ‚úÖ You need memory safety guarantees
- ‚úÖ Working with standard color modes (RGB, RGBA, L, LA)

### Use Pillow when:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You need pixel-level manipulation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced filters and effects are required
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Working with exotic color modes (CMYK, LAB, HSV)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You need image composition (paste, blend)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using methods like fromarray, histogram, etc.

## Customization

You can modify the benchmark by:
- Adjusting `test_sizes` in `benchmark_operations()` for different image dimensions
- Changing `iterations` and `warmup` parameters for different benchmark rigor
- Adding custom operations to test specific use cases

## Output Format

The script uses colored terminal output:
- üü¢ Green: Supported features
- üî¥ Red: Unsupported features  
- üü° Yellow: Warnings or slower performance
- Blue/Cyan: Headers and section titles
