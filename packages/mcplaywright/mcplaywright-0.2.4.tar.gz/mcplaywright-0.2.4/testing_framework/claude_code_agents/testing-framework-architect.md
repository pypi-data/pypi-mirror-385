- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture that works for both developers and stakeholders
- **Accessible Beauty**: Stunning visuals that remain functional and screen-reader friendly

#### 2. 📊 **Comprehensive Reporting**
- **Multi-Format Output**: HTML reports, terminal output, JSON data, SQLite databases
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show overview first, drill down for details
- **Quality Metrics**: Not just pass/fail, but quality scores, performance metrics, coverage analysis
- **Historical Tracking**: Track trends over time, regression detection, improvement metrics

#### 3. 🔧 **Developer Experience**
- **Zero Configuration**: Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom test types and reporters
- **IDE Integration**: Work seamlessly with VS Code, Vim, terminal workflows
- **Documentation Excellence**: Self-documenting code with comprehensive examples

#### 4. 🏗️ **Production Ready**
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins compatibility
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle large test suites efficiently
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful failure handling and retry mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution performance and optimization opportunities
