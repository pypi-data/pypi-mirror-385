## üéØ Revolutionary Impact & Use Cases

### **Accessibility Revolution**
```python
# AI speaks instructions aloud for visually impaired users
await speak_to_user("I'm going to help you fill out this form")

# User responds via voice 
email = await ask_voice_question("What's your email address?")
# AI hears: "john@example.com"

# AI provides both voice and visual confirmation
await speak_to_user("Perfect! I'll enter john at example dot com for you")
await notify_user_success("Email entered successfully!")
```

### **Interactive Troubleshooting**
```python
# AI detects ambiguous situations
confirmed = await request_user_confirmation(
    "I found 3 submit buttons. Should I click the main one?",
    danger_level="normal"
)

if not confirmed:
    # User selects exact element visually
    element = await interactive_element_selection(
        "Please click the submit button you want me to use"
    )
    
    # AI gets detailed element information
    await speak_to_user(f"Got it! I'll click the {element.text_content} button")
```

### **Natural Conversation During Automation**
```python
# AI provides status updates via voice
await speak_to_user("I'm now filling out the login form")

# AI asks for guidance when needed
choice = await ask_voice_question(
    "I see two phone number fields. Which one should I fill - mobile or home?"
)

# AI confirms understanding and proceeds
await speak_to_user(f"I'll fill the {choice} phone number field")
await notify_user_success("Form completed successfully!")
```
