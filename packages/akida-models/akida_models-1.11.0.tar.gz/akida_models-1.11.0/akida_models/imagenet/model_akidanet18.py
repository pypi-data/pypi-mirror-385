AkidaNet18 model definition for ImageNet classification.

AkidaNet18 architecture is inspired both from AkidaNet and ResNet18: same depth and dimensions than
ResNet18 but without skip connections and using SeparableConvolution layers.

    """Instantiates the AkidaNet18 architecture.

    Note: input preprocessing is included as part of the model (as a Rescaling layer). This model
    expects inputs to be float tensors of pixels with values in the [0, 255] range.

    Args:
        input_shape (tuple, optional): shape tuple. Defaults to None.
        include_top (bool, optional): whether to include the fully-connected
            layer at the top of the model. Defaults to True.
        pooling (str, optional): optional pooling mode for feature extraction
            when `include_top` is `False`.
            Defaults to None.

            * `None` means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor
              output of the last convolutional block.
            * `avg` means that global average pooling will be applied to the
              output of the last convolutional block, and thus the output of the
              model will be a 2D tensor.
        classes (int, optional): optional number of classes to classify images
            into, only to be specified if `include_top` is `True`. Defaults to 1000.
        depth (tuple, optional): number of layers in each stages of the model. The length of the
            tuple defines the number of stages. Defaults to (4, 4, 4, 4).
        dimensions (tuple, optional): number of filters in each stage on the model. The length of
            the tuple must be equal to the length of the `depth` tuple. Defaults to
            (64, 128, 256, 512).
        input_scaling (tuple, optional): scale factor and offset to apply to
            inputs. Defaults to (128, -1). Note that following Akida convention,
            the scale factor is an integer used as a divisor.

    Returns:
        keras.Model: a Keras model for AkidaNet/ImageNet.

    Raises:
        ValueError: in case of invalid input shape or mismatching `depth` and `dimensions`.
