def add_gamma_constraint(model):
    """ Method helper to add a MinValueConstraint to an existing model so that
    gamma values of its BatchNormalization layers are above a defined minimum.

    This is typically used to help having a model that will be Akida compatible
    after conversion. In some cases, the mapping on hardware will fail because
    of huge values for `threshold` or `act_step` with a message indicating that
    a value cannot fit in a 20 bit signed or unsigned integer.
    In such a case, this helper can be called to apply a constraint that can fix
    the issue.

    Note that in order for the constraint to be applied to the actual weights,
    some training must be done: for an already trained model, it can be on a few
    batches, one epoch or more depending on the impact the constraint has on
    accuracy. This helper can also be called to a new model that has not been
    trained yet.

    Args:
        model (keras.Model): the model for which gamma constraints will be
            added.

    Returns:
        keras.Model: the same model with BatchNormalisation layers updated.
