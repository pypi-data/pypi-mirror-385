# Why Upsonic?

Upsonic provides a feature set to build safety-first, high-performance AI Agents. It helps you go to production without spending hours on research and boilerplate. These are the main parts:

- **Safety First**: Upsonic provides its own **Safety Engine** that manages User and Agent messages and checks their status for your policies. You can customize it by designing new **rule** and **action** sets.
- **Direct LLM Calls**: In Upsonic we support the same interface for your whole AI operations. You don't need to go with another framework to complete your **small jobs**.
- **Structured Outputs**: Upsonic sets agent outputs to make them **Python objects**. So you can integrate your application without struggling with **LLM outputs**.
- **Built-in RAG and Memory**: In Upsonic you can create world class . We support the Agentic RAG, Memory Logics and providers of them.
- **Customizable Memory Logics**: You are able to create **memories** that focus on **user**, **event** and **chat**. Also you are free to use **Local** and **Cloud databases**.
- **Agent Teams**: Upsonic provides the most **reliable** agent team architecture with memory, context management and leader agent.
- **FastAPI Compatible Agents**: You can turn your agents into production-ready APIs
- **Tracking the Executions**: You can use <u>Upsonic AgentOS</u> to get the execution history, monthly costs andresponse times  of your agents.
- **Deploy at scale**: Upsonic agents work in the greatest and fastest-growing fintech companies and scaling is available on <u>Upsonic AgentOS</u>.



# üìô Documentation

You can access our documentation at [docs.upsonic.ai](https://docs.upsonic.ai/) All concepts and examples are available there.

## üìä Telemetry & Privacy

Upsonic uses **anonymous telemetry** to help us understand how the framework is being used and improve our development focus. We are committed to transparency and user privacy.

All telemetry is **anonymous** - we only track a randomly generated system ID to distinguish unique installations.

### Why Collect Telemetry?

Telemetry helps us:
- üéØ Focus development on frequently-used features
- üêõ Identify and fix common errors and edge cases
- üìà Understand performance characteristics at scale
- üîß Improve framework reliability

### How to Disable Telemetry

You can **completely disable** telemetry in multiple ways:

**Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
export UPSONIC_TELEMETRY=false
```

**Option 2: In Python Code**
```python
import os
os.environ["UPSONIC_TELEMETRY"] = "false"

from upsonic import Agent  # Import after setting env var
```

**Option 3: .env File**
```bash
# .env
UPSONIC_TELEMETRY=false
```

Once disabled, **no data** will be sent to our telemetry service.
