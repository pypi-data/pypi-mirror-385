    """
    A mapping preprocessor maps categorical values, discrete values and individual
    words in a text field to numerical values. These numerical values are retrieved
    by aggregating targets in the relational neighbourhood.

    You are particularly encouraged to use the mapping preprocessor in combination with
    [`FastProp`][getml.feature_learning.FastProp].

    Refer to the [User guide][preprocessing-mappings] for more information.

    Attributes:
        agg_sets:
            It is a class variable holding the available aggregation sets for the
            mapping preprocessor.
            Value: [`MAPPING`][getml.feature_learning.aggregations.sets.MAPPING].

    Parameters:
        aggregation:
            The aggregation function to use over the targets.

            Must be an aggregation supported by Mapping preprocessor
            ([`MAPPING_AGGREGATIONS`][getml.feature_learning.aggregations.sets.MAPPING_AGGREGATIONS]).

        min_freq:
            The minimum number of targets required for a value to be included in
            the mapping. Range: [0, âˆž]

        multithreading:
            Whether you want to apply multithreading.
