# NumAnalysis

NumAnalysis is a Python library for basic numerical linear algebra operations.  
It currently provides functions for LU decomposition and Cholesky decomposition, with checks for matrix properties (square, symmetric, positive definite, etc.).  
The library is designed to grow and include more numerical analysis tools over time.
