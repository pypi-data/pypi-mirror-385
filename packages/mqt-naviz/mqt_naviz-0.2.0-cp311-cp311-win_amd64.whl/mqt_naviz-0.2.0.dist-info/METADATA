# MQT NAViz - A Visualizer for Neutral Atom Quantum Computers

MQT NAViz is an open-source Rust and Python library to visualize atom movements of neutral atom quantum computers.
It is available at [https://munich-quantum-toolkit.github.io/naviz/](https://munich-quantum-toolkit.github.io/naviz/).
MQT NAViz is part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

  </a>
</p>

## Key Features

- Instant playback of the loaded input neutral atom quantum computation
- Export of the visualization as a video
- Scrubbable timeline to navigate through the visualization
- Fully customizable machine architecture specification
- Support for different input formats
- Fully customizable visualization style and clean predefined styles

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, run the following command to start the MQT NAViz GUI:

```console
cargo run -p naviz-gui
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/naviz).**

## System Requirements

Building MQT NAViz requires Rust 1.89 or newer (MSRV).
