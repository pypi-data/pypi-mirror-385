PELICAN documentation
=====================

This is an efficient reimplementation of the PELICAN architecture. 
PELICAN was first published at the `ML4PS workshop 2022 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00454>`_ and on `JHEP <https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16506>`_.
The official implementation is available on https://github.com/abogatskiy/PELICAN.

This implementation aims to improve efficiency and ease of use. 
For toptagging with batch size 100, we find 8x reduced memory usage and a 3x training speedup compared to the original implementation.
PELICAN can be used as the Frames-Net in `Lorentz Local Canonicalization (LLoCa) <https://github.com/heidelberg-hepml/lloca>`_.
