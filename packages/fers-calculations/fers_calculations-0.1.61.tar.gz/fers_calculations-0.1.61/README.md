# FERS_calculations

`FERS_calculations` is a high-performance library for Rust-backed calculations in mechanical engineering. It can process JSON input files to deliver fast and accurate results. While it can be run as a standalone tool, integration with `FERS_core` simplifies input creation and workflow management.

## Features

- **Standalone Functionality:** Run directly by providing a valid JSON input file.
- **Rust-Powered Performance:** Designed for speed and reliability in computational tasks.
- **Python Integration:** Seamless integration with `FERS_core` for easy preprocessing and result handling.
- **Engineer-Friendly Design:** Minimal coding effort required for complex structural engineering calculations.

## Usage

### Standalone
You can run `FERS_calculations` without `FERS_core` by preparing a JSON input file and running the binary directly.

```bash
# TODO: Add example of how to run FERS_calculations with a JSON input
