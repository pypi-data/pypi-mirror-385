# Checks if a gate is permeable on a set of qubits
# Permeable means that the gate has the form
# U = \sum_{x = 0}^{2^n} |x><x| U_x
# where the braket expression represents the qubits
# of the list "qubit_indices"
# {U_x | x <= 2^n} is a set of operations on the remaining qubits

# Applying a gate which is permeable on a register R to a computational basis state in R
# leaves the state of R invariant i.e. if R is in state |x>
# U |x>|y> = |x> U_x |y>
# this property will for instance be used to make sure that uncomputations,
# which depend on the state of R indeed stil recieve the original state of R
# when the uncomputation is performed. An error will be thrown if in the meantime,
# there have been non-permeable operations on R

# But what is the general strategy in determining this property?
# To understand this, note that if we order the computational basis vectors,
# such that all the qubits which are supposed to be checked for permeability are at the
# end.

# In this basis, the unitary is block diagonal, where the blocks on the diagonal are the
# U_x matrices, we check the block diagonality by first calculating the block matrices
# and then create a boolean 2^n x 2^n matrix, where the entry is False if the
# corresponding block matrix is 0


# We then check the diagonality of this matrix and return True if so
