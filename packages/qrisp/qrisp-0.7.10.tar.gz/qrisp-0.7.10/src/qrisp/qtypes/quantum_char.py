class QuantumChar(QuantumVariable):
    r"""
    A QuantumVariable which represents characters. By default, the QuantumChar is
    initialized in NISQ mode, meaning that instead of 256 characters it can only hold
    32, saving almost 40% in qubit cost.

    >>> from qrisp import QuantumChar
    >>> q_ch = QuantumChar(nisq_char = True)

    The chars which can be represented in ``nisq mode`` are

    If ``nisq_mode`` is set to False, the encoder uses the Python-inbuild chr function.
