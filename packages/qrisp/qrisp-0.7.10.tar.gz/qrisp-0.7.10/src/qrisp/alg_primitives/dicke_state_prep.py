def dicke_state(qv, k):
    """
    Dicke State initialization of a QuantumVariable, based on the deterministic alogrithm in https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07358.
    This algorithm creates an equal superposition of Dicke states for a given Hamming weight. The initial input variable has to be within this subspace.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qv : QuantumVariable
        Initial quantum variable to be prepared. Has to be in target subspace.
    k : Int
        The Hamming weight (i.e. number of "ones") for the desired dicke state


    Examples
    --------
    We initiate a QuantumVariable in the "0011" state and from this create the Dicke state with Hamming weight 2.

    ----------
    qv : QuantumVariable
        Initial quantum variable to be prepared. Has to be in target subspace.
    highIndex : Int
        Index for indication of preparation steps, as seen in original algorithm.
