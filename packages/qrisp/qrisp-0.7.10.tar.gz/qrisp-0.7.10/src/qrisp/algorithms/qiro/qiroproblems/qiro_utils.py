    Subroutine for finding the values with maximal correlation in the QIRO algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    single_cor : list
        Single qubit correlations to check.
    double_cor : list[tuple]
        Multi qubit correlations to check.
    res : dict
        Result dictionary of QAOA optimization procedure.
    solutions : List
        Qubits which were found to be positivel correlated, i.e., part of the problem solution.

    -------
    max_item, sign
        The item with maximal correlation and the sign of the correlation.
