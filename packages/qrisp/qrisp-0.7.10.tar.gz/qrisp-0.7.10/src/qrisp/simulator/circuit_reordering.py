# The functions in this file are supposed to reorder circuits in such a way,
# that measurements, resets and disentanglers are performed as early as possible.
# This is beneficial because the simulation of two decoherent states can be parallelized
# better. Furthermore, might the measurement of these imply that one of the states has
# vanishing probability, which means that this state does not require further
# simulation.

# The idea to achieve the ordering is to convert the circuit into a directed acyclic
# graph (now called causal graph), where two successive operations with overlapping
# qubits are represented with two nodes, connected by a directed edge. The directed
# edge, however points into the opposite direction of the sequential order of the
# operations. This way, if we want to evaluate what gates are necessary in order to
# perform a measurement, disentangling or reset, we simply have to look at the set of
# gates that is reachable from that specific node in the causal graph.

# Consider the following circuit
#           ┌───┐
#  qubit_9: ┤ X ├──■─────
#           ├───┤┌─┴─┐┌─┐
# qubit_10: ┤ Y ├┤ x ├┤M├
#           ├───┤└───┘└╥┘
# qubit_11: ┤ H ├──────╫─
#           └───┘      ║
#  clbit_0: ═══════════╩═

# In order to perform the measurement, we have to execute the x and the cx gate
# The corresponding causal graph
# (measure)-> (CX)->(X)
#               L->(Y)
# (H)
# We see that CX, X and Y are reachable from the measurement
# We now perform a depth first traversal on the subgraph of the nodes which are
# reachable from the measurement.

# It is important to node that for a regular depth first traversal,
# we are free to choose which child of a node to traverse next.
# This is not the casehere, because this might disturb the topological
# order, which would imply that we performed an illegitimat reordering
# Therefore, in this depth first traversal, we always traverse the child
# with the highest index in a topological order first.
