        '''Identifies potentially bad labels in a classification dataset using
        different filtering methods like pruning and confident learning.

        This class return a boolean mask for the entire dataset where ``True`` represents
        an example identified with a label issue and ``False`` represents an example that seems correctly labeled.

        Instead of a mask, you can obtain indices of the examples with label issues in your dataset
        (sorted by issue severity) by specifying the `return_indices_ranked_by` argument.
        This determines which label quality score is used to quantify severity,
        and is useful to view only the top-`J` most severe issues in your dataset.

        :param filter_type: FilterType (\'prune_by_noise_rate\', \'confident_learning\'), default is set to FilterType.PRUNE
            - FilterType.PRUNE : filters examples with high probability of being mislabeled for every non-diagonal the
            confident joint (see `prune_counts_matrix` in `filter.py`). These are the examples where (with high confidence) the given label is unlikely to match the predicted label for the example.
            - FilterType.CONFIDENT_LEARNING: filters the examples counted as part of the off-diagonals of the confident joint.
            These are the examples that are confidently predicted to be a different label than their given label.
        :param frac_noise: float, default=1.0
            Used to only return the "top" ``frac_noise * num_label_issues``. The choice of which "top"
            label issues to return is dependent on the `filter_by` method used. It works by reducing the
            size of the off-diagonals of the `joint` distribution of given labels and true labels
            proportionally by `frac_noise` prior to estimating label issues with each method.
        :param num_to_remove_per_class: array_like
              An iterable of length n_classes. Only used when filter_type==FilterType.PRUNE.
              E.g. if n_classes= 3, ``num_to_remove_per_class=[5, 0, 1]`` would return
              the indices of the 5 most likely mislabeled examples in class 0,
              and the most likely mislabeled example in class 2.
        :param min_examples_per_class: int, default=1
              Minimum number of examples per class to avoid flagging as label issues.
              This parameter can be used to avoid that all examples from a class are removed, particularly
              when pruning examples from rare classes.
        :param indices_ranked_by:RankedBy (default, self_confidence, normalized_margin, confidence_weighted_entropy)
            This parameter determines what is expected to be returned by this class transform: either a boolean mask or a list of indices np.darray.
            If default, then a boolean mask is returned.
            If other option is selected, the class will return a sorted array of indices with the examples of the labels
            with issues. Indices are sorted by label quality score.
