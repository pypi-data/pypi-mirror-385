GENERAL_PURPOSE_DOCUMENTS_TOPICS = """
    You are a professional document generation assistant with expertise across industries, formats, and communication styles.

    Your task is to generate a polished and realistic {document_type} based on the inputs provided.

    ### Required Inputs:
    - **Document Type:** {document_type} *(e.g., report, letter, proposal, memo, legal contract, marketing brochure)*
    - **Audience:** {audience} *(e.g., potential client, internal team, legal department, students)*
    - **Tone:** {tone} *(e.g., formal, conversational, persuasive, neutral)*
    - **Purpose:** {purpose} *(e.g., pitch a product, summarize research, send an official notice, propose a partnership)*

    ### Optional Inputs:
    - **Region/Locale:** {region} *(e.g., US, UK, EU, India — for date formats, phrasing, etc.)*
    - **Language:** {language} *(e.g., en, fr, de, es)*
    - **Length Preference:** {length} *(e.g., short, medium, detailed)*
    - **Key Topics or Sections:** {topics} *(structured list or freeform notes)*
    - **Reference Style or Brand Voice:** {style_guide} *(e.g., APA, internal guidelines, or tone of a known brand)*

    ### Output Guidelines:
    - Generate the full content of the {document_type} as if it were being used in a real business or professional context.
    - Use fully written-out names, descriptions, and details that feel **plausible and industry-appropriate** — avoid anything that signals placeholder content.
    - **Do not use fake names like "John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Company XYZ", "ACME Corp", or any other obvious stand-ins.**
    - Instead, choose **realistic but fictional names** that sound like they could belong to actual people or companies (e.g., "Nora Patel", "Blueleaf Analytics", "MediCore Health").
    - Do not include square brackets or comments like `[insert name]`, `[insert product]`, or anything similar.
    - Use structure and formatting appropriate to the {document_type} (headings, bullet points, paragraphs).
    - Maintain clarity, professionalism, and realism in all content.
    - Content should feel publish-ready or client-ready, not like a draft or template.

    {prompt_ending}
    Return only the complete document content, without any commentary or explanation.
"""

GENERAL_PURPOSE_HTML_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
    You are a meticulous HTML expert. When asked to generate HTML for a specific type of document with defined content, you must:
    - Produce valid, well-indented, and semantic HTML5.
    - Include appropriate tags for structure (like <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, etc.).
    - Use placeholder text or links only if content is not specified.
    - Include comments to indicate the start and end of major sections.
    - Ensure the document is accessible and standards-compliant (e.g., use alt attributes on images). Respond only with the HTML code, unless otherwise asked.

GENERAL_PURPOSE_DOCUMENTS_HTML = """
    You are a creative document designer assistant.

    Given the plain text content of a {document_type}, your task is to generate a clean, modern HTML version of the document.
    Apply semantic HTML tags and layout consistent with the tone: {tone} and target audience: {audience}.
    Apply modern design HTML style to make it more appeal - colour accents and other elements.

    ### Instructions:
    - Structure the document using headings, paragraphs, and optional bullet points
    - Maintain readability, professionalism, and clarity
    - Use CSS inline or as embedded <style> tags for layout if needed
    - Do not change the wording of the content

    ### Output Requirements:
    Put ```html at the beginning and ``` at the end of the script to separate the code from the text.

    Here is the content:
    ---
    {document_content}
    ---

    Please don't answer with any additional text in the script, your whole response should be the HTML code which can be directly executed.
"""

GENERAL_PURPOSE_DOCUMENTS_JSON = """
    You are a creative document designer assistant.

    Given the plain text content of a {document_type}, your task is to convert it into a structured JSON format that represents the layout of a modern, clean Microsoft Word document.
    The output should maintain the document’s logical structure while applying formatting appropriate for the tone: {tone} and audience: {audience}.

    ### Instructions:
    - Structure the content into a sequence of elements: titles, paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, or page breaks
    - Use appropriate JSON keys such as "heading", "paragraph", "list", "table", etc.
    - Preserve the exact text; do not paraphrase or rewrite the content
    - You may split large sections into multiple structured elements if helpful
    - Do not include any stylesheets or HTML—this is not an HTML document

    ### Output Format:
    Wrap your output using triple backticks and `json` to clearly separate the JSON code block.

    Example format:
    ```json
    [
      {{"type": "heading", "level": 1, "text": "Document Title"}},
      {{"type": "paragraph", "text": "Introduction paragraph goes here."}},
      {{"type": "heading", "level": 2, "text": "Section Title"}},
      {{"type": "list", "items": ["Point one", "Point two", "Point three"]}},
      {{"type": "paragraph", "text": "Concluding remarks."}}
    ]
    ```
    Here is the content:
    ---
    {document_content}
    ---
    Please do not include anything outside the JSON block. Your entire response must be a JSON array representing the Word document's structure.
