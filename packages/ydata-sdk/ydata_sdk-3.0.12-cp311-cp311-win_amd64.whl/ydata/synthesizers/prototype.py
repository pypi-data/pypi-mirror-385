    A synthesizer has a block strategy, itself composed of a Segmentation and a Slice strategy.
    The result of a block strategy is a way to decompose an input dataset into blocks.

    The Pipeline Prototype describes how to preprocess the data at each step of the decomposition:
        - Globally (before any segmentation or slicing)
        - Segment
        - Block

    The BlockScope also describes the class of Synthesizer model to use, e.g. CartHierarchical.

    The Pipeline Prototype also holds contextual information such as the device on which the synthesizer
    instance should be trained, e.g. CPU, GPU.
