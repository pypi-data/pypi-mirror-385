        Because 'easy to understand' is specific to the pipeline, we let the pipeline superseeds the default plot via
        the step `representation`.
        However, because a plot must be 1D or 2D, we provide default visualization for such cases. A HUGE assumption
        done for the default plot is that the columns are sorted by importance. It is the case for most projection objects
        such as PCA, ICA or any other technique but for more *custom* representation it should be taken into account.

        note(aquemy): only the 2D plots is implemented right now. Not sure how to integrate a 1D plot. Maybe a flag at the OutlierSteps definition?
