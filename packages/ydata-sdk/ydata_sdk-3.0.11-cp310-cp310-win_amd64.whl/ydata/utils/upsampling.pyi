def random_walk_upsample(data: DataFrame, n_upsample: int = 5) -> DataFrame:
    """
    Function to upsample the data with a random walk. What the function does is to calculate
    the difference between the 2 dates to upsample (17.00: 357, 18.00: 400, diff = 43) and calculate a
    random movement from that position.

    Args:
        data: pd.DataFrame. The dataframe to upsample.
        n_upsample: int. Number of additioned value wanted.
                         (i.e. if you have hourly data and want 10minutes window.
                         17.00 to 18.00 there are 5 values that you want to add:
                         [17.10, 17.20, 17.30, 17.40, 17.50])

    Returns: pd.DataFrame. The dataframe with upsampled data.

    Args:
        data: pd.DataFrame. The data to be upsampled. NB. Needs to have a DateTimeIndex.
        time_to_resample: str. Frequency string to use. The frequencies can be found here:

        add_noise: bool. True if you want to add noise to the linear interpolation.
        noise_reduction: float. Number between 0 and 1 to reduce the level of noise you want.
                                the closer to 0 the less noise you are going to input in the linear interpolation.

    Returns: pd.DataFrame. DataFrame resampled and linearly interpolated w/ or w/o noise.
