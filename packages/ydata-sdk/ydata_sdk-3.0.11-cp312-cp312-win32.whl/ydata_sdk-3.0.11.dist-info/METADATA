Each party disclosing Confidential Information hereunder is a “Discloser,” and each party receiving Confidential Information hereunder is a “Recipient.” Confidential Information does not include any information that a Recipient can demonstrate is (a) rightfully furnished to Recipient without restriction by a third party without breach of any separate obligation to Discloser, (b) generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement, or (c) independently developed by Recipient without reliance on information of Discloser, as evidenced by prior written records.
        
        Non-use and Nondisclosure Obligations: Except for the specific rights granted by this Agreement, Recipient may not possess, use or disclose any Confidential Information of Discloser without Discloser’s prior written consent, and must use reasonable care to protect the Confidential Information. Recipient may only disclose Confidential Information to its employees and contractors who have a need to know for the purposes of this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality obligations that are at least as protective as the provisions herein. Recipient will be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its employees and contractors. Promptly after expiration of the Term (or, at Discloser’s request, at any time), Recipient must return all tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records and materials developed therefrom.
        
        Legal Requirements: If Recipient receives a request to disclose any Confidential Information, whether pursuant to a valid subpoena or an order issued by a court or regulatory body (“Ordering Party”), and on advice of legal counsel such disclosure is required by law, then prior to disclosure, Recipient must (unless prohibited by law or such order) (a) notify Discloser of the terms of such request and advice, (b) cooperate with YData in taking lawful steps to resist, narrow, or eliminate the need for that disclosure, and (c) if disclosure is nonetheless required, work with Discloser to take into account Discloser’s reasonable requirements as to the timing, content and manner of disclosure and use best efforts to obtain a protective order or other binding assurance from the Ordering Party that confidential treatment will be afforded to the Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed. The foregoing is without limitation of Discloser’s ability to seek a protective order or other relief limiting such disclosure; in such a case, you must cooperate in such efforts by Discloser.

        General. Except for disputes relating to your or YData’s intellectual property, you agree that all disputes between you and YData (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the YData Software, or YData’s Privacy Policy shall be finally resolved by arbitration conducted in the English language in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), and you and YData hereby expressly waive trial by jury.

The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (except that the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such an amount as may be determined by the arbitrator). All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding this, application may be made to any court for a judicial acceptance of the award or order of enforcement. Under no circumstances shall the arbitrator be authorized to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement.
        
        Right to Opt Out. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor YData can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify YData in writing within thirty (30) days after the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. The opt out notice must state that you do not agree to the agreement to arbitrate and must include your name, address and phone number to which the opt out applies and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. You must sign the opt out notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and YData agree that if YData makes any change to the arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or Site link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if YData seeks to terminate the arbitration procedures from this Agreement, such termination shall not be effective until thirty (30) days after the version of this Agreement not containing the arbitration procedures is posted to the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding prior to the effective date of removal. This agreement to arbitrate will survive the termination of your relationship with YData.
        
        ## **General Terms**
        
        Marketing and Promotion. You agree that YData may mention your associated entity and use its logo within its promotional and marketing material.
        
        Export Restrictions.

However, if you or the entity for which you are accessing and using the YData Software have a separate binding written agreement in place with YData with respect to the YData Software, that separate agreement shall take precedence over this Agreement in the event of a conflict.
        
        No Assignment. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part to any third party without YData’s written consent.
        
        Binding Effect. These Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns.
        
        Independent Contractors. YData and you are independent contractors and are not partners, joint venturers, agents, employees or representatives of the other party.
        
        Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
        
        English Language. These Terms are in English only, which will be controlling in all respects. No version of this Agreement in another language will be binding or of any effect.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will not apply to this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, YData may commence appropriate legal action in any jurisdiction to protect the YData Software or Confidential Information.
        
        No Class Action. Any claims brought by you or YData must be brought in that party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Neither you nor YData will participate in a class action for any claims covered by this Agreement. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related to this Agreement and the Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.
        
        Remedies Cumulative. Unless specifically provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity.
        
        Injunctive Relief. You agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of confidentiality, license grant or restrictions or proprietary rights, YData will suffer irreparable damage for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, YData will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting any bond.

## Overview

The YData SDK is the leading Python package for data analytics, data science, data engineering and AI development. The solution runs locally and includes a set of integrated components for data ingestion, standardized data quality evaluation, data improvement, and synthetic data generation.

Synthetic data can be used as Machine Learning performance enhancer, to augment or mitigate the presence of bias in real data. Furthermore, it can be used as a Privacy Enhancing Technology, to enable data-sharing initiatives or even to fuel testing environments.

Under the YData SDK hood, you can find a set of algorithms and metrics based on statistics and deep learning based techniques, that will help you to accelerate your data preparation.

## Modules

YData SDK is composed by the following main modules:

- **Connectors & Data Sources**
  - Built-in connectors for easy integration with existing data sources. It supports several storage types, such as filesystems, RDBMS, Data warehouses, Lakehouses and much more. Check the list of connectors in the documentation.
  - SDK’s Datasources run on top of Dask, which allows it to deal with not only small workloads but also larger volumes of data.


- **Data Profiling**
  - Automatically generate the visualizations you need for your EDA.
  - A set of metrics and algorithms summarizes datasets quality in three main dimensions: warnings, univariate analysis and a multivariate perspective.


- **Synthetic Data Generation**
  - Generate synthetic data with a few lines of code and streamlite your data access, overcome data privacy concerns and enrich your datastes.
  - Simplified interface to train a generative model and learn in a data-driven manner the behavior, the patterns and original data distribution. Optimize your model for privacy or utility use-cases.
  - From a trained synthesizer, you can generate synthetic samples as needed and parametrise the number of records needed.


- **Synthetic Data quality Report** 
  - An extensive synthetic data quality report that measures 3 dimensions: privacy, utility and fidelity of the generated data. The report can be downloaded in PDF format for ease of sharing and compliance purposes or as a JSON to enable the integration in data flows.

## Features

YData SDK has several festures and for the complete set of features, please refer to the documentation. Among the most popular you can find:

- **Generate a Profile Report**
  - The most comprehensive and easy to use profile report / exploratory data analysis.
- **Generate Synthetic Data**
  - Generate either Tabular or Time-Series data using the best models worldwide!
- **Generate a Comparison Report**
  - Compare two datasets with a single line of code. Let the visualizations do the work for you.


### Supported data formats

- **Tabular**
The **RegularSynthesizer** is perfect to synthesize high-dimensional data, that is time-independent with high quality results.
- **Time-Series**
The **TimeSeriesSynthesizer** is perfect to synthesize both regularly and not evenly spaced time-series, from smart-sensors to stock.



## Installation

From PyPi

```sh
python -m pip install ydata-sdk
```

From Anaconda

```sh
conda install ydata-sdk
```

## After Installation

We depend on spacy models for some parts and as spaCy documentation, you have to manually install them.

```sh
python -m pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-3.8.0/en_core_web_lg-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
