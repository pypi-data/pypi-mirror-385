    """
    The xDS protocol has four different transport variants: Basic, Incremental
    Basic, Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS), and Incremental ADS. For more
    info, see [1].

    Any of these variants can communicate the same information. We implement
    (only) ADS (the non-incremental version) here, because:

    1. Aggregated, because it is the only transport that can guarantee
       sequencing of cluster/listener updates (see below). This allows for
       no-downtime updates of Envoy configurations, for example when shifting
       traffic from one cluster to another. ADS allows us to guarantee that the
       new cluster is added and listeners are updated before the old cluster is
       removed.
    2. Non-incremental, because incremental updates are not worth the complexity
       in our use case. Our configurations are not that big, and all
       communication with clients is local to the host.

    ADS serves two kinds of resources:

    * Clusters are upstream backends that Envoy can route traffic to. In
      Reboot, these are the consensuses.
    * Listeners are the ports that Envoy listens on, and the rules that it
      applies to traffic arriving on those ports.

    Users of this class set the latest versions of these resources by calling
    `set_config`. This server takes care of streaming the latest versions of
    these resources to clients that want them.
